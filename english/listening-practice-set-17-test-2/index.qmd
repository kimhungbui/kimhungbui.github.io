# Cambridge IELTS 17 - listening test 2




# Performance Summary


# Recording 1

## **Q2 ‚Äî**¬†**records** **(you wrote ‚Äúrecord‚Äù)**

- In the audio Jane says: ‚Äú**the records that we keep** of the books we‚Äôre given, and those we borrow‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Üí clear **plural**.
    
- Tip: after verbs like **keep/maintain/update**, IELTS often expects a plural noun when tracking multiple items (e.g., _keep_ **_records_** _of books_, _keep_ **_lists_** _of names_).
    
- Sound cue: listen for the /z/ at the end: **record** /Ààrek…îÀêd/ vs **records** /Ààrek…îÀêdz/.
    
- Quick fix drill: say the phrase aloud 5√ó ‚Äî ‚Äúkeep **records** of the books‚Äù.
    

  

## **Q8 ‚Äî**¬†**quiz****(you wrote ‚Äúquizz‚Äù)**

- The event is ‚Äúa **quiz**‚Äù (singular). Spelling: **quiz** (one _z_).
    
- Only the **plural** doubles the z: **quizzes** (quiz ‚Üí quizzes).
    
- Tip: If the article is **a/an**, think _singular form_. If it‚Äôs after a number or plural context, think _plural form and spelling change_.
    

---

## **Mini pre-submit checklist (Listening gaps)**

1. Does the speaker add an **-s / -z** sound? ‚Üí write plural.
    
2. Does the note use **a/an**? ‚Üí singular (e.g., _a quiz_).
    
3. Common collocations: **keep records**, **take notes**, **check tickets**.
    
4. Spelling traps: **quiz/quizzes**, **library**, **reference**, **ticket(s)**.


# Recording 2

## **‚úÖ Quick fix on your wrong one**

- **Q19 (shed)** ‚Üí The audio says: _‚ÄúOutside the shed ‚Ä¶ you can_ **_climb into a horse‚Äëdrawn carriage_** _for a tour.‚Äù_
    
    ‚Üí That‚Äôs **starting a trip** (**E**), not _using farming tools_ (those were in the **large barn**, Q16).
    

---

## **üéØ Traps & Signals (what the test tried to trick you with)**

- **Building vs. Activity**:
    
    - _Large barn_ = tools (C); _Small barn_ = grooming animals (G); _Stables_ = shop (A); _Shed_ = start carriage tour (E).
        
    
- **‚ÄúNo longer / Until recently / Now‚Äù**:
    
    - _Dairy_ **used to** make cheese ‚Üí **now** food & drink (D).
        
    - _Horses no longer live in the stables_ ‚Üí stables = **shop** (A).
        
    
- **‚ÄúLatest addition‚Äù** = new for kids ‚Üí **mini tractors** (B) for Q14.
    
- **Role of owners**: ‚Äúleft their mark by **adding rooms or demolishing others**‚Äù ‚Üí changes to the **house** (Q11 = B).
    
- **Paraphrase traps**:
    
    - ‚ÄúHosted painters and poets‚Äù ‚Üí **a place for artists and writers** (Q12 = C).
        
    - ‚ÄúVolunteers dressed as servants‚Äù ‚Üí **people in costume** (Q13 = C).
        
    - ‚ÄúTypes of cattle and sheep that are hardly ever found‚Äù ‚Üí **rare breeds** (Q20 = F).

# Recording 3

### **Q29****‚Äì Watching**¬†**Romeo and Juliet** **in another language**

  

üîë Transcript:

- _Gemma_: ‚ÄúReally interesting. I expected it to be more challenging, but I could follow pretty well.‚Äù
    
- _Ed_: ‚ÄúI stopped worrying about not understanding every word and focused on expressions. **The ending was pretty powerful.**‚Äù
    
- _Gemma_: ‚ÄúYes, that somehow **intensified the emotion** for me.‚Äù
    

  

‚úÖ This shows the experience was **emotionally strong** ‚Üí **C. moving**.

‚ùå Not ‚Äúfrustrating‚Äù (they didn‚Äôt complain) and not ‚Äúdemanding‚Äù (Gemma even said it was _easier than expected_).

---

### **Q30****‚Äì Shakespeare‚Äôs international appeal**

  

üîë Transcript:

- _Ed_: ‚ÄúHis plays are about **basic themes people everywhere are familiar with**.‚Äù
    
- _Gemma_: ‚ÄúYeah, and they can also be **understood on different levels**. The characters have depth.‚Äù
    
- _Ed_: ‚Äú‚Ä¶which allows directors to experiment and **find new angles**.‚Äù
    

  

‚úÖ The key is: _can be interpreted in many ways_ ‚Üí **C**.

‚ùå Not ‚Äúexciting stories‚Äù (A) and not just ‚Äúrecognisable characters‚Äù (B).


# Recording 4

**Q34 ‚Äì SMARTPHONES**

- **Your answer:** SMARTPHONE (singular)
    
- **Correct answer:** SMARTPHONES (plural)
    
- **Reason:** The passage says:
    
    > ‚ÄúThink about smartphones. They didn‚Äôt even exist until comparatively recently, but today young people use them all the time‚Ä¶‚Äù
    
    > The plural form is required because the speaker refers to the widespread use of many devices, not just one.
    

  

**Q36 ‚Äì PLAYGROUND**

- **Your answer:** CONVERSATION
    
- **Correct answer:** PLAYGROUND
    
- **Reason:** The passage says:
    
    > ‚Äúteachers have found that playground conversations in Icelandic secondary schools can be conducted entirely in English‚Ä¶‚Äù
    
    > The notes require the **location** where discussions occur, not the activity itself. So ‚Äúplayground‚Äù (location) is correct rather than ‚Äúconversation‚Äù (activity).
    

  

The key is to match what the notes are asking for‚Äî**context/location vs. action** and **plural vs. singular**.



- Tip: after verbs like **keep/maintain/update**, IELTS often expects a plural noun when tracking multiple items (e.g., _keep_ **_records_** _of books_, _keep_ **_lists_** _of names_).

## **IELTS Speaking Sample ‚Äì Band 7**

  

### **Part 2 ‚Äì Long Turn (3‚Äì4 minutes)**

  

**Cue Card:** Describe a performance of a play or film that you recently watched. You should say:

- What it was
    
- What you liked and disliked about it
    
- How it made you feel
    
- And explain why it was memorable
    

  

**Sample Answer:**

  

_I recently watched a production of Romeo and Juliet at The Emporium Theatre. I had read the play before, but watching it live was very different. The set was really impressive and probably the most memorable part. The lighting helped create the mood in many scenes, although some parts were quite dark and hard to see. The costumes were modern, which I didn‚Äôt expect, but I think it worked. I liked the music at the start, but later it didn‚Äôt have much effect. One thing I didn‚Äôt like was that some actors spoke too fast or quietly, so I couldn‚Äôt always understand them. Overall, the performance was emotional and made me think about the story and the characters. It was a very interesting experience, and I could see why Shakespeare‚Äôs plays are still popular today._

### **Part 3 ‚Äì Discussion (4‚Äì5 minutes)**

  

**Topic: Theatre, Culture, and Literature**

1. Why do people still perform classic plays?
    
    - _I think it‚Äôs because the story and themes are still relevant. Family problems, love, and conflicts are things everyone can understand, even now._
        
    
2. How important is the director in a play?
    
    - _The director is very important. They decide how the actors move, how the stage looks, and how the play is shown to the audience. This can make a big difference to how much people enjoy it._
        
    
3. What makes a performance memorable?
    
    - _Good acting, interesting sets, and music can make it memorable. Also, if the audience can feel the emotions of the characters, it is more likely to stay in their minds._
        
    
4. Does watching a play in another language change the experience?
    
    - _Yes, it can be harder to understand, but watching the actors and their expressions helps. Sometimes, the feelings come through even if you don‚Äôt understand every word._
        
    
5. Why are Shakespeare‚Äôs plays famous around the world?
    
    - _They can be interpreted in many ways. Directors can change the time or place of the story, and the characters are complex, so people everywhere can relate to them._

## **IELTS Speaking Sample ‚Äì Band 7.5**

  

### **Part 2 ‚Äì Long Turn (3‚Äì4 minutes)**

  

**Cue Card:** Describe a performance of a play or film that you recently watched. You should say:

- What it was
    
- What you liked and disliked about it
    
- How it made you feel
    
- And explain why it was memorable
    

  

**Sample Answer:**

  

_Recently, I watched a production of Romeo and Juliet at The Emporium Theatre. I had read the play before, but seeing it performed live was a completely different experience. The set design was visually stunning and probably the most memorable aspect of the performance. The lighting created the right atmosphere for different scenes, though some moments were a bit dim and hard to follow. The costumes were contemporary, which surprised me initially, but ultimately I thought it worked well and added a fresh perspective. The music at the start was brilliant, though it didn‚Äôt have much impact later in Acts 2 and 3, which was a little disappointing. One aspect that I think could have been improved was the actors‚Äô delivery of lines. Some spoke too quickly, while others weren‚Äôt loud enough, which made it difficult to catch every word. Overall, the performance had a powerful emotional effect on me, particularly the ending, which intensified the drama. I found it a very engaging and thought-provoking experience, and it reminded me why Shakespeare‚Äôs works remain so relevant today._

### **Part 3 ‚Äì Discussion (4‚Äì5 minutes)**

  

**Topic: Theatre, Culture, and Literature**

1. Why do you think classic plays like _Romeo and Juliet_ are still performed today?
    
    - _I think it‚Äôs because the themes are universal and timeless. Issues such as family tension, love, and conflict are still very relatable. Even though society has changed a lot since Shakespeare‚Äôs time, these basic human experiences remain relevant._
        
    
2. How important is the role of the director in a theatre production?
    
    - _The director plays a crucial role in interpreting the text and deciding how to use the theatre space, lighting, and music to create the desired emotional impact. A skilled director can make a familiar story feel fresh and engaging._
        
    
3. What makes a performance memorable for the audience?
    
    - _A combination of factors: compelling acting, imaginative set and costume design, and an emotional connection. If the audience can relate to the characters or feel the tension and drama, it leaves a lasting impression._
        
    
4. Do you think watching plays in translation affects your understanding?
    
    - _It can initially be challenging, but expressions, gestures, and acting often convey the meaning effectively. I found that focusing on non-verbal cues helped me appreciate the performance even if I didn‚Äôt understand every word._
        
    
5. Why are Shakespeare‚Äôs plays so popular internationally?
    
    - _They‚Äôre versatile and can be interpreted in many ways. Directors can experiment with different settings, costumes, or time periods while keeping the story‚Äôs essence intact. Also, the characters are complex, which allows audiences across cultures to connect with them._

# Complex noun phrases 

Long, complex noun phrases are typical of academic writing, allowing a lot of information to be included within one sentence element. They can make up ^[üîç *"make up"* means to **form**, **constitute**, or **compose**.  
Used in: *They can make up substantial parts of academic texts* ‚Üí *They form a large part of...*] substantial parts of academic texts as subjects, objects, and complements. The complex noun phrases in this extract are in italics with the main noun in each phrase in bold.

::: {.column-margin}
**üîç "make up" (phrasal verb)**  
Means:  
- **form**  
- **constitute**  
- **compose**

üìò Example meaning:  
> Complex noun phrases **make up** (= form) large parts of academic writing.

The __changes__ in map data collection and representation that have arisen with the introduction of computers and digital techniques are remarkable. __Information__ that used to be collected manually from surveys and ground observations can now be collected almost instantaneously by orbiting __satellites__ that send data to Earth at the speed of light. __Maps__ that were once hand-drawn can now be produced on a computer and printed out in a relatively short __amount__ of time.

Note the word order in complex noun phrases -

- The most common elements _before_ the main noun in a complex noun phrase are: determiners (e.g. _a, the_), and adjectives (_e.g. orbiting_)
- The most common elements _after_ the main noun are: relative clauses (_e.g.: that were once hand-drawn_), and adjectives (_e.g. orbiting_)
- After the main noun in particular, elements are often embedded within others. For example, the relative clause _that have arisen with the introduction of computers_ includes the prepositional phrase _with the introduction of computers_ which in turn includes the prepositional phrase of _computers_.


In academic writing we tend to use nouns to talk about _actions_ and _processes_ (more typically associated with verbs), and _qualities_ (more typically associated with adjectives). This use of a noun to convey a meaning usually expressed with a word from another class is referred to as _nominalization_, and this process often results in a complex noun phrase. Compare the noun phrases in these two texts:

(i) Organizations have reported that __the number of people volunteering has decreased rapidly__ in recent years. At the same time, __more opportunities to volunteer have become available__.

(ii) __An extremely rapid decrease in volunteering__ has been reported in recent years. At the same time, __the availability of opportunities to volunteer has increased__.

Where (i) uses a verb (_has decreased_) and adjective (_available_), (ii), more typical of academic writing, uses nouns (_decrease, availability_).

#  Complex prepositions

Complex prepositions comprise two, three or four words. Some of these occur more frequently in academic writing than in general use. For example:

- __As for__ the future, demand for electricity is expected to grow at a rate of 5% per annum. (= regarding)
- The final chapter considers inequalities in health __with reference to__ race and gender. (= what it is about)
- Monthly average temperatures were higher than average __with the exception of__ June. (= not including)

:::{.collum-margin}
Also: __as a result of, as distinct from, as opposed to, depending on, in comparison with, in line with, in the case of, irrespective of, on the part of, prior to, regardless of__
:::

Note that four-word prepositions usually end in _of_ and include an article.

Complex prepositions often occur as part of complex noun phrases:

- This essay has discussed _class identity_ __with reference to__ _gender differences_.
- The study found a _less positive attitude_ __in the case of__ _customers exposed_ to _advertising and marketing communications_.

:::{.margin-note}
in sentence 9, we do not use "are depending on"

‚ùå Incorrect tense and verb choice

‚úÖ Should be: ‚Äúdepend on‚Äù or ‚Äúare based on‚Äù if you mean origin

‚ùå But in your sentence, you're not comparing cause ‚Äî you're comparing difference, so this phrase isn't needed at all.

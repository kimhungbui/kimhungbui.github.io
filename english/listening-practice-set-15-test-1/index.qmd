| Question | My answer | Corrected     | ISSUE                             |
| -------- | --------- | ------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 3        | BUSINESS  | COMMUNICATION | __Spelling mistake__ / Mishearing |

WILLIAM: I wouldn't worry. They'll probably start you as a receptionist, or something like that. So what's important for that kind of job isn't so much having business skills or knowing lots of different computer systems – it's communication (Q3) that really matters – so you'd be fine there.

💡 Why?

William contrasts what is not important with what is important. Let's break it down:

He says "it isn't so much having business skills or knowing lots of different computer systems."

Then he clearly emphasizes: "it's communication that really matters."

So, he's saying communication is the most important skill for these roles — not business skills or technical computer knowledge.

This makes communication the correct word for Q3.

❗ Why it's wrong:

You misunderstood the negative structure of the sentence:

“It isn't so much business skills…” → means business skills are not the most important.

You heard “business skills” and assumed it was the answer because it sounded related.

You also mentioned you thought “skills” was plural, and “business” felt like a category.

This is a common mistake when learners miss negative contrast signals like “isn't” or “not as important as…”


How to Avoid This Mistake in the Future

👂 Listening Tip:

Pay close attention to negatives and contrasts. Phrases like:

“It's not so much...”

“The most important thing is...”

“More than... it's...”

These show the speaker is making a comparison — the second part is usually the correct answer.

🧠 Practice Sentence Structures:

“It's not so much X, but Y.” → Y is more important.

“What matters most is Y, not X.” → Again, Y is the answer.

| ❗ Why It Was Wrong    | You focused on the **benefit** (entrance) instead of what was **provided** (pass) |
| 💡 Key Learning Point | Focus on **what is given** vs. **what it allows**                                 |

Complete the sentence:

Company provides a __________ for local transport and heritage sites.

🔍 Transcript Focus – Q18 Section:

"Day four is free for you to explore, using the __pass__ which we'll give you. So you won't have to pay for travel on local transport, or for entrance to the island's heritage sites."

✅ Correct Answer: pass

💡 Why?

The speaker clearly says they will give you a pass.

The pass allows you to:

Use local transport

Enter heritage sites for free

So the thing the company provides is a pass — not the entrance itself. The entrance is free, but only because of the pass.

❌ Your Answer: entrance

❗ Why It's Incorrect:

You probably focused on the phrase: “entrance to the island's heritage sites” and assumed that was the answer.

However, “entrance” is not what is being provided.

Instead, the company provides a "pass", and that pass grants you free entrance.

So, this is a case of not following the logic of the sentence:

What is provided? → a pass

What does it allow? → free entrance

# Recording 3

|Q#|Your Answer|✅ Correct Answer|Why Yours Was Wrong|
|---|---|---|---|
|21|H – competitive|G – caring|“Nurturing” links directly to _caring_, not competitiveness|
|22|G – caring|F – co-operative|Middle children are described as helpful and easy to get on with|
|25|D – attention-seeking|B – selfish|Only children seen as self-centered, not attention-seeking|
|30|A – learning to share|B & D – stand up for oneself, be tolerant|Ed **didn't** share; both mention standing up and tolerating siblings|
❌ Question 21:

What personality trait is associated with the eldest child?

Your answer: H – competitive

Correct answer: G – caring

🔍 Transcript says:

"Some studies claimed that they were thought to be good at nurturing – certainly in the past when people had large families they would have been expected to look after the younger ones."

✅ Why G is correct:

Nurturing directly matches G: caring

This was a positive trait assigned to eldest children in older, larger families

❌ Why H (competitive) is wrong:

Nowhere in the transcript is competitiveness mentioned regarding eldest children.

❌ Question 22:

What personality trait is associated with a middle child?

Your answer: G – caring

Correct answer: F – co-operative

🔍 Transcript says:

"One trait that a lot of the studies mention is that they are easier to get on with... Generally eager to please and helpful."

✅ Why F is correct:

“Easier to get on with,” “eager to please,” and “helpful” all suggest co-operative

❌ Why G (caring) is wrong:

While being “helpful” and “eager to please” might sound like “caring,” the word “co-operative” better captures the idea of getting along well with others, which is what the transcript emphasizes.

❌ Question 25:

What personality trait is associated with an only child?

Your answer: D – attention-seeking

Correct answer: B – selfish

🔍 Transcript says:

"Only children have had a really bad press – a lot of studies have branded them as loners who think the world revolves around them because they've never had to fight for their parents' attention."

✅ Why B is correct:

Thinking “the world revolves around them” matches the idea of selfishness

❌ Why D (attention-seeking) is wrong:

The phrase “never had to fight for attention” implies they don't need to seek attention — they already have it.

❌ Question 30:

Which experience of sibling rivalry do both speakers agree was valuable?

Your answer: A – learning to share

Correct answers: B – learning to stand up for oneself, D – learning to be tolerant

🔍 Transcript says:

Ruth: “My younger brother was incredibly annoying… but I think this has made me a stronger person. I know how to defend myself.”

“...we had to put up with each other” → shows tolerance

Ed: “Yes, my situation was pretty similar.”

✅ Why B and D are correct:

B: stand up for oneself → matches “defend myself”

D: be tolerant → matches “put up with each other”

❌ Why A (learning to share) is wrong:

Ed specifically says:

“I was never prepared to let my brothers use any of my stuff.”

So they did NOT learn to share!

🎯 How to Improve:

✅ 1. Match Meaning, Not Just Keywords

Don't just pick a word that sounds vaguely related — match the intent and meaning, especially when traits are described using different language.

✅ 2. Watch for Negative Statements

“Never had to fight for attention” ≠ “attention-seeking”

Pay attention to what the speaker is contrasting or rejecting

✅ 3. Use Process of Elimination

For each trait option, ask: “Was this clearly supported?” Eliminate ones with no textual evidence.

Mundulla Yellows – Cause: lime used for making __________ was absorbed

🔍 Relevant Transcript Segment:

“It wasn't until 2004 that they found the cause of the problem was lime, or calcium hydroxide to give it its proper chemical name, which was being used in the construction of roads. The lime was being washed away into the ground and affecting the roots of the eucalyptus trees nearby.”

✅ Correct Answer: roads

💡 Why?

The lime (calcium hydroxide) was used in building roads.

It affected the soil and caused the eucalyptus trees to suffer because it interfered with iron absorption.

So the missing word is “roads”, as the construction of roads was the source of the lime contamination.

❌ Your Answer: “roast”

❗ Why It's Incorrect:

Likely due to a listening error caused by fast speech or unfamiliar pronunciation.

The word "roads" may have sounded like “roast” because:

The /d/ sound in "roads" is soft and might blend with other words.

You may not have expected “roads” to be related to eucalyptus trees, so you misinterpreted the context.

“Roast” doesn't logically fit here — it has no connection to lime or tree health.

🔁 IELTS Listening Strategy: How to Avoid This Mistake

👂 1. Use Context to Predict Answers

Before listening, read the sentence:

"Lime used for making ________ was absorbed…"

Lime is commonly used in construction, so possible logical answers include roads, buildings, etc.

“Roast” doesn't fit this context. Always cross-check with logic.

✍️ 2. Note Word Relationships

The phrase “used for making roads” is collocated (words that commonly go together).

Learn common collocations like:

build/make roads, bridges, buildings

roast meat, coffee, etc.

🎧 3. Practice with Accents

Native speakers may pronounce "roads" quickly: /rəʊdz/ – especially in Australian/British accents.

Practice listening to Australian speakers to get used to this rhythm and pronunciation.

## Summary  
To master the full range of advanced grammar needed for IELTS Band 8 in Speaking and Writing, focus your study on the following units in *English Grammar in Use* (5th Ed.) by Raymond Murphy:

- **Tenses** (simple, continuous, perfect, future) → Units 1–16, 19–25 + Appendices 2–3  
- **Conditionals & Wishes** → Units 38–41  
- **Passive Voice** → Units 42–46  
- **Relative Clauses & Reduced Clauses** → Units 92–97 (+ Unit 68 for –ing clauses)  
- **Subordinate (Complex) Clauses & Linking Adverbials** → Units 113–120  
- **Participial Phrases** → Units 68 & 97  

Units on **clefts, inversion** and **nominalisation** aren’t explicitly in Murphy’s intermediate-level text; you’ll need to practise those with supplementary materials.

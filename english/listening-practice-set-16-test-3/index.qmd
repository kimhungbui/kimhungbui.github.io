- **Result:** 10/10, no mistakes.
    
- **Strengths:** Careful with everyday details (colours, numbers, places). Excellent concentration.
    
- **What to Learn:** Trap signals like _“first… then… actually”_. Review singular/plural in daily items.
    

---

    - Distracted by fast speech and lost focus on key data.
        
    
- **Theme to Study:** Food, health, measurements (calorie, portion, intake, nutrients, balanced diet).
    
- **Key Learning:** Practice listening for **numbers + units** carefully (kcal, grams, percentages).
    

---

### **⚠️ Recording 4 – Hand Knitting**

- **Mistakes:** Q33 (_equipment_ not _equipments_), Q40 (_sheep_ not _sheeps_).
    
- **Problem Areas:** Grammar slips with uncountable nouns and irregular plurals.
    
- **Theme to Study:** History & crafts (garment, yarn, wool, technique, tradition).
    
- **Key Learning:** Revise common uncountable nouns + irregular plurals list.
    

---

# **📌 Overall Pattern Today**

- **Strengths:** You can follow lectures and everyday dialogues well. You catch main ideas and sequences.
    
- **Weaknesses:**
    
    1. **Plural vs singular forms** (equipments, sheeps).
        
    2. **Numbers & details** (nutrition test).
        
    3. **Traps with contrast** (job test).
        
    

---

# **🎯 Next Steps**

1. **Daily Grammar Fix:** Drill 10 uncountable nouns + 10 irregular plurals.
    
2. **Numbers Practice:** Do 5 “mini listening” clips where you only write down numbers/units.
    
3. **Trap Training:** Highlight _but, however, instead, rather than_ during practice and pause to predict the change.
    
4. **Vocabulary Notebook:** Split by IELTS themes (Work, Health, History, Daily Life). Add 5 new collocations each day.

## **🔎 Common IELTS traps in this passage**

| **Q**          | **Trap**                                                                                                                             | **Why it’s tricky**                                                                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 (park)       | They first mention “on the site here” → but then correct: “first they’re taken to the park.”                                         | IELTS loves “false starts” – you must wait for the correction.                         |
| 2 (blue)       | 3 different shirt colors: supervisors (red), instructors (blue), Jake (not mentioned directly).                                      | They try to confuse by layering details. Must focus only on the group in the question. |
| 3 (reference)  | Could sound like “qualification,” “certificate,” but it’s specifically a **reference** from someone who saw them work with children. | Vocabulary trap – must write exact word.                                               |
| 4 (story)      | Distractor: “quiet times” → options include story or game. Both mentioned, but question asks **one example** (story first).          | Need to notice which comes first.                                                      |
| 5 (rain)       | Some might expect “cancelled” → but they continue even in rain.                                                                      | Common sense trap: don’t assume.                                                       |
| 6 (snack)      | Woman asks about “a drink” → but Jake says drink is provided.                                                                        | This is a classic misdirection Q.                                                      |
| 7 (medication) | Easy to confuse with “snack” or “clothes.”                                                                                           | Need to follow parent’s concern carefully.                                             |
| 8 (helmet)     | Many kids bring clothes, shoes, etc. → but **helmet check** is the focus.                                                            | Detail listening needed.                                                               |
| 9 (tent)       | Could think “classroom” → but they say “meet up in the tent, you can’t miss it.”                                                     | Visual distraction trap.                                                               |
| 10 (199)       | They mention last year’s cost: 190 → then correct it to “199.”                                                                       | IELTS often compares “last year vs this year” to trick you.                            |


## **📘 What you should learn from this recording**

1. **Be careful with corrections & false starts**
    
    – IELTS speakers often say one thing, then correct or add new info. Always wait.
    
2. **Watch for distractors**
    
    – They throw in multiple items (red shirts vs blue shirts, snack vs drink, 190 vs 199).
    
    – You must match exactly to the question.
    
3. **Numbers are dangerous**
    
    – They like to mention a number, then another number → only the final one is correct.
    
4. **Exact wording matters**
    
    – “Reference” ≠ “certificate.” “Story” ≠ “game.” Always take the first correct match.
    
5. **IELTS loves practical detail**
    
    – Equipment, clothing, times, costs → everyday details are often tested.
    

---

👉 So, even though you got all correct, the _lesson_ here is:

- Don’t answer too quickly.
    
- Wait to see if the speaker **changes, corrects, or contrasts** the detail.
    
- When two possible answers appear, IELTS usually wants the **first one mentioned that matches the question**.

# Recording 2

### **❌ Q14 – Disadvantages of working outdoors**

- **Your answer:** A (the increasing risk of accidents)
    
- **Correct answer:** B + C (quiet/remote location + difficult weather)
    
- **Transcript clue:**
    
    > “It’s fine in summer, but can be extremely unpleasant when it’s cold and windy (weather). … But if you like a lively city environment … these jobs are probably not for you – they’re often in pretty remote areas (quiet location). … Standards of health and safety are much higher now … so fewer work-related accidents.”
    
- **Trap:** You picked “accidents” because it _looked logical_ with outdoor jobs. But the speaker explicitly said **accidents are fewer now**, so that eliminated A.
    

---

### **❌ Q17 – Fresh produce buyer**

- **Your answer:** E (chance to earn more through overtime)
    
- **Correct answer:** A (not a permanent job)
    
- **Transcript clue:**
    
    > “A leading supermarket is looking for a fresh produce buyer who is available for a **12-month maternity cover contract**.”
    
- **Trap:** “Competitive salary” misled you into thinking about money (E). But the **key detail** was “12-month maternity cover” = not permanent.
    

---

### **❌ Q19 – Tree technician**

- **Your answer:** G (accommodation available)
    
- **Correct answer:** C (experience not essential)
    
- **Transcript clue:**
    
    > “A year’s experience would be preferred but the company **might be prepared to consider someone who has just completed an appropriate training course**.”
    
- **Trap:** You overlooked the “experience not essential” phrase. Accommodation (G) appeared elsewhere (farm worker, Q20), so maybe you mis-assigned answers.
    
🔎 **Transcript line:**

  

> “A year’s experience would be preferred but the company **might be prepared to consider someone who has just completed an appropriate training course**.”

---

### **Why**  **“completed training course” ≠ experience**

- **Experience** = practical work done in real jobs (on-site, real tasks).
    
- **Training course** = education, not real-world job experience.
    
- The clue is in **contrast**:
    
    - “A year’s experience would be preferred” (real work)
        
    - “but… might consider training course” (no experience, only training).
        
    
- So IELTS wants you to hear that **experience is not essential**.
    

---

### **Why you thought it was experience**

- The word **“completed”** misleads. It _feels like_ you “did” something, which is close to work.
    
- But in IELTS logic: completing a course = **qualification**, not **experience**.
    

---

### **IELTS trick here**

  

They want to see if candidates can **distinguish between “preferred but not essential” vs. “required”**.

So the correct label = **C (experience not essential)**.
---

### **❌ Q20 – Farm worker**

- **Your answer:** B (involves leading a team)
    
- **Correct answer:** G (accommodation available)
    
- **Transcript clue:**
    
    > “Perks of the job include the **possibility of renting a small cottage on the estate**, and the chance to earn a competitive salary.”
    
- **Trap:** Maybe rushed here and confused it with “manager roles” that involve leading a team (B). The key signal word: “cottage on the estate” → accommodation.
    

I didn't know the cottage words i a small house, so i missed it.

small cottage on the estate

---

✅ **Pattern in your mistakes:**

1. You sometimes **default to common-sense answers** (e.g. accidents, money, leadership) instead of anchoring to the transcript.
    
2. You may **misplace answers** — using a keyword from one job (farm worker) and applying it to another (tree technician).
    
3. You sometimes **stop listening after the first clue** (“competitive salary”) instead of listening for the whole detail.
    

---

👉 Suggestion for next time:

- Always **underline the unique job detail**: maternity cover = not permanent, cottage = accommodation.
    
- For disadvantages/advantages, **watch for contrasts** (e.g. “health and safety are much higher now” kills option A).
    
- Use **process of elimination** — ask yourself: “Did she actually say this, or am I assuming?”
# Recording 3

## **Why your Q26 was wrong**

  

**Question type:** “What do the students _agree_ about…?”

You must hear **both speakers** endorse the same idea.

  

## **What the audio actually says**

- **Rosie:** “…calorie counts… are sometimes really **confusing** and I suspect they do it **on purpose**.”
    
- **Adam:** “**Yeah**…” (clear agreement)
    

  

→ Paraphrase: **manufacturers deliberately make calorie counts hard to understand.**

✅ Correct: **A**

  

## **Why B & C are wrong**

- **B. fail to provide accurate calorie counts**
    
    No one says the numbers are **inaccurate**—only **confusing** (clarity ≠ accuracy).
    
- **C. use ineffective methods to reduce calories**
    
    They don’t talk about manufacturers **reducing** calories at all—only **labelling**.
    

  

## **Signal words to lock it in next time**

- **Deliberately** = _on purpose, intentionally_
    
- **Hard to understand** = _confusing, unclear, not straightforward_
    
- **Agreement cues**: “yeah”, “exactly”, “right”, “I know”, “that’s true”.
    

  

## **Mini tip**

  

When a “**agree**” question appears:

1. Find the **claim** (Rosie).
    
2. Wait for **explicit uptake** (Adam’s “Yeah/Exactly/Right”).
    
3. Match to the **closest paraphrase**; avoid options introducing **new ideas** (accuracy / calorie reduction).

## **🎯 IELTS Listening Traps in Recording 3**

---

## **🧪 Experiments & Research**

- **Trap (Q21–22)**:
    
    - Adam: _“It was hard to keep track… I had so many people… had to make sure I kept a proper record”_
        
    - The distractor = “simple to set up” (B) → ❌ BUT he said it was _hard_.
        
    - Correct answers = **C (large sample)** + **D (subjects unaware)**.
        
    

  

🔑 **Tip**: If speaker says _“hard / difficult”_, never choose “easy / simple”.

---

- **Trap (Q23–24)**:
    
    - Rosie: _“results problematic… seemed lower than package… probably I didn’t grind enough… scales not accurate enough.”_
        
    - Distractor = “package info was incorrect” → ❌ She rejects that idea (“I reckon package info was right”).
        
    - Correct = **C (not grind finely enough)** + **E (scales unsuitable)**.
        
    

  

🔑 **Tip**: Watch for phrases like _“I think probably / I suspect / but actually I believe”_ → these show what the **real answer is**, not the first statement.

---

## **🍔 Obesity & Nutrition**

- **Trap (Q26)**:
    
    - Rosie: _“labels sometimes really confusing… I suspect they do it on purpose.”_
        
    - Correct = **A (make calorie counts hard to understand)**.
        
    - Distractors:
        
        - “fail to provide accurate counts” ❌ (she never said they were false, just confusing).
            
        - “use ineffective methods to reduce calories” ❌ (not mentioned).
            
        
    

  

🔑 **Tip**: Confusing ≠ inaccurate. IELTS loves this distinction.

---

- **Trap (Q25)**:
    
    - Adam: _“Items at start/end of menu more likely to be chosen → put low-calorie items there → people will go for them.”_
        
    - Correct = **C (organised in a particular way)**.
        
    - Distractors: “fewer options” (not said), “more low-calorie foods” (not said).
        
    

  

🔑 **Tip**: When they talk about _positioning / structure / arrangement_, the answer is about **organisation**, not quantity.

---

## **🏃 Exercise & Health**

- **Trap (Q27)**:
    
    - Rosie: _“40% men say they do… but actually only 6% do. 30% women say… only 4% do.”_
        
    - Correct = **B (Most people overestimate how much they do)**.
        
    - Distractor = “recommended too low” ❌ (she never said that).
        
    - Distractor = “women now exercise more” ❌ (not mentioned).
        
    

  

🔑 **Tip**: Look for contrast markers (_“say… but actually”_). The real answer is always after the contrast.

---

- **Trap (Q29)**:
    
    - Adam: _“Not sure if we should include exercise… our tutor said focus on nutrition… that will be simpler.”_
        
    - Correct = **A (probably leave it out)**.
        
    - Distractors:
        
        - “need to do more research” ❌ (they didn’t say they lacked research).
            
        - “should discuss with tutor” ❌ (they didn’t mention asking tutor again).
            
        
    

  

🔑 **Tip**: When they conclude “that will be simpler,” it means **decision is made**.

---

✅ So your main mistakes (Q26 earlier) happened because:

- You mixed up _confusing_ vs _inaccurate_.
    
- You trusted the **first idea mentioned**, but IELTS hides the answer in the **clarification or contrast**.
# Recording 4

## **❌ Q33 – “People are buying more (33) ……… for knitting nowadays.”**

- You wrote: **equipments**
    
- Correct answer: **equipment**
    

  

📌 Why?

- In English, **“equipment” is uncountable** → ❌ no plural “equipments.”
    
- The speaker said: _“…we’re also seeing an increase in the sales figures for knitting_ **_equipment_**_.”_
    
- IELTS listening tests your **grammar awareness**: even if you hear “equipmentS” in your head, you must know the correct word form.
    

  

👉 **Trap**: They test if you know that some nouns don’t take “s” (e.g. furniture, information, advice, luggage, equipment).

  

**How to avoid next time:**

- If you hear a word that could be uncountable, write it in singular form unless you are 100% sure plural is correct.
    

---

## **❌ Q40 – “Everyday tasks like looking after (40) ……… were done while knitting.”**

- You wrote: **sheeps**
    
- Correct answer: **sheep**
    

  

📌 Why?

- “Sheep” is **irregular plural** → both singular & plural form is the same.
    
- The speaker said: _“…men, women and children took every opportunity to knit, for example, while watching over_ **_sheep_**_.”_
    
- IELTS loves to check if you know irregular plurals (sheep, deer, fish, species, etc.).
    

  

👉 **Trap**: You heard the plural idea (many sheep), so you added **s** by instinct. But the rule is: **no “s” for sheep** in plural.

  

**How to avoid next time:**

- Revise **irregular plurals**: sheep, deer, fish, series, species, offspring, aircraft.
    
- When in doubt, trust grammar rules — IELTS will never break them.
    

---

✅ So both mistakes were not about **listening** but about **word form & grammar**.

- Q33 = uncountable noun rule.
    
- Q40 = irregular plural rule.

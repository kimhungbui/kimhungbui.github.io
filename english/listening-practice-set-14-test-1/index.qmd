# Recording 1

| Question | My answer | Corrected | ISSUE                             |
| -------- | --------- | --------- | --------------------------------- |
| 9        | BLONE     | BLOND(E)  | __Spelling mistake__ / Mishearing |
Likely a **phonetic error** — I heard the pronunciation correctly but guessed the wrong spelling.

- **“Blond(e)”** refers to **hair color** and is commonly used in listening tasks that describe people’s **appearance**.
    
- **BLOND** = traditionally used for **males**
    
- **BLONDE** = traditionally used for **females**
    
- In IELTS, **both are accepted**, so it's often written as **“BLOND(E)”**.

| 11       | E enjoy new challenges          | E - enjoy new challenges   | ❌ **Misinterpretation** – The speaker mentions challenges but doesn’t advise “enjoying” them. No advice to enjoy anything was given. |
| 12       | A get to know colleagues        | A -                        | ✅ **Correct** – The speaker explicitly says to talk to people and make new friends.                                                  |
| 17       | B - There are some restrictions | C - it is against the rule |                                                                                                                                      |
I miss the word: 'check with someone ...'

### **Correct Option A: get to know colleagues**

> **“make an effort to talk to as many people as possible about their work – you'll make some new friends and find out lots of useful information.”**

That clearly advises you to **talk to people** and **make friends** → This is **getting to know colleagues**.

---

### ✅ **Correct Option C: ask lots of questions**

> **“check with someone if you're not sure what to do – your supervisor is approachable and won’t mind explaining things”**

That is clear advice to **ask questions** if unsure. So, C is correct.

### ❌ **Why Option E (enjoy new challenges) is wrong**

You chose:

> **E: enjoy new challenges**

This sounds like good advice, but it **wasn’t actually said**.

Here’s the relevant part:

> **“Most of you have very little or no experience... and the first week may be quite challenging...”**

She **acknowledges** that it may be challenging — but she **never says** “Enjoy it!” or “embrace challenges.” She actually says:

> **“Don't worry too much... check with someone...”**

So she's saying the first week may be hard, but she’s not giving the **advice** to _enjoy_ the challenge. So **E is an interpretation**, **not actual advice**.
- Only choose answers that are **directly supported by the exact wording** in the audio.
    
- Do **not infer advice** unless the speaker clearly gives it as advice.
    
- Watch out for choices that are **logically good** but **not actually said**.

Q17: _Booking Holidays_

"... we ask that you __don't book any holidays until after your six-month apprenticeship has finished__. Time off should only be taken if you are unwell."

### ✅ Correct Answer: **C – It is against the rules**

#### Why?

- The manager clearly **asks apprentices NOT to book any holidays during the six-month apprenticeship.**
    
- The only exception is **sick leave**.
    
- This isn’t just a “restriction” — it’s a **firm rule** for everyone during that time.
    

---

### ❌ Why your answer B (There are some restrictions) is incorrect:

- “Restrictions” would imply **some flexibility** — that holidays are **allowed but with limits.**
    
- But in this case, **they are not allowed at all**, unless you're sick.

### 🔁 Re-examining the line:

> “...**we ask that you don't book any holidays until after your six-month apprenticeship has finished**. Time off should only be taken if you are unwell.”

---

### 🔍 Your logic:

> Since holidays are possible **after** 6 months, that feels like a _restriction_, not a full ban. So maybe it's **B**?

Totally understandable — **but here’s the key** in IELTS logic:

---

### ❗ In IELTS, **questions refer only to the time period given** — in this case:

> **“Company policy for apprentices”**

So, the phrase **“Booking holidays”** in this question is specifically asking about **during the apprenticeship** (i.e., the 6 months).

---

### So the manager’s meaning is:

> ❌ No holidays are allowed **at all** during your apprenticeship.  
> ✅ Only if you are **unwell** can you take time off.

That’s a **ban during the apprenticeship** — not a restriction, but a **prohibition**. Therefore:

---

### ✅ Correct = **C (It is against the rules)**

Because:

- Booking holidays during the apprenticeship = not allowed.
    
- After the apprenticeship = irrelevant to the question.
    

---

### 🔑 IELTS Tip:

Always consider:

> “Does the question refer to now, or after a period?”  
> If the policy is **temporarily prohibited**, that’s still **“against the rules”** for the period in question.


# Recording 3

### ✅ Correct Answer: **A. may bring pollution to the cities**

### ❌ Your Answer: **B. may reduce the land available for agriculture**

---

### 📌 Let’s break it down:

#### 🔈 What Rob actually says:

> "Agriculture and industry tend to spread further inland along the rivers... and so agriculture moves even further inland... **more and more pollutants are discharged into the rivers**."
> 
> "So these are **brought downstream to the cities**?"

#### 🔍 What does this mean?

- As **agriculture and industry expand**, they pollute the river.
    
- That **pollution flows downstream** (with the river) **to the coastal cities**.
    
- 💡 That’s **pollution reaching cities**, not a lack of agricultural land.
    

---

### ❗ Why is **B** wrong?

You chose:

> **B. may reduce the land available for agriculture**

But:

- Rob never says that **land for agriculture is reduced**.
    
- He says **agriculture is spreading further** — not less, but more.
    
- The **problem is pollution**, not land use.
    

---

### 🧠 IELTS Listening Tip:

Always ask: **"What is the problem?"**

- If the speaker says **“a problem”**, that’s a **clue**.
    
- In this case: **"pollutants are discharged into rivers → brought to cities"**.
    

---

### 🗣 Practice Paraphrasing:

Try paraphrasing the key point yourself:

> _"Pollution from inland farming and industry flows down rivers into coastal cities."_

That’s what **Answer A** says!

# Recording 4

### 🔎 Let’s examine your answer:

- **Your answer:** `gate`
    
- **Correct answer:** `gates`
    

I don't hear clearly gate or gates, but I miss the word 'are', so it's the mistake.

---

### 📍 What did the speaker say?

> “**Gates** in the breakwater ___are___ opened.”

This is clearly **plural** — they said **“gates”**, not just **“a gate.”**

---

### 🧠 Why it matters:

In IELTS Listening:

- If the word is **plural** in the recording, and you write the **singular form**, it's **marked wrong**.
    
- Even one letter like **“s”** matters!
    

---

### ✅ How to avoid this mistake:

1. **Listen carefully for plural endings** like **"s", "z", "es", "en"** (e.g. _children_).
    
2. Look for **clues in the sentence**:
    
    - “Gates **are** opened” → plural verb = plural subject.
        

---

### 🔁 Quick Grammar Check:

- ❌ _Gate are opened_ → wrong
    
- ✅ _Gates are opened_ → correct ✅
    

---

### 💡 IELTS Tip:

When checking your answers before transferring, always:

- Go back and check **singular/plural**
    
- Re-listen if possible and confirm articles like _a/an_ or _some_, which hint at number

|Type|Question|Wrong Answer|Correct Answer|Why You Missed It|Vocabulary/Structure|

## 🎧 **Effective Listening Practice Process (Full-Skill Integration)**

### ✅ 1. **Take 2 Listening Tests per Week (Full 40 Questions)**

- Simulate real exam conditions (headphones, timing).
    
- Use **Cambridge IELTS books 10–18** for authentic practice.
    
- After finishing, **log your mistakes**, and do a **deep error analysis**.
    

### 📝 2. **Error Log Analysis System**

For every mistake (even close ones), record:

|Type|Question|Wrong Answer|Correct Answer|Why You Missed It|Vocabulary/Structure|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

This helps improve:

- Vocabulary
    
- Grammar
    
- Distractor recognition (very important)
    
- Paraphrasing skills for Reading and Writing
    

---

## 🔄 3. **Shadowing & Dictation (Listening → Speaking & Writing)**

Do this with 1 test per week (after checking answers).

### Step-by-step:

1. **Dictation** – write down the full recording transcript for 1 section.
    
2. **Underline synonyms/paraphrased phrases**.
    
3. **Shadow** (repeat aloud with same intonation and rhythm).
    
4. **Summarize the section** in your own words.
    
5. **Record yourself** and evaluate fluency & coherence (like Speaking Part 3).
    

✅ This improves:

- **Listening accuracy**
    
- **Speaking fluency**
    
- **Lexical resource** & complex sentence structure (Writing & Speaking)
    

---

## 📚 4. **Create Vocabulary Banks from Listening**

Each test contains **academic + conversational vocabulary**. Create a table:

|Word/Phrase|Meaning|Example from Listening|My Own Sentence|
|---|---|---|---|
|Subsidised|Supported financially|"A heavily subsidised canteen"|My workplace provides subsidised meals.|

✅ Apply these to Writing & Speaking tasks.

---

## 💬 5. **Write & Speak from Listening Topics**

Take themes from Listening (e.g. environment, education, employment):

- **Write** a Task 2 essay on a related question.
    
- **Practice** a Speaking Part 2 & 3 answer on the same topic.
    

This builds content **cohesion between skills**, which is how top scorers learn faster.

Use a different grammatical structure. Some useful examples of this are: changing a verb to a

noun; changing from active to passive; changing the focus of a sentence e.g. by making the object

of the sentence into the subject; or by beginning with the final idea. Look at the grammatical

changes I needed to make just by reversing the ideas in this sentence and changing the verb ‘to study’ into a noun:

- It is better to study overseas than in your home town .

- Studying in your home town has fewer advantages than studying overseas.


1 Although celebrities have problems, there are plenty of advantages to being famous.

-> Despite the benefits that fame brings, celebrities still have their problems.

# Independent Clause & Subordinate Clause

A __clause__ Ã­ a word group that contains a subject and a verb. If that clause can stand alone-in other words, if that clause is the same as a sentence-we call it an ___independent clause___.

__independent clause__: She __held__ the scale

__subordinate clause__: as she __held__ the scale

::: {.callout-note}
When we say that a clause is _subordinate_, we are not referring to its importance, but simply to its grammatical dependence on the independent clause.
:::

A complex sentence is a _sentence that contains at least one subordinate clause_.

Subordinate clauses can be divided into three categories based on their function:
- adjective clauses
- adverb clauses
- noun clauses

Example:
- Independent clause/sentence: _They_ __got__ into a station wagon. (has a subject and verb and can stand alone).
- Subordinate clause/adverb: As _they_ __got__ into a station wagon. (has a subject and verb but cannot stand alone).
- subordinate clause/adjective: _Which_ __was__ a station wagon. (has a subject and verb but cannot stand alone)
- subordinate clause/noun: That _they_ __got__ into a station wagon.

Example:
1. A single sword is held aloft. (independent)
2. After you left me. (subordinate)
3. Because my uncle sat at the stone table. (subordinate)
4. That a serpentine hair bangs over one ear. (subordinate)
5. Which is a hidden pleasure. (subordinate)
6. Who knew the rules and punishments. (subordinate)
7. Why she chose to wear the hex on her forehead. (subordinate)
8. You lose yourself in the cave of endless breath. (independent)

# Subordinating Conjunctions

An __adverbial subordinate clause__ begins with a __subordinating conjunction__.
That list:
- after, as if, as long as, as soon as, although, as, as if, because, before, even if, if, since, so that, though, till, unless, when, whenever, wherever, while.

Let's take a complete sentence, add a word to that complete sentence, and get less than a complete sentence.

- start with a complete sentence: _the sunset behind Lake Tahoe is spectacular_
- add a word: _although_
- get less than a complete sentence: _although the sunset behind lake Tahoe is spectacular_

This is how adverb clauses are created.

- a subordinating conjunction + a sentence = an adverb clause
- _although_ + _the sunset behind Lake Tahoe is spectacular_ = an adverb clause

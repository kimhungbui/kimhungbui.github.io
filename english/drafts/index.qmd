Correct sentence:
The table illustrates car production figures for three major manufacturers between 2010 and 2015.

- We cannot say ~~cars production~~, cars is a plural noun, and here it should modify "production", but only singular noun modifiers work properly in this structure.
  The correct noun phrase is: "car production figures" (not cars)
- The preposition "by" is slightly awkward when use with "figures". We use figures with "for".

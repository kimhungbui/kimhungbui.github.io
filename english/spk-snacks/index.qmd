__Topic:__ snacks

__Themes:__ Diet, health, lifestyle, habits

__Personal / Local__:
Present:
These days, I usually snack on roasted peanuts or fruit because they're healthier, but when I feel stressed with studying, I can't resist ice cream with my girlfriend. I don't eat any fast food or have sugary drinks at all.

Habits / preferences / like / dislikes:

I love chocolate, but I mostly eat dark chocolate because it has less sugar. If I do snacks, I have something protein-based or vegetable.

Past:

I used to snack a lot when I was working – especially in the afternoons. Back then, I could eat whatever I wanted without putting on weight, but eventually, it caught up with me and I gained weight, so I stopped.

Near future:

I don’t plan to change my current snack habits, but I know many people will still consume too much sugar to get a quick energy boost.

__Key memories:__

I associate that snack with my time spent with my girlfriend, sometimes we buy groceries in the supermarket and eat ice cream or French fries together.

When I was in high school, I often stayed up late playing computer games with friends. We always had chips and soda beside us, and at that time, I didn’t really care about health. Now when I see that brand of chips, it reminds me of those nights.

*Wholefoods are foods that are not processed and are more natural; *well-rounded' is often used to talk about experience or education that includes a very wide range of different areas. With food, we usually talk about having 'a balanced diet' though well-rounded can be used too, meaning a diet that includes a wide range of foods.

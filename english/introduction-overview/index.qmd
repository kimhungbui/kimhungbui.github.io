## Rewrite Introduction
### Rewrite
_The table shows how many hours people of different age use internet for fun and for work each week._
My answer:
The table illustrates the number of hours people of various ages use the internet for leisure and for professional each week.

|Issue|Explanation|Correction|
|---|---|---|
|**“for professional”**|“Professional” is an adjective. You need a **noun** here.|Use **“for work”** or **“for professional purposes”**|
|**“people of various ages”**|Good, but can be made more natural.|Try **“people in different age groups”**|
|**“use the internet”**|Fine, but could be made more academic.|Try **“spend online”** or **“use the internet for…”**|
|**Word order**|Ending on "each week" is okay, but it reads better earlier.|Rearrange for fluency.|
Better:
	The table illustrates the number of hours per week that people in different age groups spend online for leisure and work-related activities.
Or:
	The table provides data on the weekly hours spent online by people of various age group, categorized by leisure and professional purposes.

Rewrite:
	The bar chart shows the percentage of households in four different income levels that had internet access in 2010 and 2020.
I write:
	The bar chart illustrates the distribution of households in four various income levels that had internet access in 2010 and 2020.

|Issue|Correction|
|---|---|
|**“four various”**|❌ Redundant. Use either "four" or "various" — not both. → ✅ “four different” or just “four”|
|**“distribution of households”**|✅ Okay, but could be clearer — this chart shows **percentages**, not the count or physical distribution. Try **“percentage of households”**|
|**Grammar and flow**|Sentence is understandable but can be more formal and concise|
Better:
	The bar chart illustrates the percentage of households across four income levels that had access to the internet in 2010 and 2020.
Or:
	The bar chart compares the proportion of households with internet access in four income groups for the years 2010 and 2020.

### Rewrite
_The line graph shows the number of international students enrolled in Canadian universities between 2005 and 2020, broken down by region of origin._

The line graph illustrates how many international students enrolled in Canadian universities between 2005 and 2020, categorize by area of origin.

|Issue|Explanation|Correction|
|---|---|---|
|**“how many international students”**|Okay, but more formal: **“the number of international students”**||
|**“categorize”**|❌ Wrong form → should be **“categorized”** (past participle in passive structure)||
|**“area of origin”**|Acceptable, but **“region of origin”** or **“by region”** is more common in academic writing||
|**Flow**|Combine ideas more smoothly with a formal tone||

Better:
	The line graph illustrates the number of international students enrolled in Canadian universities from 2005 to 2020, categorized by region of origin.
Or:
	The line graph presents data on international student enrollment in Canadian universities over a 15-year period, broken down by region of origin.

### Rewrite
_The pie charts show the proportion of energy produced from five different sources in a European country in 1980 and 2020._
I write:
	The pie charts illustrate the percentage of energy made from five different sources in a European country in 1980 and 2020.

|Issue|Explanation|Fix|
|---|---|---|
|**“energy made from”**|❌ Informal/awkward for Task 1. Use **"produced from"** or **"generated by"**||
|**“in a European country”**|✅ This is fine and accurate||
|**“five different sources”**|✅ Good — “five sources” is enough, but "different" is okay for emphasis||
Better:
	The pie charts illustrate the proportion of energy generated from five sources in a European country in the years 1980 and 2020.
Or:
	The two pie charts compare the share of energy production by five distinct sources in a European country in 1980 and 2020.

### Rewrite

| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| **"illustrates"**             | ✅ Good verb for visuals                                                                           |               |
| **"the salary"**              | ❌ Slightly vague → “salary” is better expressed as **“average monthly income”** to match the task |               |
| **"three different sectors"** | ✅ Fine, though "various sectors" or “economic sectors” may be more formal                         |               |
| **"in five countries"**       | ✅ Good — you could also say **“across five countries”** for variety                               |               |
Better:
	The table illustrates the average monthly income of workers __across three sectors__ in five different countries.

I write:
	The line graph illustrates the proportion of the people who over 65 and over in Japan, Sweden, and the US between 1940 and 2040.

|Issue|Explanation|Fix|
|---|---|---|
|**“the people who over 65 and over”**|❌ Grammar mistake. You need: “people **aged 65 and over**”||
|**“the proportion of the people”**|❌ Too wordy. Use **“the proportion of people”** (no “the” before “people”)||
|**“US” vs “USA”**|✅ Both are fine. Choose one and stay consistent||
|**“between 1940 and 2040”**|✅ Correct and clear||
Better:
	The line graph illustrates the proportion of people aged 65 and over in Japan, Sweden, and the USA between 1940 and 2040.
Or:
	The line graph compares the percentage of the population aged 65 and above in Japan, Sweden, and the United States from 1940 to 2040.

I write overview:

While the number of USA senior citizen is slightly increase in throughout the period, that figure of Sweden and Japan are reduce on that time.

|Issue|Explanation|Correction|
|---|---|---|
|**“number of USA senior citizen”**|❌ Wrong form: should be **“percentage of senior citizens in the USA”**||
|**“is slightly increase”**|❌ Incorrect verb form: should be **“increases slightly”**||
|**“are reduce”**|❌ Incorrect verb form again: should be **“decline”**, but actually this is **factually wrong**||
|**Trend accuracy**|❌ In fact, Japan and Sweden both **increase overall**, not decrease||

Better:
	Overall, the proportion of elderly people increased in all three countries throughout the period, with Japan showing the most dramatic growth after 2020.
Or:
	In general, all three countries experienced a rise in the percentage of people aged 65 and above, with Japan's elderly population rising sharply after 2020.

Better:

- **Avoid exact figures**

| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **"who spend time"**              | Slightly vague — use more formal and precise phrasing | “who visited” or “who traveled to”                                       |
| **“in 4 seasons”**                | Informal and unclear                                  | “across the four seasons” or “during spring, summer, autumn, and winter” |
| **“two end seasons of the year”** | Unnatural phrasing                                    | Use: “in winter and autumn” or “in the colder seasons”                   |
| **“tourist trend”**               | Vague expression                                      | Use: “a peak in tourist numbers” or “more visitors”                      |

## 🔹 **Suggestions to Improve:**

1. Work on grammatical accuracy—especially **articles**, **plural nouns**, and **verb forms**.
    
2. Use more precise academic phrases:
    
    - Instead of: “soared up to 60%” → say “rose significantly to 60%”
        
    - Instead of: “with already high percentage internet access” → “already had a high level of internet access”
        
3. Vary your linking phrases:
    
    - “In comparison”
        
    - “Similarly”
        
    - “By contrast”
        
    - “Over the period”

Better:
The table illustrates the percentage of households with internet access across the income groups-low, middle, and high-in a European country from 2005 to 2020.

Overall, internet access increased in all income categories over the 15-year period. However, households in the high-income group consistently had the highest access, while low-income households remained significantly behind.

In 2005, 80% of high-income households had internet access, compared to 35% of middle-income and only 5% of low-income households. By 2010, these figures rose to 92%, 55%, and 15% respectively, with the gap between groups still substantial.

The most notable growth occurred between 2010 and 2020. High-income households saw a steady rise, reaching 99% by the end of the period. Middle-income homes increased from 55% to 82%, while the low-income group experienced the most dramatic rise-from just 15% in 2010 to 45% in 2020. Despite this improvement, internet access remained significantly lower for the lowest income group.

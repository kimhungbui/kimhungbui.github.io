_The pie charts below show enrollment in different fields of study at a particular university._

_Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant._

The two pie charts illustrate the percentage of male and female students enrolled in four academic fields - Social Sciences, Humanities, Education, and Engineering - at Clydesdale University.
Overall, male students showed a strong preference for Engineering, while female students were more inclined toward Humanities and education. Social science was the only field with relatively balanced participation between genders.

Engineering was the dominant choices for male students, comprising 45% of their total enrollment, more than twice the proportion of females in the same field (20%). In constrast, only 10% of men chose Humanities, while this subject attracted 30% of women - three times higher. Similarly, Education accounted for 35% of female enrollment, compared to just 20% for men.

The only discipline where the gender gap was moderate was Social Sciences. While a quarter of men were enrolled in this field, women followed closely behind at 15%. Although a difference exists, this subject showed the least contrast in gender representation.

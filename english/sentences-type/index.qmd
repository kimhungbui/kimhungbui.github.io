In **IELTS Writing Task 1 (Academic)**, using a **range of sentence types** is crucial for achieving a **Band 7 or higher** in **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**.

Here's a list of **sentence types you should use**, with **examples** tailored to data description:

# Simple Sentences
Used to state clear facts.
- Structure: Subject + verb + object
- Example:
	- Internet access rose in all income groups.

# Compound Sentences
Connect two related ideas using coordinating conjunctions (and, but, or, so, yet).
- Structure: Independent clause + conjunction + independent clause.
- Example:
	- Low-income households saw growth, but they remained behind other groups.

# Complex Sentences
Used to show relationships such as cause, contrast, or time.
- Structure: Independent clause + dependent clause (or vice versa)
- Examples:
	- Although the figures increased, the gap between groups remained wide.
	- As time progressed, internet access became more common.

# Passive Voice
Useful for focusing on what happened rather than who did it (common in process/task descriptions).
- Example:
	- A steady increase was observed in all three income categories.
# Comparative Sentences
Used to highlight differences or similarities.
- Example:
	- The high-income group had nearly twice the access as the middle-income group in 2005.
	- Internet usage in low-income households was much lower than in the other two groups.
# Superlative Sentences
Used to emphasize the highest or lowest point in the data.
- Example:
	- The high-income group had the highest internet access throughout the period.
	- The smallest increase was seen in the middle-income group between 2015 and 2020.
# Trend Description Sentences
Used to describe change over time.
- Examples:
	- The figure rose steadily from 35% to 82%.
	- There was a sharp increase in internet access between 2010 and 2015.

# Quantifying and Grouping Sentences
Useful when describing portions of categories.
- Examples:
	- Over half of the middle-income households had internet access by 2015.
	- Only a small fraction of low-income households were online in 2005.

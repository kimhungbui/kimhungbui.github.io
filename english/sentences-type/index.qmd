In **IELTS Writing Task 1 (Academic)**, using a **range of sentence types** is crucial for achieving a **Band 7 or higher** in **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**.

Here's a list of **sentence types you should use**, with **examples** tailored to data description:

# Kinds of sentences according to structure
## Simple Sentences
Used to state clear facts. 
Simple Sentences have one subject and one finite verb.

- Structure: Subject + verb + object
- Example:
	- Internet access rose in all income groups.

## Compound Sentences
Connect two related ideas using coordinating conjunctions (and, but, or, so, yet).
When two independent clauses are joined by __for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so__ (FANBOYS), we __must use a comma__ before the conjunction. Those clauses can be connected by a semicolon (;)

- Structure: Independent clause + conjunction + independent clause.
- Example:
	- She told a folk tale, __and__ we all listened to her.
	- He does not speak our language, yet see seems to understand what we say.
	- Low-income households saw growth, but they remained behind other groups.
	- We moved to Florida in 1978; we stayed only five years __and__ then returned to Ohio.

Compound sentences can be reduced by removing the subject and verb in the second clause if they are the same as in the first clause.

- We ask him now or (we) wait until tomorrow.
- He is sitting and (he is) listening to me.

## Complex Sentences
Used to show relationships such as cause, contrast, or time.
A complex sentence is made up of:
- One independent clause (main clause)
- One or more dependent clauses (subordinate clauses)

The main clause can stand alone as a complete sentence.

The subordinate clause cannot stand alone-it depends on the main clause to complete its meaning.

Structure:

[Main Clause] + [Subordinate Clause]

OR

[Subordinate Clause], [Main Clause]

- Examples:
	- Because she was tired, she went to bed early.
		- "she went to bed early" = main clause
		- "Because she was tired" = subordinate clause (reason)
	- I stayed at home __although__ it was sunny.
		- "I stay at home" = main clause
		- "although it was sunny" = subordinate clause (contrast)
	- When the movie ended, we left the cinema
		- "we left the cinema" = main clause
		- "When the movie ended" = subordinate clause (time)
	- Although the figures increased, the gap between groups remained wide.
	- As time progressed, internet access became more common.

### Type of Subordinate Clauses
|**Type**|**Function**|**Example**|
|---|---|---|
|Adverbial|Shows time, reason, condition…|_If it rains_, we’ll cancel the picnic.|
|Adjective|Modifies a noun|The book _that you gave me_ is interesting.|
|Noun|Acts as a subject/object|_What he said_ surprised everyone.|
### Common Subordinating Conjunctions
| **Type**  | **Examples**                      |
| --------- | --------------------------------- |
| Time      | when, while, after, before, until |
| Reason    | because, since, as                |
| Condition | if, unless, provided that         |
| Contrast  | although, even though, whereas    |
| Purpose   | so that, in order that            |

::: {.callout-tip} 
## Using comma
 - Use a __comma__ if the subordinate clause comes first.
 	- _Although it was late_, they continued working
- No comma if the main clause comes first:
	- They continued working _although it was late
:::


## Complex- Compound Sentences

# Passive Voice
Useful for focusing on what happened rather than who did it (common in process/task descriptions).

- Example:
	- A steady increase was observed in all three income categories.
# Comparative Sentences
Used to highlight differences or similarities.

- Example:
	- The high-income group had nearly twice the access as the middle-income group in 2005.
	- Internet usage in low-income households was much lower than in the other two groups.
# Superlative Sentences
Used to emphasize the highest or lowest point in the data.

- Example:
	- The high-income group had the highest internet access throughout the period.
	- The smallest increase was seen in the middle-income group between 2015 and 2020.
# Trend Description Sentences
Used to describe change over time.

- Examples:
	- The figure rose steadily from 35% to 82%.
	- There was a sharp increase in internet access between 2010 and 2015.

# Quantifying and Grouping Sentences
Useful when describing portions of categories.

- Examples:
	- Over half of the middle-income households had internet access by 2015.
	- Only a small fraction of low-income households were online in 2005.

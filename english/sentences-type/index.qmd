In **IELTS Writing Task 1 (Academic)**, using a **range of sentence types** is crucial for achieving a **Band 7 or higher** in **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**.

Here's a list of **sentence types you should use**, with **examples** tailored to data description:

# Simple Sentences
Used to state clear facts. 
Simple Sentences have one subject and one finite verb.
- Structure: Subject + verb + object
- Example:
	- Internet access rose in all income groups.

# Compound Sentences
Connect two related ideas using coordinating conjunctions (and, but, or, so, yet).
When two independent clauses are joined by __for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so__ (FANBOYS), we __must use a comma__ before the conjunction. Those clauses can be connected by a semi-colon (;)
- Structure: Independent clause + conjunction + independent clause.
- Example:
	- She told a folk tale, __and__ we all listened to her.
	- He does not speak our language, yet see seems to understand what we say.
	- Low-income households saw growth, but they remained behind other groups.
	- We moved to Florida in 1978; we stayed only five years __and__ then returned to Ohio.

Compound sentences can be reduced by removing the subject and verb in the second clause if they are the same as in the first clause.
	 We ask him now or (we) wait until tomorrow.
	 He is sitting and (he is) listening to me.

# Complex Sentences
Used to show relationships such as cause, contrast, or time.
- Structure: Independent clause + dependent clause (or vice versa)
- Examples:
	- Although the figures increased, the gap between groups remained wide.
	- As time progressed, internet access became more common.

# Passive Voice
Useful for focusing on what happened rather than who did it (common in process/task descriptions).
- Example:
	- A steady increase was observed in all three income categories.
# Comparative Sentences
Used to highlight differences or similarities.
- Example:
	- The high-income group had nearly twice the access as the middle-income group in 2005.
	- Internet usage in low-income households was much lower than in the other two groups.
# Superlative Sentences
Used to emphasize the highest or lowest point in the data.
- Example:
	- The high-income group had the highest internet access throughout the period.
	- The smallest increase was seen in the middle-income group between 2015 and 2020.
# Trend Description Sentences
Used to describe change over time.
- Examples:
	- The figure rose steadily from 35% to 82%.
	- There was a sharp increase in internet access between 2010 and 2015.

# Quantifying and Grouping Sentences
Useful when describing portions of categories.
- Examples:
	- Over half of the middle-income households had internet access by 2015.
	- Only a small fraction of low-income households were online in 2005.

## **What happened on Q6 (“clouds”)**

- **Audio said:** “_The instructions were to_ **_capture the clouds_** _as well — it couldn’t just be blue sky and a setting sun._”
    
- **Table prompt:** “_Scene must show some _______”
    
- **Grammar clue:** “**some**” + **countable noun** → plural form. If it were singular, it would be **“a cloud”**; with “some,” it must be **“clouds.”**
    
- **Why it’s easy to miss:** The final **/z/** in “clouds” is short and can be swallowed in natural speech, especially before a consonant. Under time pressure, it’s common to write the base form.
    

  

## **How to avoid this mistake next time**

1. **Use the prompt grammar:** When you see **“some ___,”** pre-decide it will be **plural** (or an uncountable noun). For sunsets, the natural collocation is **“some clouds.”**
    
2. **Listen for plural cues in the audio:**
    
    - Determiner: **“some”**
        
    - Verb agreement: **“were”** (if used)
        
    - Pronouns: **“they/them”** referring back
        
    
3. **Mark a quick “S?” in the margin** when you spot “some/many/few/these/those.” Confirm during the replay/check window.
    
4. **Pre-activate likely vocabulary:** For “sunsets,” anticipate **clouds / cloud cover / horizon / silhouettes**. When you expect “clouds,” you’re more likely to catch the plural.
    
5. **Micro-listening practice:** Train your ear for final consonant clusters **/dz/** (e.g., **clouds, birds, roads**). Say them aloud to feel the plural.
    

  

## **Quick drill (1-minute)**

  

Fill with the correct number form (plural or uncountable) based on the cue:

- some ______ (cloud) → **clouds**
    
- a piece of ______ (advice) → **advice** (uncountable)
    
- many ______ (leaf) → **leaves**
    
- some ______ (equipment) → **equipment** (uncountable)
    
- several ______ (bus) → **buses**
    
- a few ______ (photo) → **photos**

## **Q11 — You answered** **D****; correct =** **B & C**

  

**Question:** Which TWO warnings does Dan give about picking mushrooms? (B = don’t pick near busy roads; C = don’t eat mushrooms given to you)

  

### **What Dan actually says (key quotes)**

- “**you should never consume mushrooms picked by friends or neighbours** — always remember that some poisonous mushrooms look very similar to edible ones…” → maps to **C** (“Don’t eat mushrooms given to you”).
    
- “**The other thing to avoid is mushrooms growing beside busy roads for obvious reasons.**” → maps to **B** (“Don’t pick mushrooms near busy roads”).
    

  

### **Why you likely picked D (error cause)**

- You may have **over-generalised** “don’t eat” instructions and misread the target: Dan warns _against consuming others’ picks_, not against eating while you pick (D).
    
- In exam pressure, short negative words (“never”, “avoid”) can blur; you heard the caution but not the **object** (who picked them).
    

  

### **How to avoid it (tactical rules)**

1. **Listen for the direct object** after negation words: when you hear _never / avoid / don’t_, ask immediately **“who/what?”** — e.g., _never consume_ **_mushrooms picked by friends_** _→ answer refers to mushrooms given by others (C)_.
    
2. **Annotate differences in the margin:** write a short code for the object: e.g., never consume (others) vs avoid (roads). This avoids confusing “don’t eat” with “don’t eat while…”.
    
3. **Predict likely paraphrases**: “mushrooms picked by friends” → “mushrooms given to you.” If an option paraphrases that, flag it.
    

---

## **Q16 — You answered incorrectly; correct =** 

## **B (join a group)**

  

### **What Dan actually says (key quotes)**

- “**I wouldn’t recommend going alone or relying on photos in a book…**” — negative about solo/book.
    
- “**There are some really good phone apps… but you can’t always rely on getting a good signal…**” — apps are useful but not a reliable substitute.
    
- “**If possible, you should go with a group led by an expert — you’ll stay safe and learn a lot that way.**” → explicit recommendation: **join a group** = **B**.
    

  

### **Why this is a common trap**

- Dan mentions apps positively earlier, so if you latch on to the first useful-sounding item, you may select **A** (use an app) without hearing the concluding recommendation.
    
- The speaker presents **several options** in quick succession (books, apps, group). The correct answer is the **final, explicit recommendation**; test-takers often pick an earlier-mentioned option.
    

  

### **How to avoid it (tactical rules)**

1. **Listen for recommendation signals**: _“you should…”, “I wouldn’t recommend…”, “if possible, …”_ — these mark the final preferred action.
    
2. **When multiple options are mentioned, prefer the speaker’s final advice.** Flag earlier options as “possible but limited” if hedging language appears (e.g., “but…”, “however”).
    
3. **Note contrast markers**: “I wouldn’t recommend X… There are some good apps, but… If possible, you should Y.” The contrast shifts to the correct choice.
    

---

## **Short practice (apply immediately — 2 minutes)**

  

Read each short excerpt (imagined speech). Which is the recommended action?

1. “I wouldn’t go on my own — phone guides can help, but join a local club if you can.” → **Answer: join a local club (final recommendation).**
    
2. “Books are useful; apps can identify plants too, but remember they aren’t perfect in the field.” → **Answer: neither is strongly recommended — hedged; watch for later ‘should’.**
    
3. “Never eat berries picked by a stranger. You can use a guidebook, but the safest way is to go with an expert.” → **Answer: go with an expert.**
    

  

(If you picked the final recommended action each time, you’ve internalised the rule.)

---

## **Quick checklist for exam day (apply to every Part 2 Q)**

- When you hear **warnings/advice**, mark the exact **object** of the warning (who/what/where).
    
- Underline the **modal phrase** that expresses recommendation: _should / must / wouldn’t recommend / never_. The sentence containing that modal is usually the answer.
    
- If several options are mentioned, **prefer the speaker’s final recommendation** unless the question asks for “mentioned” rather than “recommended”.
    
- When options paraphrase the same idea, map synonyms in your head: _“picked by friends” → “given to you”_.

## **Questions 11–20: Full Breakdown**

  

### **Q11 & Q12 – Choose TWO Warnings**

  

**Question:** Which TWO warnings does Dan give about picking mushrooms?

**Correct Answers:** B and C

- **B**: Don’t pick mushrooms near busy roads.
    
- **C**: Don’t eat mushrooms given to you (i.e., mushrooms picked by friends/neighbours).
    

  

**Tested Skills:**

- Spotting caution language (_“never consume…”, “to avoid…”_).
    
- Paraphrasing: “picked by friends” → “given to you”.
    

  

**Common Pitfalls:**

- Misinterpreting _“don’t eat mushrooms while picking them”_ vs. what was said.
    
- Choosing irrelevant yet plausible distractors.
    

  

**Strategy:**

- Listen for **“never”** or **“avoid”** followed by the **object** (what is forbidden).
    
- Paraphrase: understanding meaning over exact words.

**Question:** What advice does Dan give about picking mushrooms in parks?

**Correct Answer:** C – Get there early.

  

**Tested Skills:**

- Extracting **timing advice** from discussions of competition.
    

  

**Common Pitfalls:**

- Misunderstanding “competition” — it refers to others picking early.
    

  

**Strategy:**

- Listen for **when** to act to avoid competition: “first thing in the morning,” “early.”
    

---

### **Q16 – Advice for Beginners**

  

**Question:** Dan says it is a good idea for beginners to …

**Correct Answer:** B – join a group.

  

**Tested Skills:**

- Identifying recommendations from multiple suggestions.
    

  

**Common Pitfalls:**

- Selecting earlier options (like “use an app”) instead of the main recommendation.

- Note the _modal verbs_ or recommendation phrases: “you should go with a group led by an expert.”
    

---

### **Q17 – Conservation Priority**

  

**Question:** What does Dan say is important for conservation?

**Correct Answer:** B – picking a limited amount of mushrooms.

  

**Tested Skills:**

- Listening for do’s and don’ts related to conservation.
    

  

**Common Pitfalls:**

- Misremembering “never pick all” vs. “fully grown” or “avoiding rare species.”
    

  

**Strategy:**

- Focus on restrictions tied to ecological impact and harvesting rules.
    

---

### **Q18 – Reason for Decline**

  

**Question:** Why are some varieties of wild mushrooms in decline?

**Correct Answer:** C – a rise in building developments locally.

  

**Tested Skills:**

- Picking out cause from multiple reasons mentioned.
    

  

**Common Pitfalls:**

- Choosing superficially plausible but incorrect options (like “demand from restaurants”).

---

### **Q19 – Storing Mushrooms**

  

**Question:** When storing mushrooms, people should …

**Correct Answer:** A – keep them in the fridge for no more than two days.

  

**Tested Skills:**

- Recognizing correct storage advice.
    

  

**Common Pitfalls:**

- Confusing the “bag” used for collection vs. refrigeration duration.

**Strategy:**

- Listen for motivational phrases like _“be adventurous”_ and the practical advice that follows (many dishes).
# Recording 3

## **1) What the question asked**

  

“**Which TWO opinions about the Luddites do the students express?**” — choose **two** options representing the students’ expressed views (their attitudes/opinions in the conversation).

---

## **2) Correct answers and transcript evidence**

- **A — Their actions were ineffective.**
    
    Evidence: Adam says **“Yes, and ultimately, they didn’t achieve anything.”** → direct statement that their actions were ineffective.
    
- **E — Their attitude is understandable.**
    
    Evidence: Gemma says **“I see why the Luddites felt so threatened.”** → explicit empathy; she understands their attitude.
    

  

Those two map exactly to what was said: one factual evaluation (ineffective) and one expression of sympathy/understanding.

---

## **3) Why people (including you) commonly pick the wrong option B**

- **Option B:** “They are still influential today.”
    
    This is _not_ stated in the dialogue. It may feel tempting because the Luddites are a well-known name and sometimes referenced today — but the students never claim contemporary influence.
    
- **Typical error patterns that lead to this:**
    
    - **Over-generalisation:** letting prior knowledge or assumptions about the Luddites replace what the speakers actually said.
        
    - **Missing both items:** in a “choose TWO” question some candidates only find one relevant detail and then guess a plausible second (often from background knowledge).
        
    - **Listening for gist only:** catching the topic (Luddites) but not the specific utterances that express **ineffective** and **understandable**.
        
    

---

## **4) How to avoid this mistake — exact, repeatable tactics**

1. **Listen for exact opinion signals.**
    
    - Words/phrases that indicate judgment: _“they didn’t achieve anything”, “was ineffective”, “that didn’t work”._
        
    - Words that indicate empathy: _“I see why…”, “I can understand”, “I’d have felt the same”._
        
    
2. **Map phrase → option immediately.**
    
    - When you hear _“they didn’t achieve anything”_ write shorthand: **ineffective → A**.
        
    - When you hear _“I see why… felt threatened”_ write **understandable → E**.
        
        This removes the need to remember exact wording later.
        
    
3. **If the question asks for TWO, force yourself to find TWO distinct lines.**
    
    - Don’t stop after the first match. Keep listening and look for a second explicit opinion (not implied).
        
    
4. **Ignore prior knowledge** — focus strictly on what the speakers actually say in the recording.
    
5. **Use short symbols while listening:** J (judgement), S (sympathy), F (fact). Then match them to options. Example: when you hear J → look for option meaning “ineffective”; when S → look for option meaning “understandable.”
    

---

## **5) Quick 3-item practice (do mentally, 2–3 minutes)**

  

Read each mini-excerpt and pick the correct opinion option(s) (A–E). Answers at the end.

1. Speaker A: “They tried hard, but in the end it changed nothing.”
    
    Speaker B: “Still, I can see why they panicked.”
    
    - Which TWO? → __________
        
    
2. Speaker A: “This movement actually inspired much later legislation.”
    
    Speaker B: “No, that’s exaggerated.”
    
    - Which TWO? → __________
        
    
3. Speaker A: “They were violent and broke equipment.”
    
    Speaker B: “It’s easy to criticise them now, but their fears were real.”
    
    - Which TWO? → __________
        
    

  

**Answers:** 1 → A & E (ineffective; understandable).

2 → B (influential) and ??? — trick: B only; if question asks TWO, you’d need a second explicit opinion—not present → avoid guessing.

3 → (A? or C?) Actually A = ineffective (not directly), C = unfair criticism? This item shows you must match exact wording — the safe mapping is E (understandable) and possibly none of the others — again don’t guess.

  

_(Purpose: practice mapping explicit lines to options and spotting when only one clear match exists — that’s a sign you should keep listening for the second.)_

---

## **6) Exam checklist you can use during practice/tests**

- Q asks “Choose **TWO**” → tick box: **FIND 2**.
    
- As you listen, write 1-word notes next to the question slot (e.g., **ineffective**, **understood**).
    
- When matching options, prefer exact paraphrase over plausible background knowledge.
    
- If you have only one match after the section, _replay your notes_ — there must be a second explicit opinion somewhere; keep scanning the transcript in your head.


## **Questions 21–22: Opinions about the Luddites**

  

**Q:** Which TWO opinions about the Luddites do the students express?

**Options:**

A. Their actions were ineffective.

B. They are still influential today.

C. They have received unfair criticism.

D. They were proved right.

E. Their attitude is understandable.

  

**Transcript references:**

- _“With those protesting workers called the Luddites destroying their knitting machines because they were so worried about losing their jobs.”_
    
- _“Yes, and ultimately, they didn’t achieve anything.”_ → **A (ineffective)**
    
- _“Yes, that’s true — but it probably didn’t seem a positive thing at the time. I see why the Luddites felt so threatened.”_
    
- _“I know. I’m sure I would have felt the same.”_ → **E (attitude is understandable)**
    

  

**Answer:** **21–22 → A, E**

  

**Trap:**

- Option **B (still influential)** looks attractive because of historical importance, but the speakers never say the Luddites influenced today.
    
- Option **D (proved right)** is also tempting, but they explicitly said _“industrialisation created more jobs than it destroyed.”_
    

---

## **Questions 23–24: Predictions about the future of work**

  

**Q:** Which TWO predictions about the future of work are the students doubtful about?

**Options:**

A. Work will be more rewarding.

B. Unemployment will fall.

C. People will want to delay retiring.

D. Working hours will be shorter.

E. People will change jobs more frequently.

  

**Transcript references:**

- _“Bit too optimistic … I can’t see how people are about to have more leisure time, when all the evidence shows people are spending longer than ever at work.”_ → **D (working hours will be shorter)**
    
- _“No — that’s true. And what about lower unemployment? I’m not so sure about that. Perhaps in the long term — but not in the foreseeable future.”_ → **B (unemployment will fall)**
    

  

**Answer:** **23–24 → D, B**

  

**Trap:**

- **A (work will be more rewarding):** they actually agree that robots doing boring tasks will make work better → not doubtful.
    
- **C (retiring later):** they confirm this is happening → not doubtful.
    
- **E (change jobs more frequently):** never mentioned.
    

---

## **Questions 25–30: Comments on jobs**

  

**Q:** What comment do the students make about each job?

  

### **25. Accountants → G**

- _“You might think all the technological innovations would have put them out of a job, but in fact there are more of them than ever. They’re still really in demand and have become far more efficient.”_
    
- Both employment ↑ and productivity ↑.
    

  

→ **Answer: G**

---

### **26. Hairdressers → E**

- _“I’d never have thought that demand for hairdressing would have gone up so much … one hairdresser for every 287 people now, compared to one for over 1,500.”_
    
- _“Because people’s earning power has gone up so they can afford to spend more on personal services.”_
    

  

→ **Answer: E (rise due to higher disposable income)**

---

### **27. Administrative staff → B**

- _“The kind of work that administrative staff do has changed enormously … even 20 years ago there were secretaries doing dictation and typing.”_
    
- _“Really boring compared to these days, when they’re given much more responsibility and higher status.”_
    

  

→ **Answer: B (role has become more interesting)**

---

### **28. Agricultural workers → C**

- _“I’d expected there to be a much bigger change … But the 1871 census showed 25% of the population worked on the land.”_
    
- _“Now it’s less than 0.2%.”_
    

  

→ **Answer: C (number has fallen dramatically)**

---

### **29. Care workers → F**

- _“They barely existed in the 19th century as people’s lifespan was so much shorter. But now of course this sector will see huge growth.”_
    

  

→ **Answer: F (significant rise in demand)**

---

### **30. Bank clerks → A**

- _“The future looks quite bleak for bank clerks. They’ve been in decline since ATMs were introduced in the eighties.”_
    
- _“Technology will certainly make most of the jobs they do now redundant.”_
    

  

→ **Answer: A (likely to be at risk)**

---

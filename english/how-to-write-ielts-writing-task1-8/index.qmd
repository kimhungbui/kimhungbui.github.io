# Common language problems

In this lesson, we will focus on being precise with our language when describing a map or plan, and writing about the future. We will also work on a band 6.5 sample answer and turn it into a band 8+ sample before looking at her answer.

Our question:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250807160458.png)

## Talking about the future plans

Our writing task makes it clear that the changes have not been made yet, so this is our first task where we need to write about the future. This means we need to compare the sports centre now with the sports center in the future, and write about changes that __will take place__ or that __will be carried out__.

As we saw in Lesson 7, if we are using the passive, only the verb __to be__ need to change.

- _The sports center __is going to be made__ bigger_
- _The sports center __will be made__ bigger_
- _The sports center __will be expanded___

Be careful when talking about __'future plan'__. We use this phrase when asking about someone's 'plans for the future' (e.g. __What are your future plans?__). Look at the following example:

_The __maps illustrate__ the __present scheme__ of a university's sport complex and __its future plans for renovation__._

I task 1, we are presented with current or existing plans - it is the __renovation__ or __redevelopment__ that will occur in the future. So this should say:

_The __plans__ show the present __layout__ of a university's sports complex and __plans for its future renovation__._

At first glance, this looks okay, but it's redundant and slightly awkward. Why?

üîé Problem:

‚ÄúFuture plans‚Äù is repetitive ‚Äî plans are always about the future.

Saying ‚Äúfuture plans for renovation‚Äù is like saying ‚Äúplans that will happen in the future‚Äù ‚Äî it's a bit wordy and unnecessary in formal writing.

Also, ‚Äúscheme‚Äù is a bit outdated or too technical. In IELTS, ‚Äúlayout‚Äù is a more natural, accurate word when describing maps.

‚úÖ Correct and Clear Version:

‚ÄúThe plans show the present layout of a university's sports complex and plans for its future renovation.‚Äù

üîç Why this is better:

‚ÄúPlans‚Äù is already a map-based word used for showing designs or layouts.

‚ÄúLayout‚Äù is the clearest word for physical arrangement of a place.

‚ÄúPlans for its future renovation‚Äù is clear and concise. It avoids redundancy.
## Writing about location: When, Why

In many task 1 answer based on maps and plans, candidates describe the exact location of almost every detail they mention. Effectively, this highlights the location in a way that can seem odd. Look at the following examples:

1. <font color="#ff0000">A leisure pool will be constructed to the left of the changing room, on the left of the sports center</font>.
2. <font color="#ff0000">A cafe and a sports shop are going to be built next to the east and west of the changing room</font>.

Remember, we should __select__ key information to include in our summary. Mentioning the precise location for every element not only makes our writing repetitive, but also makes it difficult to separate the key information from the minor details. Notice also that these details are not presented logically. The changing rooms mentioned in the first example only exist because there is a pool and users of the pool will need one, so it is more logical to say that '_some changing rooms have been built next to the pool_'. The referencing in this sentence is also unclear - we do not know what is '_on the left of the sports center_.' - does this refer to the changing room or the leisure pool?

Similarly, sentence number 2 suggests the location of these changing rooms is linked to the cafe and sports shop in some way. Problems like this occur when we describe the plans as though they are a picture rather than thinking about what the images actually represent. Thinking about how people will use this space can help us to be more logical in our summary of it - we can see an example of this in 8.2

:::{.callout-tip}
With a map or plan task, think about what the images in the diagram represent and how the different parts work together, or how people might use this space. This will help us to write about it in a more logical way.
:::

Remember, we don't need to give the precise location of every detail - only do this if we can see a reason for it. For example, if it helps to highlight a change (that a new facility has been built in the same location as something that has now been removed), or explain a change of location.

## How to write about location

There are several ways to explain the location of something. Here are some examples:

- _Explain the location in relation to something else: __there is a changing room <font color="#0070c0">next to</font> the pool___
- _Use the compass. __The outdoor courts <font color="#0070c0">on the east and west</font> of the building have been removed__._
- _Refer to parts of the plan or the building: __the entrance is at <font color="#0070c0">the front of</font> the building___.

### Exercises

Look at the plan below and try to think of a short sentence using the following words and phrases:

_at the front of, at the back of, behind, between, in front of, opposite, next to, on the right of_

![](Pasted%20image%2020250807163526.png)


The reception is _at the front of_ the building.

The sports shop is _opposite / in front of_ the leisure pool

The cafe is _opposite / in front of_ the sports hall.

The seating area is _between_ the pool and the sports hall.

The gym is _behind_ the pool

The gym is _at the back of_ the building.

The dance studio is _next to_ the gym.

The dance studios are _to the right of / on the right_ of the sports hall.


:::{.callout-tip}
## Vocabulary note
Notice that we say __X is opposite Y__ (__not__ X is opposite ~~to~~ Y).
:::

## Some do's and don'ts

- Only explain the location of one element at a time. (i.e. don't say: <font color="#ff0000">to the left of the changing room, on the left of the sports centre</font>).
- Only use the points of a compass to refer to larger areas (for example, __the northern side of the building; on the east coast__) and only use words with an awareness of their style. Look at the following example:
  
  _The gym will be expanded <font color="#ff0000">to the east, in the neighborhood of which</font> two dance studios will be built._

It is true that the gym will be expanded (made bigger), but adding '<font color="#ff0000">to the east</font>' is odd here for a relatively small space within a building. The phrase '<font color="#ff0000">in the neighborhood of</font>' can be used literally to mean 'in a specific area of the town/city', but she think this writer was trying to use this phrase with its idiomatic meaning of '_close to_' or '_about_'. For example, '_I was hoping to pay in the neighborhood of $250,0000 for the house_'. However, this is a little too informal for a writing test, and we should aim to be <font color="#0070c0">literal</font> when giving precise details of location, so the style and meaning are not appropriate here.

The verb form of the adjective '_long_' can be useful here: <font color="#0070c0">to lengthen</font>. 

_The gym <font color="#0070c0">will be lengthened</font> and two dance studios will be built._

Here are some other useful verbs like this


| Adjective | Noun                                | Verb                                                                                                   |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| deep      | <font color="#0070c0">depth</font>  | To <font color="#0070c0">deepen</font> / to make something deeper                                      |
| long      | <font color="#0070c0">length</font> | To <font color="#0070c0">lengthen</font> something / to make something longer                          |
| wide      | <font color="#0070c0">width</font>  | To <font color="#0070c0">widen</font> something / to make something wider                              |
| tall      | <font color="#0070c0">height</font> | To <font color="#0070c0">make something taller</font>                                                  |
| short     |                                     | To <font color="#0070c0">shorten</font> something / to make something shorter                          |
| high      |                                     | To <font color="#0070c0">make something higher</font>                                                  |
| low       |                                     | To <font color="#0070c0">lower</font> something / to <font color="#0070c0">make something lower</font> |

Notice that _tall, short, high_ and _low_ do not have a specific noun form (when we measure the _height_ of something, it may be _all, short, high, or low_) and _tall_ and _high_ do not have a specific verb form (the verb 'to heighten' means 'to increase the amount of something' and is used with abstract ideas (e.g. <font color="#0070c0">to heighten awareness, to heighten tension</font>))

# Addressing band 6 problems

Below is a band 6.5 sample answer to this question. We will address the language problems first then go on to fix any problems with Coherence and cohesion, then Task achievement.

Read the sample answer and see if you can find any language problems. think about:

- Vocabulary
- how to describe location
- the use of articles

The two plans illustrate the main changes which will take place in a university sports center.

Overall, although the central area will be largely retained, the total area of the sports centre will be extended, and more facilities will be added.

In the current plan, the sports centre's functions are limited. Within the building, there are two main sports facilities, one of which is the 25-meter pool in the center, and another is the gym in the north of the area. To serve their functions well, the changing room is constructed in the west of them, and the auditorium is on the eastern of the construction. As for the reception, it is the exact opposite of the entrance. In terms of the outdoor areas, courts are on either side of the building. 

According to the future plans, sports centre will become versatile after some changes. Courts in the open space will be removed, while much more facilities will be added, from recreational facilities such as cafe on the right of the entrance, and the sports shops on the left, to the sports facilities, like leisure pool in the western areas, and two dance studios on the northeast corner of the building. Existing facilities are also going to be expanded including the gym, seating area, changing room and reception. The swimming pool is the only one which will remain the same in the future.

Think about how to correct the highlighted language problems in red.

![](Pasted%20image%2020250807171104.png)

:::{.callout-note}
## Language problems

1. This is a defining relative clause, so 'that' can also be used here. We can't leave it out because this is the subject of the verbs 'to take place' and 'remain' (in the final sentence). She find 'which' is often overused, so she have changed it to 'that' in later versions.
2. We know about the sports centers facilities, but we don't know in functions.
3. The direct article (the) is used to refer to something already mentioned, but this is the first mention, so we need the indefinite article (a)
4. 'in the north of' and (below) 'in the west of' would be used with a larger area (e.g. in the north of the island). Think about how to describe where the gym and the changing rooms are located - NB, they are located within the building not 'the area'.
5. There is a vocabulary problem here - why use the verb 'constructed'? The changing room 'is located' there now and 'was constructed' at some time in the past. Similarly with 'construction' below ('the building' is better).
6. It isn't clear what the 'auditorium' refers to - perhaps the 'seating'?
7. 'opposite' has a different meaning when it is used like this - it refers to the characteristics of someone or something (e.g. 'My sister likes parties but I am the exact opposite.') With location, we can say that something is 'directly opposite' something else.
8. We omit the article when we are referring to something in general or 'all' (e.g. all people, all courts etc.). We need an article (e.g. a/the) or determiner here (Some courts, two courts etc.)
9. We need a comparative here (e.g. it will become more versatile)
10. There is a vocabulary problem here - it is better to refer to these as 'The two outdoor courts' or 'The two courts on the outside of the building'
11. 'much' is used with uncountable nouns ('how much sugars?' etc.) 'many' is used with countable nouns (e.g. facilities). 
12. 'like' is too informal - 'such as' or 'including' are better here
13. It isn't clear what these 'areas' are - 'side' is better and we need more information ('the western side' of what?)
14. This should be 'in' the corner ('on the corner' is used for outside (e.g. on the corner of  a street))
:::

## Addressing Coherence and cohesion problems

The language is changed in blue. Coherence and cohesion are generally managed well in this answer. She has highlighted five problems areas where the ideas are difficult to follow, where referencing is not clear, or where the information could be more logically organized. Can we identify the problems and suggest a way to fix them?


The two plans illustrate the main changes <font color="#0070c0">that</font> will take place in a university sports center.

Overall, although the central area will be largely retained, the total area of the sports center will be extended, and more facilities will be added.

In the current plan, the sports center's <font color="#245bdb">facilities</font> are limited. Within the building, there are two main facilities, one of which is <font color="#245bdb">a</font> 25-meter pool in the center, and another is <font color="#245bdb">a</font> gym <font color="#245bdb">at the back of the building</font>. <span style="background:#b1ffff">(1) To serve their functions well</span>, a changing room <font color="#245bdb">is located on the left</font>  (2) <span style="background:#b1ffff">of them</span>, and <font color="#245bdb">a seating area</font> on the eastern side of the <font color="#245bdb">building</font>. (3) <span style="background:#b1ffff">As for the reception</span>, <font color="#245bdb">it is directly opposite</font> the entrance. In terms of the outdoor areas, <font color="#245bdb">there are</font> courts on either side of the building.

According to the future plans, <font color="#245bdb">the</font> sports center will become <font color="#245bdb">more</font> versatile after some changes <font color="#245bdb">are made</font>. (4) <span style="background:#b1ffff"><font color="#245bdb">The outdoor</font> courts will be removed, while <font color="#245bdb">many</font> more facilities will be added, from recreational facilities such as <font color="#245bdb">a</font> cafe on the right of the entrance, and <font color="#245bdb">a</font> sports <font color="#245bdb">shop</font> on the left, to sports facilities, <font color="#245bdb">including a</font> leisure pool on the <font color="#245bdb">western side of the center</font>, and two dance studios in the northeast corner of the building.</span> <font color="#245bdb">The</font> existing facilities are also going to be expanded including the gym, seating area, changing room and reception. The swimming pool is the only (5) <span style="background:#b1ffff">one</span> <font color="#245bdb">that</font> will remain the same in the future.

:::{.callout-note}
1. This is difficult to follow and appears to be going too far and making a comment not supported by the data (to + the infinitive tell us the reason something was done - but we have no idea why the current plan is organized like this). It would be better to think about the people who will use these facilities and begin: "Visitors have access to ..."
2. the reference is not clear here - on the left of what? This is too far away from the mention of the pool and the gym.
3. 'As for the reception' suggests that we have already had some information about the reception and are returning to this topic. We don't need a change in topic as this is still explaining what is 'Within the building', and the next sentence nicely changes the topic to what is outside the building ('In terms of the outdoor areas ...'). This sentence would just introduce the current reception: 'There is a ...'
4. There is too much information included in this sentence, which makes it difficult to follow. The order of the information is not as logical as it could be - it often helps the reader if you mirror the order of information in the first paragraph. The writer has tried to separate the information into 'recreation facilities' and 'sports facilities', but it does seem that at all of these facilities are 'recreational'. Can you think of another umbrella term to use instead of 'recreational facilities'?
5. Again, the reference here is a little unclear 'one of' what? (Think about what this refers back to)
:::

## Task achievement problems

Now read through the answer after most of these changes have been made and consider Task achievement. Think to particular about the following:

- Does the sample present a clear overview of the main changes (Band 7)?
- Does it present and highlight the key features (the main changes) (Band 7)?
- Does it 'cover the requirements of the task' (summarising the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and making comparisons where relevant) (Band 7)
- Are there any key features missing? Are there details that are inaccurate? (Band 6)
- What improvements can you suggest to improve this answer?

***
The two plans illustrate the main changes that will take place in a university sports center.

Overall, although the central area will be largely retained, the total area of the sports center will be extended, and more facilities will be added.

In the current plan, the sports center's facilities are limited. Within the building, there are two main facilities, one of which is a 25-meter pool in the center, and another is a gym at the back of the building. <font color="#245bdb">Visitors have access to</font> a changing room located on the left <font color="#245bdb">of the swimming pool</font> and a seating area on the eastern side of the building. <font color="#245bdb">There is a reception</font> directly opposite the entrance. In terms of the outdoor areas, there are courts on either side of the building.

According to the future plans, the sports center will become more versatile after some changes are made. The outdoor courts will be removed, while many more facilities will be added, from recreational facilities such as a cafe on the right of the entrance, and a sports shop on the left, to sports facilities, including a leisure pool on the western side of the center, and two dance studios in the northeast corner of the building. The existing facilities are also going to be expanded including the gym, seating area, changing room and reception. The swimming pool is the only <font color="#245bdb">facility</font> that will remain the same in the future.
***

One of the main problems in this answer is that the first body paragraph looks in detail at the current plan, and the second body paragraph seems to rush through and list the main changes, which means they are not highlighted. As our task is to highlight the main changes, logically, there should be more information about the second plan than the first.

:::{.callout-tip}
Our second paragraph should work together with our first paragraph to present a clear picture of the main changes. Don't see them as completely separate. This is particularly true for map and plan tasks.
:::

Use these questions to think about how to improve the Task achivement score in this answer:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250807160458.png)


When making your changes, think about the logical organization of the information as well as how to move to a new topic.

We can see the changes her made below in blue:

***
The two plans illustrate the main changes that will take place in a university sports center.

Overall, although the central area will be largely retained, the total area of the sports center will be extended, <font color="#245bdb">replacing the outdoor facilities, and more indoor facilities will be added</font>.

In the current plan, the sports center's facilities are <font color="#245bdb">quite</font> limited. Within the building, there are two main facilities: <font color="#245bdb">a 25-meter pool in the center and a gym at the back of the building</font>. <font color="#245bdb">Visitors have access to a changing room and a seating area near the swimming pool</font>. There is a <font color="#245bdb">small reception near the entrance</font>. In terms of the outdoor areas, there are courts on either side of the building.

According to the future plans, the outdoor courts will be removed and the central building will be expanded. More indoor sports facilities will be added, such as a new leisure pool on the western side of the center, a sports hall on the eastern side, and two dance studios in the northeast corner of the building. With the existing facilities, the gym is going to be made longer, but the swimming pool and other facilities will remain the same. In terms of the other amenities, the reception area will be in the same place but it will be wider than at present, and visitors to the new center will be able to make use of a cafe and a sports shop, which will be located near the entrance.

## Point to notice

- The overview now contains all of the key information. With this question, the main changes needed for a clear overview are:
	1. The new center will be bigger
	2. it will have more / a wider range of facilities
	3. the outdoor facilities will be gone

- Notice the order of information. In the first paragraph, this writer logically began by describing the sports facilities (this is a sports center so naturally these are the main facilities here.) It is helpful to the reader and more logical to use the same order in the second paragraph.
- In rewriting some of the sentences, she thought about how people will use the facility (the visitors). Doing this gave her a new way to write about the changes and helped her to avoid repetition.
- She added more comparisons in the second body paragraph to highlight the main changes that will take place - remember, this is our task here.

:::{.callout-tip}
Remember, our task is to highlight the main changes that will take place, so it is important to make comparisons to show these changes.
:::

- This answer could still be improved - it is now quite long (246 words). This is because she had to add a reference to the location of the entrance and reception in paragraph 2 so that the same detail in the first paragraph makes sense of seems relevant. This shows that the information we include in our first paragraph has an effect on the information in our second paragraph - don't see them as separate - like the two plans we are given, they work together to present a clear picture of the changes.
- Changing the first paragraph so that the <font color="#245bdb">location</font> of the reception is not highlighted (or made to seem important) helps:
![](Pasted%20image%2020250812200944.png)

:::{.callout-tip}
Our body paragraphs work together to present a clear picture - don't see them as separate. This is particularly true for map and plan tasks.

# Model Answer

Look at her model answer and think about:

- Her overview
- The organization - how do the paragraphs work together?
- Vocabulary (are there any special words she used that we need to learn?)

***
The plans show a university sports center as it is now and the new layout following its redevelopment. Overall, while some outdoor facilities will be lost, the new center will be significantly larger and will cater for a wider range of sports.

The sports center currently consists of a relatively small central building with an outdoor court on each side. The building houses a 25-meter pool, with a seating area and changing room, and there is a gym to the rear and a reception area to the front.

Following the renovations, only the central pool and its facilities will remain the same. The building will be expanded to the east and west, removing the outdoor courts and making way for more indoor facilities. These include a leisure pool on the western side, which will be slightly larger than the existing one and will have its own changing room, and on the eastern side, a new sports hall, and two dance studios. The current gym will be lengthened so that it is double its current size. The reception area will also be widened, making it more spacious. On arrival, visitors to the new center will benefit from a third changing room, a sports shop and a cafe, all located around the reception area.
***

:::{.callout-tip}
## Vocabulary note
- to house = to provide space for something (NB the pronunciation is different to the noun - the final sound is 'z' not 's'.)
- to cater for = to provide for (e.g. to provide food for / to provide facilities for)
- more spacious = having more space
- the rear = the back

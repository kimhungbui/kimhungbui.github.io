body paragraph 1


Adding sports facilities would certainly be an attractive idea to some. However, this proposal assumes that the main reason people are unhealthy is that they lack access to such facilities. In reality, many public health issues occur due to a combination of factors, and lack of exercises is only one of these. Among other key factors are poor diet, work stress, and a lack of time to address them. Furthermore, sophisticated equipment is not essential for getting fit; walking or running in the street would also achieve this. Thus, if a lack of facilities is not responsible for current health problems, simply adding more will not solve them.

body paragraph 2

Clearly, other measures are required to improve public health. If people lack the time to take care of themselves, then we need to find a way to address this. It may require a change in attitude, and to see taking time out from the pressures of work as healthy rather than a sign of laziness or weakness. If more people did this, not only would work stress be reduced, but they would also have more time to exercise. The issue of diet could be tackled by persuading people to cook nutritious meals themselves rather than choosing a faster alternative. Nevertheless, these solutions will take time and, for those who cannot reduce their working hours, are likely to be ineffective. Seemingly, when it comes to solving complex health problems, there is no simple solution.


Model answer

Public health is a growing concern, with many countries reporting increasing levels of obesity. Some believe the problem can be addressed by adding more sports facilities, while others think this may not be enough. A closer look at the problem will help in assessing these views.

In conclusion, in my view, giving people who are time-poor greater access to sports facilities will not be effective and is too simplistic a solution. Other measures are clearly required, but any action taken to improve public health requires a change in lifestyle, and this needs the cooperation of everyone involved.

# A Positive or a negative development

Our diet is becoming increasingly unhealthy. This is reflected in the fact that cheap, fast food, and sugary drinks are now found in many shops around the world. However, the low prices and convenience come at a cost.

Undoubtedly, the easy access to prepared meals and canned drinks has some advantages. Firstly, this type of food is abundant because it appeals to our taste buds. People would not eat it so often if they did not enjoy it. The low cost also means that people on a lower income can afford to feed their families, and it is made even more appealing because it also saves time in the kitchen. There are also now so many big businesses based on producing this type of food and drink that many workers are dependent on the selling or making of it, and this industry is a key employer of many lower income families. These advantages show that this development is likely to continue for some time.

Nevertheless, the negative effects are significant. The low cost of fast food means that it has become more of a staple diet for many people. It is widely acknowledge that processed and sugary foods are unhealthy, so their widespread consumption is concerning. Such food contains many additives, offer little nutrition, and is largely seen as responsible for the growing obesity problems around the world. In addition, there are links to diabetes, all of which affects the economy as well as putting pressure on the healthcare system. Ultimately, the problem associated with this type of food have an impact on everyone.

In conclusion, the availability, convenience, and appeal of this type of food means that it is likely to be here to stay. Nevertheless, the long-term health effects show that, on the whole, this is a negative development. Finding a way to increase the cost would go some way to solving this.


staple diet = the main food/s eaten by a person or in a country

additives = chemicals added to food and drink (often to preserve or to add taste)

# Cambridge IELTS 17 - listening test 1




# Performance Summary


# Recording 1

### **Q2: No … on the beach**

- **You wrote:** DOG
    
- **Correct answer:** DOGS
    
- **Recording clue:**
    
    > Peter: _“I’m afraid not, as they’re banned from the beach itself.”_
    
- **Why plural?**
    
    - The question asks about **what is banned** generally. English grammar requires **plural nouns** when talking about things in general: _dogs are banned_, not _dog is banned_.
        
    
- **Tip:** Look for **general statements** about rules—these usually take the plural form.

### **Q6: Walk across the sands and reach the …**

- **You wrote:** BEACH
    
- **Correct answer:** ISLAND
    
- **Recording clue:**
    
    > Peter: _“We’ll be meeting in the car park at Dunsmore Beach at low tide – that’s when the sands are dry enough for us to walk to the island without getting wet.”_
    
- **Why ISLAND?**
    
    - The **destination of the walk** is the island, not the beach (the beach is just the starting point).
        
    
- **Tip:** Pay attention to **prepositions and verbs** indicating direction, e.g., “walk to …” → destination is the answer.

### **Q9: Making … out of wood**

- **You wrote:** SPOON
    
- **Correct answer:** SPOONS
    
- **Recording clue:**
    
    > Peter: _“You’ll be starting with wooden spoons … anything you make is yours to take home with you.”_
    
- **Why plural?**
    
    - The participants can make **more than one spoon**, so the plural form is correct.
        
    
- **Tip:** Listen for plural references in sentences like “anything you make” or “we keep the number … down,” which imply multiple items.
    

---

✅ **Summary of your error pattern:**

1. Singular vs plural: always check if the statement is **general or multiple items**.
    
2. Destination vs starting point: listen carefully for **“to” / “towards”**.
    
3. Minor spelling/plural errors can cost points—listen for context clues.

### **Q12: What colour are the tour boats?**

- **You answered:** A. dark red
    
- **Correct answer:** C. light green
    
- **Recording clue:**
    
    > _“They used to be jet black, but our new ones now have these comfortable dark red seats and a light-green exterior in order to stand out from others …”_
    
- **Why C is correct:**
    
    - The **seats** are dark red, but the **exterior** (the main visible part of the boat) is **light green**.
        
    - IELTS often tests attention to **exact detail**; don’t confuse interior features with overall appearance.

### **Q13: Which lunchbox is suitable for someone who doesn’t eat meat or fish?**

- **You answered:** C. Lunchbox 3
    
- **Correct answer:** B. Lunchbox 2
    
- **Recording clue:**
    
    > _“Lunchbox 1 contains ham and tomato sandwiches. Lunchbox 2 contains a Cheddar cheese roll and Lunchbox 3 is salad-based and also contains eggs and tuna.”_
    
- **Why B is correct:**
    
    - A vegetarian would **avoid meat and fish**.
        
    - Lunchbox 2 contains **Cheddar cheese** (no meat, no fish) → suitable.
        
    - Lunchbox 3 contains **tuna**, which is fish → not vegetarian.
        
    
- **Tip:** Always check **all ingredients**, not just the label like “salad-based.”
    

---

✅ **Key takeaways from these mistakes:**

1. Distinguish **parts of objects** (seats vs exterior).
    
2. Always **read/listen carefully for hidden ingredients** when identifying dietary suitability.
    
3. Double-check “contains” statements; first impressions may mislead.

### **Q21: What problem did both Diana and Tim have when arranging their work experience?**

- **You answered:** (probably B or C)
    
- **Correct answer:** A. making initial contact with suitable farms
    
- **Recording clue:**
    
    - Tim: _“I found mine through a friend of my mother’s, but it wasn’t easy.”_
        
    - Diana: _“finding the right sort of farm to apply to wasn’t easy.”_
        
    
- **Why A is correct:** Both struggled to **find a farm and make initial contact**.
    
- **Why B and C are wrong:**
    
    - Tim mentions transport and length issues, but Diana’s main issue was finding the right farm. The shared problem is **initial contact**.

### **Q24: What did the students learn about adding supplements to chicken feed?**

- **You answered:** B or C
    
- **Correct answer:** A. These should only be given if specially needed
    
- **Recording clue:**
    
    > _“my farmer said some are overpriced… he didn’t give them as a matter of routine, just at times when the chickens seemed to particularly require them.”_
    
- **Why A is correct:** Supplements are **not routine**, only **when required**.
    
- **Why B/C are wrong:**
    
    - The discussion did not mention effectiveness or limiting amounts; it focused on **necessity**.

### **Q30: Wildlife medication**

- **You answered:** D. They were both surprised how little is known…
    
- **Correct answer:** C. Diana may do some further study on this
    
- **Recording clue:**
    
    > Diana: _“I thought I might write my dissertation on something connected with that.”_
    
- **Why C is correct:** She **may do further study**, not that they were surprised.
    
- **Why D is wrong:** Tim mentions being surprised in another module (animal disease), not wildlife medication.
    

✅ **Key takeaways:**

1. Focus on **shared vs individual experiences** when the question asks “both.”
    
2. Look for **explicit statements of opinion or intention** (e.g., “I might write my dissertation…”).
    
3. Don’t confuse **examples of surprise** with the module being asked about.
    

# Recording 4

For **Q33**, the correct answer is **CONFUSION**.

- **Text evidence:**
    
    > “The word ‘maze’ is believed to come from a Scandinavian word for a state of confusion.”
    
- **Why “CONFUSION” is correct:** The passage explicitly links the origin of the word _maze_ to **confusion**, not “amazing.”
    
- **Common mistake:** Some might be misled by the text mentioning _amazing_, but that just explains the etymology of the English word _amazing_, not the meaning of _maze_.

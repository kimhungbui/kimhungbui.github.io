| **Silent letters**                   | Knight, Island               | Hearing sound that isn’t written             | Visualise common silent letters (kn-, -gh, -mb, etc.) when writing       |
| **Unusual vowel combinations**       | Staunfirth                   | “au” can sound like “o” or “aw”              | Write vowel sounds phonetically first, then match to possible spellings  |
| **Double vs single consonants**      | Traveller / Traveler         | Over/under-adding letters                    | Listen for length of sound, but check spelling rules for British English |

| **Homophones**                       | Write / Right, Sail / Sale   | Same sound, different meaning                | Use context of question to decide correct meaning & spelling             |

| **Compound names**                   | Newtown, Southport           | May sound like two separate words            | Check if it’s one word or two; context often hints at place names        |
| **Extra letters in British English** | Jewellery, Manoeuvre         | Extra vowels compared to US spelling         | Remember British spelling rules for IELTS                                |

Notice that _tall, short, high_ and _low_ do not have a specific noun form (when we measure the _height_ of something, it may be _all, short, high, or low_) and _tall_ and _high_ do not have a specific verb form (the verb 'to heighten' means 'to increase the amount of something' and is used with abstract ideas (e.g. <font color="#0070c0">to heighten awareness, to heighten tension</font>))

'opposite' has a different meaning when it is used like this - it refers to the characteristics of someone or something (e.g. 'My sister likes parties but I am the exact opposite.') With location, we can say that something is 'directly opposite' something else.

Here’s why:

- **Part 1, 2, and 4** are mostly about **facts and details** (numbers, names, specific terms, processes). If you put 100% attention there (every word, every sound), you catch the small details, and your accuracy stays high.
    
- **Part 3** is more about **meaning and relationships between speakers**. If you use the same “100% detail focus,” your brain overloads because students often talk casually, add fillers, or change direction. That’s why when you reduce focus to 70–80% and listen more for _meaning and flow_, you actually do better.
    

  

So your strategy is **partly correct**:

- **Deep focus (100%)** → best for **Parts 1, 2, and 4** (details matter).
    
- **Broader focus (70–80%)** → best for **Part 3** (main idea + speaker agreement/disagreement).
    

  
# Process - Writing task 1

## Natural
## Man-made

1. The materials need to produce something = raw materials
2. The different foods used in a recipe = ingredients
3. To remove something you want = to extract
4. To remove solids from a liquid or gas = to filter
5. Requiring a lot of workers / work = labour-intensive
6. By hand = manually
7. By machine = mechanically
8. Large machines = machinery
9. Mostly = largely
10. Completely = wholly
11. Following this = subsequently
12. To make something colder = to cool
13. To make something hotter = to heat
14. To allow something to fall = to drop
### **The problem**

  

Switching focus styles _within the same test_ can feel unstable — your brain doesn’t always adapt quickly between Part 2 and Part 3.

  

### **The solution**

  

Train to **control your “focus lens”**:

- **Zoom-in mode (100%)**: for details (spelling, numbers, technical words).
    
- **Zoom-out mode (70–80%)**: for main ideas, student opinions, reasons.
    

  

Practice switching deliberately:

1. Do one Part 3 section listening only for _meaning_, not details. Summarize in 2 sentences.
    
2. Then do one Part 1/4 focusing on catching **every single keyword**.
    
3. Alternate until your brain naturally shifts mode depending on section.

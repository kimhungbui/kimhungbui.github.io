# Finding collocations

There are two main ways in which we can find collocations

- We can train ourselves to notice them whenever we read or listen to anything in English.

Look at the collocations that are worth learning from this short text in English.

_After __giving__ Mark a __lift__ to the airport, Julie __made her way__ home. What an exciting __life__ he __led__! At times Julie felt __desperately jealous__ of him. She __spent her time__ doing little more than __taking care of__ him and the children. Now her sister was __getting divorced__ and would doubtless be making demands on her too. Julie had promised to __give__ her sister __a call__ as soon as she got home but she decided to __run__ herself a __bath__ first. She had a __sharp pain__ in her side and hoped that a hot bath might __ease the pain__._

:::{.callout-tip}
Get into the habit of making a note of any good collocations you come across in any English text you read.
:::

- We can find them in any good learner's dictionary.
For example, if we look up the word _sharp_ we will find some of these collocations

a sharp pain

a sharp bend/turn

a sharp contrast/difference/distinction

a sharp rise/increase/drop

:::{.callout-tip}
When you look up a new word, make a point of noting it down in several different collocations.

# Recording collocations

The best way to record a collocation is in a phrase or a sentence showing how it is used. Highlight the collocation by underlining it or by using a highlight pen.

For example: I don't <u>have access to</u> that kind of secret information.

Or: Jim gave me a very useful <span style="background:#fff88f">piece of advice</span>.

# Learning collocations

Learning collocations is not so different from learning any vocabulary item. The key things are to:

- regularly revise what we want to learn
- practice using what we want to learn in contexts that are meaningful for us personality
- learn collocations in groups to help us fix them in our memory. We might group together collocations relating to the same topic. Or we might group collocations based on the same word, for example:
  
I must __find a way__ to help him.

Can you __find your way__ back to my house?

I __learnt the hard way__ that Jack can't be trusted.

Please tell me if I'm __getting in your way__.

You must __give way to__ traffic from the left.

I've __tried every possible way__ to get him to change his mind.

In the morning I made some work in the garden, then I spent a rest for about an hour before going out to have some shopping in town. It was my sister's birthday and I wanted to do a special effort to cook a nice meal for her. I gave a look at a new Thai cookery book in the bookshop and decided to buy it. It has some totally easy recipes and I managed to do a good impression with my very first Thai meal. I think my sister utterly enjoyed her birthday.

# Performance summary
Correct: 38/40

# Recording 1

## **Q3 (you wrote**  **INSECTS** **— correct answer** **DATA***)**

  

**Where it appears in the recording:** “They also collect and analyse **data** about the things they see.”

**Why DATA is correct:** the verbs _collect and analyse_ naturally collocate with _data_ (you collect/record data, not collect insects in this context).

**Why you were tempted:** earlier the speaker mentions _birds and insects_ in the list of wildlife, and the science activity also involves plants and insects — it’s easy to grab a nearby noun instead of the object of the verb phrase.

**How to avoid it:** focus on the **verb + object** pair. When you hear _collect / analyse_, expect a **non-count / abstract noun** (data / information / evidence) rather than a concrete species name. Train yourself to listen one or two words after the verb phrase to catch the direct object.

  
## Q7 DISCOVERY -> FREEDOM

  

**Where it appears in the recording:** “I would imagine they get a sense of **freedom** that might not be a normal part of their lives.”

**Why FREEDOM is correct:** the exact phrase is _a sense of freedom_.

**Why you were tempted:** the paragraph earlier uses _explore and discover_, so _discovery_ feels topically relevant and was in your short-term memory.

**How to avoid it:** watch for **fixed expressions** such as _a sense of ____. If the speaker uses _a sense of …_, the missing word is usually an abstract state (freedom, independence, belonging). Also, when you hear the pattern “I would imagine they get a sense of …”, slow down in your head and expect one concrete abstract noun — not a gerund or verbal noun derived from the previous sentence.

  
## Q10 LEADER -> LEADERS
  

**Where it appears in the recording:** “There’s no charge for **leaders** and other adults - as many as you want to bring.”

**Why LEADERS (plural) is correct:** the phrase _as many as you want_ makes clear the plural; the recording explicitly uses _leaders_.

**Why you were tempted:** hearing the single word _leader_ in isolation (or reading the question fragment quickly) can look plausible, but it fails the grammar/number test.

**How to avoid it:** check **number signals** in the sentence (as many / each / every / a / the). If the context allows more than one, answer must be plural. For summary completion always re-read the sentence mentally with your candidate word: does it fit grammatically?

## **Quick practice drills (2 minutes)**

1. Hear the verb **“collect and analyse”** → supply the noun that collocates (answer: **data**).
    
2. Hear the phrase **“a sense of …”** → think of abstract nouns that fit (freedom, pride, belonging). Practice choosing the one that fits the passage meaning.
    
3. Hear **“as many as …”** or **“each”** → force yourself to write plural vs singular appropriately (leaders ≠ leader

Look again at the original sentence from the recording:

  

_“There’s no charge for_ **_leaders_** _and other_ **_adults_** _— as many as you want to bring.”_

- The word **adults** is plural, and it’s paired with **leaders** in the same structure.
    
- In English, when two nouns are linked with **and** in a parallel list, they normally match in number and form.
    
- If it were singular, the sentence would be odd: _“no charge for leader and other adults”_ — imbalance.
    

  

So yes, **ADULTS** works as a **plural signal** for the missing word.

  

### **Strategy tip:**

  

When filling blanks in IELTS **sentence completion**, always:

1. Look **left and right** of the blank for number cues (plural nouns, “as many as,” “other,” “these”).
    
2. Match your word form to those cues — IELTS often plants the singular/plural trap.

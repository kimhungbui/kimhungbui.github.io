Wrong answer

| 10       | TRUE         | FALSE         | STATEMENT:  According to research, 26% of visitor satisfaction is related to their accommodation.<br><br>INCORRECT. The passage says: "...activities are the key driver of visitor satisfaction, contributing 74%, while transport and accommodation account for the remaining 26%."<br><br>-> This mean __accommodation is only part__ of that 26%, - not all of it. Therefore, it's __FALSE__ to say 26% is for accommodation alone. |
| 11       | NOT GIVEN    | TRUE          | STATEMENT: Visitors to New Zealand like to become involved in the local culture.<br><br>The text clearly states: "...visitors enjoy cultural activities most when they are interactive..."<br><br>This directly confirms the statement. So the answer is __TRUE__                                                                                                                                                                      |

At QUESTION 10. I  feels TRUE because the word 'related' , i think i can choose TRUE.

When read the statement, I thought that: “Accommodation is **related** to 26% of satisfaction” → meaning it's **included** in that 26%.

I saw the word __related to__, which seems close to __account for__, and I know __accommodation is part of__ that 26%.

But the key logic problem:

- The statement claims: all 26% is related to accommodation.
- The text says: transport AND accommodation together account for 26%.

So, accommodation is related.

But not __all of the 26%__ is related to accommodation.

::: {.callout-tip}
If a statement __overstates__ or __exaggerates__ what's in the text - even a little - the answer is __FALSE__, not TRUE

Trick:

When a stement __splits combined data__ and __assigns it all to just one element__, it's __FALSE__.

|Passage says:|Statement says:|Verdict|
|---|---|---|
|A + B = 26%|Only A = 26%|❌ FALSE|

> “Is the statement giving **partial information** as if it were **complete**?”

If **yes**, it’s likely **FALSE**.
:::

## Some statement to test the instinct:

A recent study on international students found that **70% of them were satisfied with the quality of teaching**, while **30% mentioned issues with accommodation and cost of living.**  
The report also highlighted that **students prefer studying in cities with strong public transport systems** and **cultural diversity**.

**1.** 70% of international students were satisfied with both teaching and accommodation.  
A. TRUE  
B. FALSE  
C. NOT GIVEN

**2.** Cost of living is a concern for 30% of international students.  
A. TRUE  
B. FALSE  
C. NOT GIVEN

**3.** Students tend to avoid cities without good public transport.  
A. TRUE  
B. FALSE  
C. NOT GIVEN


1B, just teaching
2B, in include accommodation
3C, i dont see that information (it is assuming of the sentence ..)

**Why:** The passage says students **“prefer cities with strong public transport”**, but that **doesn't mean** they _avoid_ places without it. IELTS needs **clear evidence**, not assumptions. So this is **NOT GIVEN**.

| 28       | D. It will lead to a deterioration in human ability | C. It undermines a fundamental human quality | Geraint Wiggins says, "They are worried that it is taking something special away from that it means to be human" -> That's __undermining a fundamental human quality__ like creativity. |
| 31       | D. highlights the technical limitations             | A. achieves a particularly striking effect   | “...thanks to a technical glitch. This gives the work an _eerie, ghostlike quality_.” → This is **praise** for its visual effect, not criticism.                                        |

At question 28

You read that people were "worried" about computer art and assumed this was because **humans might become worse** at art or creativity — a _decline in human ability_.

This is a **reasonable guess**, but IELTS doesn’t test guesses. You must match ideas _exactly_.

> _“They are worried that it is taking something special away from what it means to be human.”_

That “**something special**” is clearly **human creativity**, which is described as a **core human trait**. So the concern isn’t about becoming **worse** at art; it’s about **losing what makes us unique**.

- **Option D** implies a **skill-level decline** — like artists becoming lazy or less creative.
    
- **Option C** talks about **existential value** — human creativity as a part of _our identity_.

At question 31 

The chair paintings are an example of computer art which...

My Answer:

**D.** highlights the technical limitations of the software

 Correct Answer:

**A.** achieves a particularly striking effect

You saw the phrase “**technical glitch**” and thought it showed a **limitation**, which is logical on the surface.

But...

---

### 🔍 What the Text Actually Says (Paragraph 4):

> _“Some of the Painting Fool’s paintings of a chair came out in black and white, thanks to a technical glitch. **This gives the work an eerie, ghostlike quality.**”_

That sentence **praises** the accidental result — it talks about **artistic effect** (eerie, ghostlike), not technical failure.

***

- Watch out for **emotional reactions** in the text → they help answer YES/NO and MCQs
    
- Don’t **overinterpret negatives** (e.g. glitches aren't always bad!)
    
- In MCQ, try **paraphrasing each option** and matching to the passage exactly
    
- Practice identifying the **writer’s tone and hidden opinion** (especially in paragraph 1 or conclusion)

# IELTS Speaking Test Simulation

## Part 1: Introduction & Interview

### Topic: Leisure & Free Time (linked to boredom & stimulation)

#### Q1. What do you like to do in your free time?

_In my spare time, I usually try to disconnect from digital distractions and engage in more meaningful activities, like journaling or reading. I've notice that when I'm bored, instead of resorting to overstimulation like social media, I try to embrace the boredom-it's surprisingly stimulating and often sparks creative ideas._

#### Q2. Do you often feel bored?

_Yes, I do from time to time. But I've learned that boredom, especially what psychologists call indifferent boredom, can be a gateway to creativity. Rather than seeing it as a negative state, I treat it as a signal that I need to re-engage with something mentally rewarding._

#### Q3. What kind of things make people bored easily these days ?

_Honestly, I think it's our over-connected lifestyle. There's so much passive consumption -videos, scrolling, noise - that it paradoxically leads to a lack of meaningful engagement. When activities feel purposeless or repetitive, people fall into a state of apathy of reactant boredom, which is quite destructive._

### Topic: EDUCATION & LEARNING

#### Q1. What subject did you enjoy most at school?

_I really enjoyed ~~literature~~ mathematics because it allowed me to express my thoughts creatively. I found that when the class was engaging, I was less likely to feel bored or distracted. It's like what researchers say-when we feel meaningfully involved, boredom is less likely to set in._

#### Q2. What kind of teacher do you prefer?

_I prefer teachers who can make the subject come alive. Someone who sparks curiosity and encourages active learning rather than passive memorization. I think the worst thing is when a class becomes repetitive-it leads to apathy and disengagement._

#### Q3. Do you prefer studying alone or with others?

_That depends. For deep reading or writing, I prefer to study alone so I can concentrate. But for brainstorming or practicing speaking skills, studying with others can make the experience more dynamic and stimulating._

## Part 2: INDIVIDUAL LONG TURN

**Cue Card: Describe a creative activity you enjoy doing.**

> You should say:
> 
> - What the activity is
>     
> - How you learned it
>     
> - Why you enjoy it
>     
> - And explain how it helps you express yourself

_One creative activity I've come to enjoy deeply is writing short stories. I began doing it during university, especially during those quiet moments of indifferent boredom when I felt mentally under-stimulated. Strangely, boredom sparked my imagination, letting my mind wander freely. I believe creativity often flourishes in those conditions. Writing allows me to explore ideas and emotions I can't always express verbally. Sometimes I think of it like programming imagination into words, similar to how artificial intelligence tools like the Painting Fool are programmed to generate art. But unlike machines, my creativity stems from real emotional experiences. That personal input makes it fulfilling and cathartic._

**Cue Card: Describe an educational experience that was especially important for you.**

> You should say:
> 
> - What it was

> - When it happened
>     
> - What you learned from it
>     
> - And explain why it was important to you

_One of the most memorable educational experiences I've had was attending a creativity workshop during high school. It was organized to help students break away from rigid academic routines and think outside the box. We weren't given clear instructions- instead, we had to solve a real-world problem in teams. Initially, some of us felt a bit of 'calibrating boredom', unsure of what to do, but that actually pushed us to explore ideas more creatively. That session taught me that boredom isn't necessarily negative- it can push us to innovate when we're given freedom._
 
## Part 3: Two-way discussion

### Theme: Creativity & Technology 

#### Q1. Do you think computers can be truly creative?

_It's a fascinating question. Computers can simulate creativity through algorithms, like the Painting Fool or EMI composer program. But in my opinion, what they produce still lacks emotional depth. As one researcher put it, computer-generated art often lacks an irresistible essence because we know it wasn't born out of genuine human experience or emotion._

#### Q2. Why do some people dislike art made by machines?

_I think it's partly due to prejudice and partly because people value the effort and thought behind a piece. Studies show that when people think a human created the art, they perceive it as more meaningful. When the same art is labeled as machine-generated, the emotional connection is undermined._

#### Q3. How important is creativity in education and work?

_Extremely important. In education, fostering creativity helps students move beyond memorization and into real problem-solving. In the workplace, creative thinking leads to innovation. Ironically, even as machines become more advanced, it's our human creativity they still can't supersede. That remains our most valuable trait._

### Theme: The Role of Education in Creativity and Motivation

#### Q1. Do schools do enough to encourage creativity?

_In many cases, no. Education systems still prioritize exam results and memorization. While that ensures standardization, it often neglects skills like problem-solving and imagination. To truly foster creativity, schools need to incorporate more open-ended tasks and allow room for failure._

#### Q2. How can teachers keep students motivated in class?

_Teachers can make learning more engaging by connecting topics to real-life applications. Also, varying teaching methods-such as using visuals, stories, or group activities- can help. Most importantly, they should encourage questions and curiosity rather than just delivering information._

#### Q3. Is boredom always a bad thing in education?

_Not necessarily. Some psychologists argue that indifferent boredom or low-stimulation moments can actually trigger imagination. If managed correctly, it can lead to new ideas. However, constant boredom caused by uninspiring lessons is definitely counterproductive._

| 17  | C - too much effort                     | B - loss of confidence,      | You matched the idea of effort to the __first point__, but missed that the speaker is actually talking about __losing belief__ and __giving up hope__ ‚Äî that's about confidence, not effort.<br> | ‚ÄúI think people lose interest when they __don't think they're making enough progress__. That's when they __give up hope__ and stop believing they'll ever achieve their goals.<br><br>                            |
| 18  | E - feeling less successful than others | C - too much effort required | You misread the second part. The speaker says it takes ‚Äúa lot of determination and hard work‚Äù ‚Äì this clearly points to ‚Äútoo much effort‚Äù, not comparing oneself to others.                       | Also, what people sometimes don't realize when they __start is that it takes a lot of determination and hard work__ to keep training week after week, and lots of people __don't have that kind of commitment__.‚Äù |

Q17 ‚Äì ‚Äú...when they don't think they're making enough progress...give up hope...stop believing...‚Äù
- these phrases are all about __losing confidence or motivation__.
- Correct answer: B - loss of confidence
Q18 ‚Äì ‚Äú...takes a lot of determination and hard work...lots of people don't have that kind of commitment.‚Äù
- this is about the __effort and long-term dedication__ needed.
- Correct answer C - too much effort required.
üí° Why You Missed It:

- You swapped the ideas: You took ‚Äúhard work‚Äù and applied it to Q17, but that part comes second.

- In IELTS MCQs, the order of the ideas usually matches the order of the questions.

- You may have guessed based on vocabulary, not on exact function and meaning.

Loss of confidence - lose hope
too much effort required - too hard to continue
feeling less successful than others - comparing yourself to another

### Turning them into speaking

#### Do you often use public transport
Not really. I usually go by bike because it's quicker and more convenient for me. I'm lucky - my office isn't far from where I live, so I hardly ever need to use buses or trains. But when I do, I'd say the transport links in my area are decent.

#### Do you enjoy shopping in your local area?
Yes, I do! There's a brand new shopping mall that opened just a couple of months ago. It's not too expensive either, so I can usually find something reasonable. I've definitely been going there more often lately.

#### How often do you travel for work or study?

These days, I only need to go into the city one or two days a week. Most of the time I work from home. I really appreciate that flexibility - it saves me time and money.

#### Do you like your neighborhood?
Yes, I really like it. It's a quite area with good transport links and a lovely park nearby. The school here is one of the best in the country, and we also have a great hospital. I've been living here for a few years, and I've never had any problems.

#### Do you like going to the cinema?
Absolutely. There's a brand new cinema in the city center - it's only bene open a couple of months. I'll definitely have a look this weekend. A friend told me it's really modern and comfortable.

#### Do you often meet friends in your free time?
I try to. If they're free after work, I could meet them for dinner or coffee. Thursday is usually better for me because I finish early. Really appreciate any time I get to catch up with them.

#### Describe a place in your local area that you like to visit.
You should say:
- what the place is
- where it is located
- how often you go there
- and explain why you enjoy going there

One place I enjoy visiting in my local area is a small park in the suburb where I live. It's not a huge park, but it's peaceful and well-kept, and I've been going there for years. 
The park is just a 10-minutes walk from my home, and it's next to a lovely little cafe. You can't miss it - it's right opposite the new cinema that's only been open a couple of months. I usually go there after work, maybe one or two days a week, just to unwind.

What I love most is how quiet it is. There's hardly any traffic around, and it's never crowded. I go by bike, which is really convenient, and it's a great way to get a bit of exercise. Sometimes I take a book and it on a bench, or just enjoy walking around.

I think it's only the best things about my neighborhood. It's not too expensive to live here, the transport links are good, and places like this park make it even better. I really appreciate having a relaxing spot so close to home.

#### Do you think it's important to have public places in cities?
Absolutely. I think public places like parks or community centers are essential in cities. They offer people space to relax and socialize, especially in areas where most people live in apartments. For example, the park near my house isn't too expensive to maintain, but it really adds value to the neighborhood. I've been going there for years, and it's always full of life - families, joggers, even students reading under the trees.

#### Why do people prefer to go to parks rather than shopping centers?

I think it depends on what they're looking for. Parks are quiet and peaceful, and they're usually free, while shopping centers can be noisy and crowded. A lot of people are put off by the idea of spending money every time they go out, so they prefer to visit a park instead. Personally, I go by bike to my local park - it's great exercise and doesn't cost a thing. You should be able to enjoy your free time without spending a lot.

#### What are the benefits of having local amenities close to home?

There are so many benefits. First, it saves time. If there's a good school or a hospital nearby, that's one less thing to worry about. For instance, in my area, we have one of the best hospitals in the country, and I really appreciate having it so close. There's also a brand new cinema that's only been open for a couple of months. It's nice to have everything within walking distance - you can definitely tell that people feel more connected to their community.

#### How has the use of public spaces changed in recent years?
I think people are using public spaces more now, especially after the pandemic. There's more focus on outdoor activities, mental health, and work-life balance. A lot of people work from home one or two days a week now, so they have more time to enjoy places like parks or cafes. It's also become more common for local councils to invest in public areas because they've realized how much people value them.

### Turning them into Speaking

#### Do you do any physical exercise ?
Yes, I try to stay active. I used to go to the gym, but honestly, fitting a visit into my busy day was a bit difficult. These days, I prefer cycling in the park. It's fun, and being out in the fresh air really helps me relax. I also enjoy in because it keeps me fit without feeling like a chore.

#### Do you prefer indoor or outdoor activities?
I definitely prefer outdoor activities. I find going for a run or a bike ride much more enjoyable than being stuck in a gym. The fresh air and scenery make it feel less like exercise. But I"ll admit - if the weather's bad, I skip it. Only real fanatics go out in the wind and rain!

#### What do you think about personal trainers?
I think they can be really helpful, especially for beginners. Having someone there to encourage you can help you achieve your goals can really boost motivation. The only downside is the cost - personal trainers can be expensive, and not everyone can afford that.

#### Describe a physical activity you enjoy.
*You should say:

what the activity is

where and when you do it

who you do it with

and explain why you enjoy it.*

One physical activity I really enjoy is swimming. I usually go to an indoor pool near my house, which means I can swim any time of year regardless of the weather. I often go after work, and sometimes my friend joins me.

What I like most about swimming is that it's great for building fitness, but it's also quite gentle on the body. It works all the muscles without putting too much strain on the joints. That said, it can be a bit solitary - you can't exactly have a chat while swimming laps!

Still, I find it really relaxing and satisfying. It clears my mind and keeps me in shape. I've also set some small goals for myself, like increasing how many laps I can do, which helps me stay motivated.

#### Why do some people enjoy physical exercise more than others?
I think it depends on their personality and past experience. Some people enjoy exercise because they've built a habit and can see the progress they're making, which keeps them motivated. Others might find it hard because they don't feel any improvement at first, so they lost interest and give up. Also, if someone isn't very flexible or physically confident, even simple exercises like yoga can feel surprisingly challenging.

#### Do you think people today get enough physical activity?
Honestly, I don't think most people do. Many lead very busy lives, and fitting a workout into their schedule can be tough. Even if they join a gym, they often stop going after a few weeks. It takes a lot of determination and commitment to keep exercising regularly, especially if you're not seeing immediate results.

#### What can people do to stay motivated to exercise regularly?
One effective way is to set manageable goals. If people aim too high at the beginning, they might feel overwhelmed and give up. Having flexible targets, rewarding yourself when you reach a goal, or even exercising with a friend can make it more enjoyable and sustainable. Getting a personal trainer can also help, but that comes with a significant cost.

#### Is it better to do exercise indoors or outdoors?
It depends on personal preference. Some people enjoy running or cycling outdoors because it gives them a sense of freedom and they get to enjoy the fresh air. Others prefer the gym or indoor pools where the environment is controlled, especially during bad weather. Personally, I find outdoor exercise more refreshing, as long as the conditions are right - I'm definitely not a fan of running in the rain.

### Turning them into speaking

#### Do you enjoy working on creative projects ?
Yes, I've always been interested in creative things, especially anything to do with colour. A while ago, I did a project where I experimented with natural dyes to colour fabrics like cotton and wool. It was quite hands-on - a real practical investigation - and even thought i was time-consuming, I found it fascinating.

#### Have you ever made something by hand?
Actually, yes. I once made some natural dyes myself as part of a textile design project. I thought it would just be a matter of using a teaspoon or so, but I ended up needing a whole pile of beetroot just to get a bit of colour. It took longer than I expected, but i was worth it.

#### Do you enjoy doing experiments?
I do, especially when there's a creative element involved. I remember doing an experiment with different types of fabric - like cotton, wool, and nylon - to see how they reacted to natural and artificial dyes. I'd been going to test just one fibre at first, but then I decided to include more for comparison.

#### Do you often try new things?
Yes, I like following up on things that catch my interest. For example, I once visited an exhibition and saw a display of colorful textiles, which inspired me to research natural dyes. I even found a great book about a botanic garden that specialises in dye-producing plants.

#### Are you interested in art of design?

Definitely. I love anything visual. I once studied a dye called Tyrian purple, which was worn in ancient times by royalty because it was so rare. I didn't use it in my project, though - it would've cost a fortune.

#### Describe a project or piece of work you did, either at school or at home.
You should say:
- what the project was

- why you did it

- how you did it

- and explain how you felt about doing it

One of the most interesting projects I've ever done was a textile design assignment during my final year at university. I've always been interested in colour and design, so I chose to focus on how natural dyes could be used to color fabrics like cotton and wool.
The idea actually came from a carpet shop I visited years ago when I was on holiday with my family in Turkey. I still remember all the amazing colours, and it really stuck with me. Later, I visited exhibition at a museum, and that gave me even more ideas. I decided to follow it up for my project.
The project included a practical investigation, which meant I had to prepare and test various dyes on different types of fabric - cotton, wool, and nylon. At first, I was going to use just one fibre, but I changed my mind so I could make some comparisons. I used both ready-made dyes and homemade ones. For example, I tried using beetroot, but it was more difficult than I thought. I had to chop up a whole pile of it just to get a little bit of dye, and even then, the colour wasn't as strong as I'd hoped. It ended up being a kind of watery cream shade on the wool, which was disappointing.
Despite the challenges, I really enjoyed doing the project. It was creative, and I learned a lot - not just about fabrics, but also about how to plan and carry out an investigation. It took longer than I expected, but I felt proud of the final results.

#### Do you think students learn more from doing projects or from traditional classes?
I believe students often learn more from doing hands-on projects. When they're actively involved in a practical investigation, like testing variables or creating something from scratch, they tend to remember the experience better. For example, when I made my own natural dyes for a design project, I ended up learning much more than I would have by just reading about the process in a textbook. It encourages creativity and independent thinking.

#### What kind of projects are most beneficial for young people ?
I think the most useful projects are the ones that combine creativity and real-world skills. For instance, projects that involve planning, researching, or experimenting with different materials can teach valuable problem-solving skills. If young people can follow up on something they're genuinely interested in-whether it's science, design, or business - they're more likely to stay motivated and take ownership of their learning.

#### Should schools focus more on academic subjects or creative activities?
Ideally, there should be a balance. Academic subjects are important, of course, but creative activities help students develop other types of intelligence- like emotional awareness, visual thinking, or innovation. In my opinion, creative projects like art, music, or even textile design allow students to express themselves and discover talents they might not explore in regular academic classes.

#### What challenges do people face when working on creative projects?
One big challenge is time. Creative projects often take longer than expected. I remember thinking that dyeing fabric with natural ingredients would be simple, but I ended up needing a whole pile of beetroot just to get a weak color. Another issue is uncertainty-you don't always know what the outcome will be. That can be discouraging if things don't go as planned, especially if the materials cost a fortune.

#### Why do some people give up on creative hobbies or projects?
Many people stop because they don't see quick results. It takes a lot of commitment and patience to stick with something that doesn't turn out perfectly the first time. Some might also abandon their projects if they lack proper guidance. For instance, without a good mentor or tutor, it's easy to feel lost. Also, creative work can be expensive-materials, tools, or even time investment can be hard to maintain.

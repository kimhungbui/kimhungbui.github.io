| 17  | C - too much effort                     | B - loss of confidence,      | You matched the idea of effort to the __first point__, but missed that the speaker is actually talking about __losing belief__ and __giving up hope__ ‚Äî that's about confidence, not effort.<br> | ‚ÄúI think people lose interest when they __don't think they're making enough progress__. That's when they __give up hope__ and stop believing they'll ever achieve their goals.<br><br>                            |
| 18  | E - feeling less successful than others | C - too much effort required | You misread the second part. The speaker says it takes ‚Äúa lot of determination and hard work‚Äù ‚Äì this clearly points to ‚Äútoo much effort‚Äù, not comparing oneself to others.                       | Also, what people sometimes don't realize when they __start is that it takes a lot of determination and hard work__ to keep training week after week, and lots of people __don't have that kind of commitment__.‚Äù |

üí° Why You Missed It:

- You swapped the ideas: You took ‚Äúhard work‚Äù and applied it to Q17, but that part comes second.

- In IELTS MCQs, the order of the ideas usually matches the order of the questions.

- You may have guessed based on vocabulary, not on exact function and meaning.

Loss of confidence - lose hope
too much effort required - too hard to continue
feeling less successful than others - comparing yourself to another

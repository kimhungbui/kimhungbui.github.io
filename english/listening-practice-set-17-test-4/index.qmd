# Cambridge IELTS 17 - listening test 2




# Performance Summary


# Recording 4

## **What went wrong & how to fix it**

  

**Q36 — evidence (you wrote “evident”)**

- **Why:** After “no ___ that…”, English requires a **noun**, not an adjective.
    
- **Collocation:** “no **evidence** that …” is the natural pair.
    
- **Mini rule:** If you hear “no / some / much / little ___ that…”, expect a **noun** (_evidence, proof, indication_).
    
- **Word-form pairs to remember:** evidence (n) vs. evident (adj); confidence vs. confident; intelligence vs. intelligent.
    

  

**Q37 — destinations (you wrote “destination”)**

- **Why:** The script says “Little was known about the **actual destinations** of particular species and **how they travelled there**.” Also the note line reads “about the **___ and journeys**”, which signals **parallel plurals**.
    
- **Mini rule:** When a blank is coordinated with another **plural** (“X **and** journeys”), make **both plural**.
    

  

**Q38 — oceans (you wrote “ocean”)**

- **Why:** The lecture uses the collocation “over **vast oceans**.” IELTS often tests the faint **-s** at word ends.
    
- **Mini rule:** Quantifiers like **vast**, **huge stretches of**, and references to large areas often take the **plural** (_oceans, mountains, forests_). Listen for the final /z/ sound.
    

  

**Q40 — atlas (you wrote “atlat”)**

- **Why:** Simple letter transposition under time pressure. The line was “In 1931, **an atlas** was published…”.
    
- **Mini rule:** Use the **article cue**: “**an** atlas” → vowel sound → _atlas_. When you hear an article + noun, lock in the standard spelling you know.


## **Fast repair drills (15–30 seconds each)**

  

Say these aloud, then write the missing word exactly:

1. There had been **no  that** storks migrate to Africa. → **evidence**
    
2. Little was known about birds’ actual **____** and journeys. → **destinations**
    
3. Small birds weighing only a few grams could still fly over vast **____**. → **oceans**
    
4. In 1931, **an ____** of European bird migration was published. → **atlas**

## **Micro-skills to prevent these errors on test day**

1. **Grammar slot check (Word form):**
    
    - After _no / little / much + ___ + that…_ → **noun**.
        
    
2. **Parallelism scan (Number):**
    
    - If the other half is plural (“X **and** journeys”), make your blank plural too.
        
    
3. **End-sound focus (Plural -s):**
    
    - Train your ear for the soft **/z/** at the end (oceans, destinations). Shadow-read transcripts to feel the endings.
        
    
4. **Article cue for spelling:**
    
    - “**a/an + noun**” often signals a common, dictionary form you already know. Use the article to sanity-check spelling (an **atlas**).

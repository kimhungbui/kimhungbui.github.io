final position: balance is best - engage with both, but international exposure is essential for broader personal growth


In many countries, there is an ongoing debate about whether people should focus on reading books from their own nation or whether exploring international literature is more beneficial. While literature from one's own country certainly has value, I believe that reading works from around the world provides wider benefits for personal development and understanding.

It is true that local literature plays an important role in preserving culture and identity. Stories written by authors from one's own country often reflect national history, traditions, and social values. By reading these works, individuals gain a deeper understanding of their heritage, which can strengthen a sense of belonging and connection to their community. Moreover, local literature is usually written in a familiar language, which makes it easier for readers to engage with the content and appreciate the subtleties of style and expression. For younger generations, these books provide knowledge of historical events and societal norms, ensuring that important cultural lessons are not forgotten.

Nevertheless, reading international literature offers benefits that local works alone cannot provide. Exposure to stories from different countries allows readers to develop empathy and a broader understanding of diverse cultures. International literature can present social issues, moral dilemmas, and everyday experiences that are entirely different from one's own, encouraging critical thinking and reflection. Additionally, such reading fosters creativity, as comparing different societies and styles challenges assumptions and expands the imagination. In today's increasingly interconnected world, having a global perspective is essential, and international literature is an effective way to achieve this.

In conclusion, while books from one's own country are valuable for preserving identity and cultural knowledge, reading international works offers a broader understanding of humanity and encourages personal growth. Therefore, I would argue that a balanced approach is ideal: people should read both local and global literature, but international exposure should play a central role in fostering a well-rounded worldview.

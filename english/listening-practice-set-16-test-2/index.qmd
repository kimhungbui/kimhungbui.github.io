# Performance Summary

| **Q#** | **Error Type**        | **Weakness**                         | **Fix**                                   |
| ------ | --------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| 11     | MCQ distractor        | Matching keywords instead of meaning | Pre-mark differences, focus on paraphrase |
| 12     | MCQ distractor        | Lost context from Q11                | Mentally lock each answer before moving   |
| 16     | Matching decision     | Not catching final choice            | Listen for decision signals               |
| 27     | Flow chart completion | Missed plural, predicted wrong form  | Train plural prediction + endings         |

## **Q11 & Q12 – Likely Listening Part 2**

  

**Type:** Multiple choice (details about a talk / instructions)

**Skills tested:**

- Recognising paraphrase in distractors
    
- Listening for _specific details_ rather than topic words
    
- Maintaining focus during fast option switches
    

  

**Common reasons for mistakes:**

- **Distractor trap:** The speaker may mention _all_ the options, but only one is true for the context.
    
- **Over-reliance on key words:** You may have matched words in the audio directly to the option rather than the meaning.
    
- **Losing track in double-question format:** When 2 MCQs come together (like Q11–12), if you miss one small detail for Q11, it can throw off Q12 as well.
    

  

**Fix:**

1. Train to **underline key differences** between options before audio starts.
    
2. Expect _paraphrase_ — options often use synonyms (e.g., “easy to reach” = “accessible”).
    
3. Pause after each answer in practice to mentally “lock” it before moving on.

## **Q16 – Likely Listening Part 2 or 3**

  

**Type:** Matching / table completion (short answer)

**Skills tested:**

- Mapping speakers’ ideas to given categories
    
- Distinguishing between similar-sounding items
    
- Understanding **speaker opinion** vs. factual description
    

  

**Common reasons for mistakes:**

- **Misidentifying speaker’s final decision** — they may consider an option, reject it, then choose another.
    
- **Following the wrong speaker** in a multi-speaker part.
    
- Hearing _two possible answers_ but not catching the conclusion phrase like _“OK, let’s do that”_.
    

  

**Fix:**

- Listen for **decision signals**: “Let’s go with…”, “We’ve decided on…”, “Forget that idea…”.
    
- In practice, cover the script and re-listen only for _final decisions_.
    

---

## **Q27 – Listening Part 3 Flow Chart**

  

**Question:** “Check ethical guidelines for working with (27) …” → Correct answer: **humans/people**

  

**Likely reason for mistake:**

- **Plural/singular issue** — you said earlier you tend to miss plural endings in fast speech.
    
- Possibly misheard as “human research” or “human testing” and didn’t think of the base form “humans.”
    
- You might have expected a **field/area** (like “psychology” or “participants”) instead of the subject of the research.
    

  

**Fix:**

1. For plural prediction:
    
    - After “working with…”, ask: _Are they referring to a countable group?_ If yes → expect plural (humans, students, patients).
        
    
2. In listening, watch for **/z/ or /s/** endings even when very soft.
    
3. Do “plural ending dictation” drills — play 1–2 second clips, write only the last word, mark plural/singular.

| Q   | I choose | Correct                               | **Why the correct one wins**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | **Classic trap words**                                      |
| --- | -------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 11  | B        | **C** (local council building)        | Text says: _“…intended as his family home,_ **_but_** _he died… His heir sold it to the local council,_ **_who turned it into offices_**_. A later plan to convert it into a tourist info centre_ **_didn’t happen_**_.”_ → What it **used to be** before becoming a school = **council offices**. | intended, plan, didn’t come about, instead                  |
| 12  | C        | **B** (lower school site → new homes) | _“The lower school will move to_ **_new buildings on the main site_**_. Developers will_ **_construct houses on the existing lower school site_**_.”_ → New school buildings aren’t on the lower site; they’re on the **main** site.                                                               | site names (main vs lower), will move to, will construct on |
| 16  | **C**    | **D** (daily change)                  | _“World Adventures…_ **_a different country’s cuisine each day_**_… menus_ **_planned for a week_**_.”_ “Planned for a week” ≠ “changes weekly.” The **change is daily**; the **plan** is weekly.                                                                                                  | each day vs planned for a week                              |

## **What to listen for (and how not to get faked out)**

1. **Timeline pivots**
    
    - _intended/planned to_ = idea only, not reality.
        
    - _didn’t come about/instead/but_ = negates the tempting option and points to the real one.
        
    
2. **Location precision**
    
    - Map the nouns: **main site** ≠ **lower school site**. When you hear construction/moving, anchor **what is moving** and **to/from which site**.
        
    
3. **Frequency decoder**
    
    - _each/every day_ → **daily**.
        
    - _each/every week_ → **weekly**.
        
    - _planned for a week_ → schedule visibility, **not** frequency of change.
        
    

  

## **Micro-drills (train your ear)**

- “It was **meant to be** a museum, **but** it **became** a library.” → **Used to be**: library.
    
- “Menus are **planned weekly**, with a **different cuisine each day**.” → Frequency: **daily** change.
    
- “The annex **will move to** the north campus; the old annex site **will become housing**.” → Housing on **old annex site**, not north campus.
    

  

## **Mini checklist for Part 2 MCQ**

- Underline negators: **but / however / instead / didn’t happen**.
    
- Circle place words: **main / lower / north / south**.
    
- Box frequency words: **each day / weekly / planned for a week**.
    
- Ask: “Are they stating a **past intention** or a **past reality**?”

### **What happened on Q27**

- **Audio line:** “because our experiment involves **humans**, so there are special regulations.”
    
- **Question stem:** “Check ethical guidelines for **working with (27) ____**”
    
- **Your answer:** human (singular)
    
- **Required form:** humans (plural) — people is also accepted.
    

  

### **Why your answer was marked wrong**

- **Grammar cue:** The preposition **with** + a **countable noun** describing participants almost always takes the **plural** in this context: _with humans / with people / with participants_.
    
- **Echoing rule (IELTS Listening):** For gap‑fills, you must write **the word(s) you hear**. The speaker clearly says **humans**. Even if you miss the final /z/ sound, the stem “working **with** …” strongly signals a plural head noun.
    

  

### **How to avoid this mistake next time**

1. **Track number in the audio.** If you hear _humans/people/participants_, write the plural.
    
2. **Use the stem as a safety net.** After **with**, ask: “Would singular sound natural?” → _with human_ ❌, _with humans_ ✅.
    
3. **Listen for plural markers around the blank:**
    
    - Earlier sentence: “our experiment **involves humans**” → primes a plural repeat.
        
    
4. **Don’t ‘correct’ the audio.** IELTS isn’t testing synonyms here; it’s testing recall of the heard word(s) in correct form.
    

  

### **Micro‑drill (10 seconds)**

  

Fill the blank with singular/plural you’d expect from the stem (answers below):

1. guidelines for working with < >______
    
2. consent from the ______ < > guardian
    
3. data from ______< > participant
    
4. risks to ______ < > subjects
    
5. interviews with ______ <> student
    

1 humans

2 legal

3 each

4 human (adj)

5 each 



**Answers:** 1) **humans/people** (plural) 2) **legal** (adj) 3) **each** (singular cue) 4) **human** (adj before noun) **subjects** (plural) 5) **each** (singular cue) **student**

  

> Notice how **with + people** tends to be plural, while **human** before a noun is often an **adjective** (e.g., _human subjects_), which flips the number decision to the noun (_subjects_ → plural).

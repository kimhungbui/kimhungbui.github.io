# What are topic sentence ?
The standard essay structure for a IELTS Task 2 essay is four paragraphs - an introduction, two body paragraphs and a conclusion.

The topic sentence is the first sentence of each body paragraph.
It tells the examiner the main idea of the paragraph so it functions like a mini introduction.

# Why are Topic Sentences Important?
Good topic sentences help to make our paragraphs clear and easy to read. 

As we can see from the table below, clear paragraphs really help our coherence and cohesion score.

# How to Write a Good Topic Sentence ?

A good topic sentence should be clear and simple.

A basic topic sentence has two parts:
1. The topic.
2. The reason / main idea.
![[18920776_935567866585887_4103732896360495495_o-768x575.jpg]]

**Example Question**

	Global warming/Climate change are pressing problems that every country and the world will have to deal with in the future.
	What are the causes of global warming ?
	What are some possible solutions ?

**Body paragraph 1 (the main cause of global warming)**
Topic: the main cause of global warming
Reason/ main idea: mass consumption of fossil fuels

So the topic sentence is:
	The main cause of climate change is the mass consumption of fossil fuels.

**Body paragraph 2 (a possible solution)**

Topic: one possible solution for dealing with global warming
Reason/main idea: higher taxes on automobiles

The topic sentence is:
	One possible solution for dealing with climate change could be higher taxes on automobiles.

# Topic sentence will help us to stay married to one main idea.

As we saw in the table above, we should "present a clear central topic within each paragraph". This means each body paragraph should be focused on just one main idea.

Therefore planning for our topic sentences helps us to decide what is the main idea for that paragraph.

After that we should ONLY think of support for that idea. We are married to that main idea. We can't cheat on it with another main idea.

So for the following topic sentence, we should only discuss the mass consumption of fuels.

	The main cause of climate change is the mass consumption of fossil fuels.

Some students spend nearly the whole paragraph discussing one main idea.
But then near the end, they seem to panic or get overexcited, and suddenly add a second unrelated idea e.g. deforestation or methane emissions from animals.
This is a very common mistake but as the table above showed this will lower our coherence and cohesion score.
Remember each paragraph can only have "one central topic".
As part of our planning stage in the task 2 writing exam, we should write down our topic sentences.
This will make it easier when we start writing our essay to keep our supporting ideas clear, and focused on our main idea.
If we accidentally include a second main idea at the end - cross it out. Stay focused.


# How to Practice Topic Sentences

## Analyze sample essays
1. Look at some task 2 sample essays.
2. Highlight the topic sentence(s) - what is the topic? What is the main idea?
3. Read the body paragraph(s) - do all the supporting ideas relate to that idea?

## Practice writing topic sentences for sample essays
1. Look at some task 2 sample essay.
2. Cover up the first sentence of the body paragraph(s).
3. Read the body again - what is the topic and main idea ?
4. Write a topic sentence for that paragraph, then compare it with the original one.
## Analyze our own writing
1. Look back through our old task 2 essays.
2. Are the topic sentences good? If not, write new ones.
## Practice writing topic sentences for new question
1. Look at some sample task 2 question (there is one below)
2. Analyze the question and brainstorm main ideas.
3. Choose the main topic and main idea for each body paragraph.
4. Write our topic sentences.

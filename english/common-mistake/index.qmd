We use _the_
- with countries or places where the name refers to a group of islands or states: <font color="#00b050">the United States, the Middle East, the United Arab Emirates, the UK.</font>
- with superlatives: <font color="#00b050">the best, the longest, the highest</font>
- with cardinal numbers: <font color="#00b050">the first, the second, the third</font>
- when there is only one in the world: <font color="#00b050">the environment, the internet, the sun</font>
- to refer to the only one in this particular are: <font color="#00b050">the government, the police, the river</font>
- in the phrase: <font color="#00b050">the same as</font>

We don't use _the_
- With the single country or place: <font color="#00b050">America, England, China</font>
- to talk about something in general. We use the plural if we are talking about something in general; we use _the_ to identify one specific example. Compare:
  People with reading difficulties often have problem with numbers.

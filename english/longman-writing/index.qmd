Hello! I would like to introduce myself to you. My name is Hung, and I was born in Vietnam. My family has four people, my parents and my sister. I speak Vietnamese and professional English. I did my education at the University of Technology. My favorite subject was physics, but now I like mathematics more. I learned English to move to the US to pursue a PhD. My dream is to have a research job at Google. In my free time, I ride a bicycle, swim, and run.

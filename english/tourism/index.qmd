_The bar graph below show the number of tourists visiting two different cities by season. Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparison where relevant._


![](Pasted%20image%2020250625093819.png)
The bar chart compares the number of tourists (in thousands) who visited two cities, Dover and Troy, across the four seasons: Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter.

Overall, Dover saw a steady increase in tourist numbers throughout the year, peaking in winter, while Troy experienced the opposite trend, with numbers peaking in summer and then sharply declining by winter. The two cities demonstrated contrasting seasonal patterns in tourism. 

In spring, both cities received a similar number of tourists, with Dover attracting 5,000 and Troy slightly fewer at 4,800. However, during the summer months, Troy saw a dramatic surge to 23,000 visitors, more than double Dover's figures of 10,000. In autumn, while Troy has a slight decrease to 20,000 visitors, Dover hosts increasingly to 15,000 visitors.

In contrast, winter brought a complete reversal in patterns. Dover's tourist numbers peaked at 25,000, while Troy experienced a steep decline, drawing only 5,000 visitors - the lowest for the year. This stark contrast highlights Dover's strong winter appeal and Troy's reliance on summer tourism.

| Question | My answer | Corrected | ISSUE                                                                        |

| 8        | SWIMMING  | RUNNING   | Caught the first sport mentioned ("swimming") and wrote it down too quickly. |

> **JULIE:** _And do you do any other types of exercise?_

> **CARL:** _Yeah, I **sometimes do a little swimming**, but usually just when I’m on vacation. But normally I go **running a few times a week**, maybe three or four times._


### Keyword in the Question:

> _“… goes **regularly**…”_

- **"Sometimes"** and **"just when I'm on vacation"** = **NOT REGULAR** ⇒ ❌ _swimming_
    
- **"Go running a few times a week, maybe three or four times"** = ✅ **regular** ⇒ _running_
- 
- You may have **caught the first sport mentioned** (“swimming”) and wrote it down too quickly.
    
- This is a **common trap in IELTS Listening** – they give a **distractor (swimming)** before the **real answer (running)**.
    
- It tests your ability to **listen for the full context** and **understand frequency words** like “sometimes” vs “regularly”.

- Always **listen until the speaker finishes their full idea**.
    
- Be careful with contrast words like:  
    ➤ _but_, _however_, _actually_, _normally_, _usually_
    
- Practice listening for **frequency adverbs** (always, often, sometimes, rarely, etc.).

Q11:
Before Queen Elizabeth I visited the castle in 1576,

  
A. repairs were carried out to the quest rooms.

B. a new building was constructed for her.

C. a fire damaged part of the main hall.

transcript:

_"...it was beginning to look a bit run down, and it was decided that rather than repair the guest rooms, they’d make a new house for her out of wood next to the main hall."_  
_"...She stayed there for four nights... unfortunately it was destroyed a few years later by fire."_

- The fire happened after her visit, not before
- The option talks about __timing__, and IELTS tests this detail often.

- "...they'd make a new house for her ..." clearly matches "__a new building was constructed for her___".

:::{.callout-tip}
## Look out for __time references__:
- "before", "after", "by the time", "later", etc
They are __critical__ in eliminating distractors like C here.
:::

Q17: Bow and arrow display - where is it?

My confusion: I thought "__past__" = "__across the bridge__", but that's a common listening trap.

#### Transcript:

> _"...take the first left after the main entrance and follow the path past the bridge, then you’ll see it in front of you at the end."_

#### Why mistake happens:

- “**past the bridge**” = go **along the path** and **pass by** the bridge.
    
- It does **not mean cross the bridge**.

Words like **past**, **next to**, **near**, and **beyond** are **visual direction words**.  
Always **pause** to ask:

> 🔹 “Is the speaker saying go _over_ the bridge or just go _past_ it?”

### Words that Usually mean "GO OVER the Bridge"

| Phrase                                   | Meaning                                   |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Cross the bridge**                     | Walk/go over the bridge to the other side |
| **Go over the bridge**                   | Same — you're physically crossing it      |
| **Walk across the bridge**               | Same as above                             |
| **Head to the other side of the bridge** | Move across it completely                 |
| **Continue across the bridge**           | Emphasizes completing the crossing        |
| **Take the bridge**                      | Implies using it to go to the other side  |
| **Follow the path over the bridge**      | Path includes crossing the bridge         |
Examples:

- "Go over the bridge and you’ll see the stage on your right."
    
- "Continue across the bridge and turn left at the gate."
### Words That Mean "Go PAST the Bridge" (but do NOT cross it)

| Phrase                                           | Meaning                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Go past the bridge**                           | Walk near it, but stay on the same side         |
| **Walk alongside the bridge**                    | Stay next to it, not crossing                   |
| **Follow the path past the bridge**              | Continue in the same direction without crossing |
| **Go down the path beyond the bridge**           | Keep going, but still don’t cross               |
| **Before the bridge** / **Just past the bridge** | Still on the same side, near it                 |
| **Next to the bridge**                           | Located beside, not over it                     |
**Examples:**

- "Follow the path past the bridge and you’ll see the café at the end."
    
- "Don’t go over the bridge — the museum is just beside it."

They **may say both** in the same sentence:

> “Take the first left, follow the path **past the bridge**, and then **go over the small footbridge** on your right.”

✅ So always slow down when you hear **bridge**, and listen for clues:

- _“over”_, _“across”_, _“cross”_ → ❗Cross the bridge
    
- _“past”_, _“beside”_, _“along”_ → 🚫 Do NOT cross

| 23       | B. spread from the island to other areas | A. became isolated on the island. | Choose the answer too soon. (miss) |

other animals like bears were able to roam around the whole area.I think it mean speard, (oh not, the answer is 'spread from the __island__ to other areas'.

> “...St Paul’s Island wasn’t an island, it was connected to the mainland...  
> ...the climate warmed up and the sea level began to rise, and the island got cut off from the mainland.  
> So those mammoths on the island **couldn’t escape**; **they had to stay on the island**.”

🟢 **That’s a clear definition of becoming _isolated_.**

You chose:

> **B. Spread from the island to other areas.**

🔻 But the script says:

> “...they _had to stay_ on the island.”

They were **trapped**, not spreading.

| 31  | **dances**      | dancing     | **Form**            | You used the _-ing_ form. But only **noun (plural)** is accepted here.                  |
| 32  | **survival**    | survive     | **Word form**       | “Survive” is a verb. The sentence needs a noun: “ensure their survival.”                |
| 35  | **comets**      | cosmic      | **Wrong word**      | You guessed a related word, but the speaker said “comets” (a type of celestial object). |
| 37  | **instruments** | instrument  | **Singular/plural** | The plural **"instruments"** is correct as it refers to **multiple inventions**.        |
| 38  | **thermometer** | demometer   | **Spelling**        | Likely a hearing/spelling error. “Demometer” is not a word.                             |
| 39  | **storms**      | storm       | **Singular/plural** | The sentence uses **"storms"** in general. Plural is needed.                            |

| Word/Phrase        | Meaning                                      |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **weather gods**   | deities believed to control weather          |
| **rites / dances** | traditional ceremonies for worship or belief |
| **survival**       | continuing to live or exist                  |
| **phenomena**      | observable facts or events                   |

| **telegraph**      | device for sending messages electronically   |
|                    |                                              |
### Always check **grammatical form**:

> Look **before and after the gap**.  
> If the sentence says:  
> “to ensure their ___”  
> You know it requires a **noun**.

### Train yourself to recognize **plural forms**:

Words like:

- **storms**, **festivals**, **dances**, **instruments**  
    are often required in general statements.

### Spelling matters!

You can lose marks even with small spelling mistakes. Practice dictation and listen to endings like:

- **/s/** for plurals
    
- **/əd/** or **/t/** past participles
    
- Watch for soft vs. hard **c** and **t** sounds.

### IELTS SPEAKING IDEAS

#### PART 2: Describe a City You Know

Use:

- "It’s a coastal city built where a river meets the sea."
    
- "It has drainage channels, but due to rising sea levels, flooding is now a real concern."
    

#### PART 3: Environment & Urban Development

**Q: What are the biggest challenges cities face today?**  
→ “One major issue coastal cities face is climate-related flooding. Many were built near sea level, and older infrastructure like drainage channels are now ineffective.”

**Q: Should countries work together to tackle environmental issues?**  
→ “Absolutely. Cities can’t deal with these problems in isolation — international collaboration is key.”

### IELTS WRITING TASK 2 CONNECTIONS

#### Example Prompt:

**Some people believe that governments should spend money on protecting cities from climate change. Others think they should focus on economic development. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.**

Use points from the transcript:

- Coastal cities suffer from drainage/flooding issues.
    
- Long-term solutions require international cooperation.
    
- Balancing infrastructure upgrades vs. investment in economy

## 🎧 **Effective Listening Practice Process (Full-Skill Integration)**

### ✅ 1. **Take 2 Listening Tests per Week (Full 40 Questions)**

- Simulate real exam conditions (headphones, timing).
    
- Use **Cambridge IELTS books 10–18** for authentic practice.
    
- After finishing, **log your mistakes**, and do a **deep error analysis**.
    

### 📝 2. **Error Log Analysis System**

For every mistake (even close ones), record:

|Type|Question|Wrong Answer|Correct Answer|Why You Missed It|Vocabulary/Structure|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

This helps improve:

- Vocabulary
    
- Grammar
    
- Distractor recognition (very important)
    
- Paraphrasing skills for Reading and Writing

## 🔄 3. **Shadowing & Dictation (Listening → Speaking & Writing)**

Do this with 1 test per week (after checking answers).

### Step-by-step:

1. **Dictation** – write down the full recording transcript for 1 section.
    
2. **Underline synonyms/paraphrased phrases**.
    
3. **Shadow** (repeat aloud with same intonation and rhythm).
    
4. **Summarize the section** in your own words.
    
5. **Record yourself** and evaluate fluency & coherence (like Speaking Part 3).
    

✅ This improves:

- **Listening accuracy**
    
- **Speaking fluency**
    
- **Lexical resource** & complex sentence structure (Writing & Speaking)

## 📚 4. **Create Vocabulary Banks from Listening**

Each test contains **academic + conversational vocabulary**. Create a table:

|Word/Phrase|Meaning|Example from Listening|My Own Sentence|
|---|---|---|---|
|Subsidised|Supported financially|"A heavily subsidised canteen"|My workplace provides subsidised meals.|

✅ Apply these to Writing & Speaking tasks.

---

## 💬 5. **Write & Speak from Listening Topics**

Take themes from Listening (e.g. environment, education, employment):

- **Write** a Task 2 essay on a related question.
    
- **Practice** a Speaking Part 2 & 3 answer on the same topic.
    

This builds content **cohesion between skills**, which is how top scorers learn faster.

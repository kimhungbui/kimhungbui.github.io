__A collocation is a natural combination of words that native speakers commonly used together__

| We Say (Correct)  | ❌ Not Natural     |
| ----------------- | ----------------- |
| fast food         | quick food        |
| a quick glance    | a fast glance     |
| make a mistake    | do a mistake      |
| powerful engine   | strong engine     |
| ancient monuments | antique monuments |
| make an effort    | do an effort      |
Even if the “wrong” version is understandable, it sounds unnatural to native speakers.

## Why Are Collocations Important (Especially for IELTS)?

Learning collocations helps us:

### Speak and write more naturally

- “Smoking is **strictly forbidden**”  
    ❌ Not “strongly forbidden”
    

### Be more expressive and precise

- “It was **bitterly cold** and **pitch dark**”  
    ❌ Not “very cold and very dark”
    

### Improve writing style and variety

-  “Poverty **breeds** crime”  
    ❌ Not “Poverty causes crime”
    
- “A **substantial** meal”  
    ❌ Not “a big meal”
    

## Type of Collocations

|Type|Example|
|---|---|
|Verb + Noun|**make a mistake**, take notes|
|Adjective + Noun|**strong coffee**, heavy traffic|
|Noun + Noun|**a surge of anger**|
|Adverb + Adjective|**deeply disappointed**|
|Verb + Preposition|**depend on**, suffer from|

## Collocations vs Compounds vs Idioms

| Term            | Meaning                                                                                | Example                         |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Collocation** | Natural word combinations                                                              | make an effort, fast food       |
| **Compound**    | Two+ words that form one meaning (can be written as one word, hyphenated, or separate) | car park, teapot, narrow-minded |
| **Idiom**       | A fixed phrase whose meaning is not literal                                            | pass the buck, hit the sack     |

- In **IELTS Writing Task 2**, use **formal collocations** for precision and sophistication:
    
    > _Government policies should **tackle unemployment** and **reduce poverty**_.
    
- In **IELTS Speaking**, natural collocations boost fluency:
    
    > _I always try to **keep in touch** with my old classmates._
    
- Avoid overusing basic combinations like “very + adj” (e.g., _very big_, _very cold_). Use high-level collocations:
    
    > _A **considerable amount** of money_  
    > _A **heated debate** over the topic_

## Underline the collocations in this text

When I left university I __made a decision__ to take up a profession in which I could be creative. I could play the guitar, but I’d never written any songs. Nonetheless, I decided to become a singer-songwriter. I made some recordings but I had a __rather heavy cold__, so they didn’t __sound good__. I made some more, and sent them to a __record company__ and waited
for them to reply.
So, while I was waiting to become famous, I got a job in a __fastfood__ restaurant. That was five years ago. 
I’m still doing the same job.

# Cambridge IELTS 16 - listening test 1
- Total Score: 37/40
- Date: 14/08/2025



# Performance Summary

All my mistakes in that test were related to singular/plural prediction.

# Recording 1

It looks like your mistake in **Q8** (“WEDNESDAY” vs. “WEDNESDAYS”) comes down to a common IELTS listening trap — **plural vs. singular forms**.

  

Here’s why:

1. **Exact wording in the audio**
    
    Sarah says:
    
    > “…so we moved them to **Wednesdays**.”
    
    > She’s talking about the _recurring schedule_, meaning _every Wednesday_, so the plural form is grammatically correct.
    
2. **Why singular “Wednesday” is wrong**
    
    IELTS marking is strict — the answer must match exactly what’s said in the recording (spelling and plurality included).
    
    Even though “Wednesday” might make sense to you as a day, it’s not what the speaker said, so it’s marked wrong.
    
3. **Key listening clue**
    
    When you hear a **day of the week** in plural form, it usually means a repeated weekly event:
    
    - “Classes are on Mondays.” (every Monday)
        
    - “Meetings take place on Fridays.” (every Friday)
        
    
4. **Tip to avoid this mistake**
    
    - When listening, always pay attention to **-s** endings on days, months, and nouns.
        
    - In notes completion tasks, write _exactly_ what you hear, even if you think the singular sounds more natural.

In natural English, that final /s/ is often very soft or blended into the next word, so it’s almost invisible unless you train your ear.

  

Here’s how you can _predict_ plural vs. singular even when you don’t hear the sound clearly:

---

### **Use grammar logic**

  

Look at the sentence structure and the verb form.

- **Plural** → often with plural verbs:
    
    “We moved them to **Wednesdays**.” → _them_ = many classes → must be plural days.
    
- **Singular** → often with “this” or “next”:
    
    “It’s on **Wednesday** next week.” (one time only)
    

---

### **Listen for context**

  

Ask yourself:

- Is this talking about a **regular schedule**? → plural.
    
- Is it a **single event**? → singular.
    

  

In Q8’s case, they were talking about the _regular weekly class_, so “Wednesdays” fits.

---

### **Watch for connecting sounds**

  

Native speakers link words:

- “on Wednesdays at ten” might sound like **“on Wenzdaysat ten”**.
    
- The /s/ merges into the “at” sound, so you don’t hear it as a separate hiss.
    

  

You can train your ear by slowing down recordings (0.75x speed) and replaying just the day-of-week phrases.

---

### **4. Use prediction before the audio**

  

Before listening, scan the notes:

If you see “Held on (8) ______ from 10 am to 11 am” and the topic is weekly workshops → 80% chance it’s plural.

---

## **Step 1 - Know the "plural day" sound patterns**

When native speakers say them quickly:

| **Word**   | **Fast speech sounds like** | **Example sentence**                       |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Mondays    | **Mundez** /ˈmʌn.deɪz/      | “Classes are on **Mundez** at nine.”       |
| Tuesdays   | **Choos-dez** /ˈtʃuːz.deɪz/ | “We meet on **Choos-dez** in the lab.”     |
| Wednesdays | **Wenz-dez** /ˈwenz.deɪz/   | “It’s on **Wenz-dez** mornings.”           |
| Thursdays  | **Thurz-dez** /ˈθɜːrz.deɪz/ | “Workshops are **Thurz-dez** after lunch.” |
| Fridays    | **Fry-dez** /ˈfraɪ.deɪz/    | “We play football on **Fry-dez**.”         |
| Saturdays  | **Sat-uh-dez** /ˈsætə.deɪz/ | “We open on **Sat-uh-dez** only.”          |
| Sundays    | **Sun-dez** /ˈsʌn.deɪz/     | “The market’s on **Sun-dez**.”             |


Notice the final **/z/** sound merges with the next word.

## **Step 2 – Context prediction**

  

Plural → for repeated weekly events:

- “We moved them to **Wednesdays**.”
    
- “It’s always on **Fridays**.”
    

  

Singular → for one-off or fixed date:

- “It’s on **Wednesday** next week.”
    
- “The event is this **Friday**.”
    

---

## **Step 3 – Listening drill**

  

I’ll give you pairs. Your job: decide **SINGULAR** or **PLURAL**.

1. “The meetings are on **Wenz-dez** mornings at ten.”
    
2. “We’ll see you this **Thursday** at the park.”
    
3. “Classes run on **Choos-dez** all month.”
    
4. “The exam is on **Monday** the 14th.”
    
5. “Our practice sessions are always on **Fry-dez**.”

I'm wrong in 39 and 40, both in plural/singular prediction.
## **Q39 – “opportunity” vs “opportunities”**

  

**Transcript:**

  

> Stoics teach turning obstacles into opportunity.

  

- Here the word is **singular** (“opportunity”) because it’s talking about the general idea of **seeing challenges as a single type of positive outcome**, not listing multiple separate chances.
    
- In IELTS listening, when the speaker uses **into opportunity** (no “an” or “the”), it’s usually uncountable or general — same as “into gold” or “into power.”
    
- If it were plural, you’d hear a clearer “opportunities,” with a small /z/ sound at the end.
    

  

**Tip:**

If the word follows **“into”** and is used conceptually, lean towards singular.

---

## **Q40 – “practice” vs “practices”**

  

**Transcript:**

  

> This is not as easy as it sounds and will require considerable practice.

  

- Here it’s **uncountable** — meaning “a lot of doing something to improve a skill,” not “different methods” (which would be “practices”).
    
- In IELTS listening, **considerable** often precedes uncountable nouns like “time,” “effort,” “practice,” “work.”
    
- Plural “practices” would refer to “customs” or “ways of doing things” — different meaning.
    

  

**Tip:**

If preceded by **a lot of**, **considerable**, **much**, **little**, or **some**, the noun is likely uncountable and singular.

## **Quick** **Plural/Singular Prediction** **Signals for IELTS Listening**

|**Signal in Audio**|**Likely Form**|**Example**|
|---|---|---|
|After “a lot of”, “much”, “considerable”|Uncountable (singular)|considerable practice|
|After “many”, “several”, “a number of”|Plural|several opportunities|
|Following “into” in a figurative sense|Singular|turn problems into opportunity|
|Talking about types/kinds|Plural|business practices|
|General concept or quality|Singular|seek happiness, show courage|


**Tip:**

If the word follows **“into”** and is used conceptually, lean towards singular.


If preceded by **a lot of**, **considerable**, **much**, **little**, or **some**, the noun is likely uncountable and singular.

# Cambridge IELTS 16 - listening test 1
- Total Score: 37/40
- Date: 14/08/2025



# Performance Summary

All my mistakes in that test were related to singular/plural prediction.

Today i get 37/40 ielts, all wrong in plural/singular, I can learn the acceptance/decline type question in task 3 of the previous test, and do the test correctly

I think maps in listening is my advantage, i can look at the map and easier to think and hear.

# Recording 1

It looks like your mistake in **Q8** (“WEDNESDAY” vs. “WEDNESDAYS”) comes down to a common IELTS listening trap — **plural vs. singular forms**.

  

Here’s why:

1. **Exact wording in the audio**
    
    Sarah says:
    
    > “…so we moved them to **Wednesdays**.”
    
    > She’s talking about the _recurring schedule_, meaning _every Wednesday_, so the plural form is grammatically correct.
    
2. **Why singular “Wednesday” is wrong**
    
    IELTS marking is strict — the answer must match exactly what’s said in the recording (spelling and plurality included).
    
    Even though “Wednesday” might make sense to you as a day, it’s not what the speaker said, so it’s marked wrong.
    
3. **Key listening clue**
    
    When you hear a **day of the week** in plural form, it usually means a repeated weekly event:
    
    - “Classes are on Mondays.” (every Monday)
        
    - “Meetings take place on Fridays.” (every Friday)
        
    
4. **Tip to avoid this mistake**
    
    - When listening, always pay attention to **-s** endings on days, months, and nouns.
        
    - In notes completion tasks, write _exactly_ what you hear, even if you think the singular sounds more natural.

In natural English, that final /s/ is often very soft or blended into the next word, so it’s almost invisible unless you train your ear.

  

Here’s how you can _predict_ plural vs. singular even when you don’t hear the sound clearly:

---

### **Use grammar logic**

  

Look at the sentence structure and the verb form.

- **Plural** → often with plural verbs:
    
    “We moved them to **Wednesdays**.” → _them_ = many classes → must be plural days.
    
- **Singular** → often with “this” or “next”:
    
    “It’s on **Wednesday** next week.” (one time only)
    

---

### **Listen for context**

  

Ask yourself:

- Is this talking about a **regular schedule**? → plural.
    
- Is it a **single event**? → singular.
    

  

In Q8’s case, they were talking about the _regular weekly class_, so “Wednesdays” fits.

---

### **Watch for connecting sounds**

  

Native speakers link words:

- “on Wednesdays at ten” might sound like **“on Wenzdaysat ten”**.
    
- The /s/ merges into the “at” sound, so you don’t hear it as a separate hiss.
    

  

You can train your ear by slowing down recordings (0.75x speed) and replaying just the day-of-week phrases.

---

### **4. Use prediction before the audio**

  

Before listening, scan the notes:

If you see “Held on (8) ______ from 10 am to 11 am” and the topic is weekly workshops → 80% chance it’s plural.

---

## **Step 1 - Know the "plural day" sound patterns**

When native speakers say them quickly:

| **Word**   | **Fast speech sounds like** | **Example sentence**                       |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Mondays    | **Mundez** /ˈmʌn.deɪz/      | “Classes are on **Mundez** at nine.”       |
| Tuesdays   | **Choos-dez** /ˈtʃuːz.deɪz/ | “We meet on **Choos-dez** in the lab.”     |
| Wednesdays | **Wenz-dez** /ˈwenz.deɪz/   | “It’s on **Wenz-dez** mornings.”           |
| Thursdays  | **Thurz-dez** /ˈθɜːrz.deɪz/ | “Workshops are **Thurz-dez** after lunch.” |
| Fridays    | **Fry-dez** /ˈfraɪ.deɪz/    | “We play football on **Fry-dez**.”         |
| Saturdays  | **Sat-uh-dez** /ˈsætə.deɪz/ | “We open on **Sat-uh-dez** only.”          |
| Sundays    | **Sun-dez** /ˈsʌn.deɪz/     | “The market’s on **Sun-dez**.”             |


Notice the final **/z/** sound merges with the next word.

---



## **Step 2 – Context prediction**

  

Plural → for repeated weekly events:

- “We moved them to **Wednesdays**.”
    
- “It’s always on **Fridays**.”
    

  

Singular → for one-off or fixed date:

- “It’s on **Wednesday** next week.”
    
- “The event is this **Friday**.”
    

---

## **Step 3 – Listening drill**

  

I’ll give you pairs. Your job: decide **SINGULAR** or **PLURAL**.

1. “The meetings are on **Wenz-dez** mornings at ten.”
    
2. “We’ll see you this **Thursday** at the park.”
    
3. “Classes run on **Choos-dez** all month.”
    
4. “The exam is on **Monday** the 14th.”
    
5. “Our practice sessions are always on **Fry-dez**.”

## **Multiple‑choice traps (Q11–Q14)**

- **Q11 – Founded year**
    
    - Dates flying around: **1923** (entered steel industry), **1924** (started planning), **1926** (**founded**).
        
    - **Trap:** picking the _earlier_ dates that sound important.
        
    - **Answer logic:** “He **set up this company** … **in 1926**.”
        
    
- **Q12 – Original products**
    
    - Long‑term plan: machine tools + automotive.
        
    - **But** a 5‑year **delay** to make goods for **hospitals/healthcare**.
        
    - **Trap:** choosing what was _planned_ instead of what actually **happened first**.
        
    - **Answer logic:** Healthcare.
        
    
- **Q13 – Premises (move vs refurbish)**
    
    - “Site is big enough, so **moving … has never been necessary**,” and they **intend to refurbish**.
        
    - **Trap:** hearing “major refurbishment” and assuming **moving**.
        
    - **Answer logic:** **No plans to move** (refurbish current site).
        
    
- **Q14 – Programme content**
    
    - “Most mornings you’ll have a **presentation** from a **manager**.”
        
    - Teacher visit **not** this year; no time allocated for independent research.
        
    - **Trap:** picking “meetings with a teacher” or “time to do research.”
        
    - **Answer logic:** **Talks by staff**.
        
    

  

## **Map‑label traps (Q15–Q20)**

  

General map strategy:

- **Fix your orientation**: Reception as starting point; note **left/right**, **facing you**, **far side**, **past**, **at the end**.
    
- **Windows/views help**: “looks out onto the **main road** / **trees** / **courtyard**” = placement clues.
    
- **Road access**: Lorries, turning area → **warehouse** side.
    

  

Item‑by‑item cues:

- **Q15 – Coffee room**
    
    - “Corridor **left** from reception → door **facing you** at the **end**.”
        
    - “Looks out onto **main road** (one side) and **trees** (other).”
        
    - **Traps:** confusing “facing you” with left/right doors; ignoring view clues.
        
    
- **Q16 – Warehouse**
    
    - “Next to factory.”
        
    - “Accessed by lorries … **turning area** at the end.”
        
    - “Cross to **far side** of courtyard → **door on your right**.”
        
    - **Traps:** picking the factory instead; mixing up near‑side vs far‑side.
        
    
- **Q17 – Staff canteen**
    
    - “**Right next to reception**.”
        
    - Views are **poor** (corridor/courtyard or access road).
        
    - **Trap:** choosing a room with nice view; forgetting the “next to reception” anchor.
        
    
- **Q18 – Meeting room**
    
    - “Walk along corridor **to the left of the courtyard** → **to the end** → **last on the right**.”
        
    - “**No natural daylight**.”
        
    - **Trap:** selecting any right‑hand room; missing “**last** on the right.”
        
    
- **Q19 – Human Resources**
    
    - “At the **front** of this building.”
        
    - “From reception, go **left**; it’s the **second room** you come to.”
        
    - “Looks out onto the **main road**.”
        
    - **Trap:** picking the first room; ignoring the “front/main road” view.
        
    
- **Q20 – Boardroom**
    
    - “Go along the corridor **past the courtyard**, **right to the end**.”
        
    - “On the **left**, **next to the factory**; view of the **trees**.”
        
    - **Traps:** choosing a right‑hand room at the end; ignoring adjacency to the factory.
        
    

  

# **Paraphrases & signal words that hide answers**

- **Founded/set up** = established.
    
- **Went into production** ≠ founded.
    
- **Premises** = buildings/site; **layout far from ideal** → refurbishment, not relocation.
    
- **Carry out major refurbishment** = upgrade the same site.
    
- **Accessed by lorries / turning area** = warehouse zone.
    
- **Facing you / at the end / far side** = orientation markers.
    
- **Looks out onto** (main road/trees/courtyard) = view anchor.
    

  

# **Micro‑listening tips for maps**

- **Underline directionals** while reading: left / right / at the end / past / next to / on your right.
    
- **Circle view nouns**: main road / trees / courtyard / access road.
    
- **Sketch quick arrows** from reception to each target as they speak.
    
- **Pause prediction**: before the location noun, predict likely zone (e.g., warehouse near lorry access).
    

  

# **Quick practice prompts (self‑check)**

- “Door **facing you** at the **end**” → Which letter is directly ahead, not left/right?
    
- “**Second room** on the left from reception; **front** of building; **main road** view” → Which letter matches all three?
    
- “**Next to** factory; view of **trees**” → Boardroom, not warehouse.

## **Q21–Q22: Introductory stage – useful parts**

  

**Theme:** _Introductory stage activities_

  

**Key details:**

- **Handouts with research sources**: Jess says _“I was put off, but the more I read, the more interested I got”_ → useful.
    
- **Natural History Museum**: Both agree _“much more use than Bird Park”_ → useful.
    
- **Bird Park visit**: Disappointment, so **not** chosen.
    
- **Workshop sessions**: Only Tom attended; Jess missed them → not both.
    
- **Projects from previous years**: They _wish_ they had them, but didn’t → not useful.
    

  

**Traps:**

- Mention of **Bird Park** first might make you tick it; but their reaction is negative.
    
- Workshop sessions are praised, but only one attended → wrong for “both agree.”
    

  

**Answers:** **E** (handouts) + **C** (Natural History Museum).

---

## **Q23–Q24: Proposal changes**

  

**Theme:** _Adjustments to proposals_

  

**Key details:**

- Tom: notes are only descriptions, needs to **evaluate** → Jess: _“I’ll have to look at that too”_ → **E** (more evaluative notes).
    
- Jess: _“Best not to be too precise about actual outcome”_ → Tom: _“OK, I’ll change that too”_ → **B** (less specific about outcome).
    
- **Rationale for action plans**: Only Jess did it, Tom will add → **not** both.
    
- **Video diary presentation**: Tom already did, Jess didn’t say she will → **not** both.
    
- **Timeline/mind map**: Both already did → not a **change**.
    

  

**Traps:**

- They talk about several tasks in one go; but question is only about **changes** they’ll make now.
    
- Some items are **already done**, so irrelevant.
    

  

**Answers:** **E** + **B**.

## **Q25–Q30: Personal meanings**

  

**Theme:** _Interpreting art pieces personally_

  

**Key mapping:**

| **Q#** | **Artwork**                    | **Key words in dialogue**                                 | **Answer** |
| ------ | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| 25     | Falcon (Landseer)              | _“staring straight at you” → “possible danger suggested”_ | **D**      |
| 26     | Fish hawk (Audubon)            | _“swooping” → “rapid motion”_                             | **C**      |
| 27     | Kingfisher (Van Gogh)          | _“saw a real one as a child with my grandfather”_         | **A**      |
| 28     | Portrait of William Wells      | _“ambiguous about exploiting nature”_                     | **H**      |
| 29     | Vairumati (Gauguin)            | _“reference to never-ending cycle of existence”_          | **F**      |
| 30     | Portrait of Giovanni de Medici | _“holding it carefully so he doesn’t hurt it”_            | **G**      |

**Traps:**

- Some answers are implied by **paraphrase**, not exact word:
    
    - “Possible danger” → **potential threat**.
        
    - “Never-ending cycle” → **continuity of life**.
        
    - “Holding carefully” → **protection of nature**.
        
    
- The box has distractors (**B**, **E**) that are never mentioned.
    

---

## **General listening traps for Part 3**

1. **Mutual agreement filter** – If question says “both agree,” check that both speakers confirm it (even briefly).
    
2. **Change vs already done** – For proposal questions, “change” means new modification, not something they completed earlier.
    
3. **Personal meaning** – Often requires **inference** from description rather than direct label in audio.
    
4. **Negative vs positive opinion** – Don’t tick something just because it’s discussed early; listen for positive or negative reaction.
    
5. **Paraphrasing** – IELTS will rephrase the answer, so match meaning, not exact words.
# Recording 4

I'm wrong in 39 and 40, both in plural/singular prediction.


☑️ In business, people benefit from Stoicism by identifying obstacles as **(39)** ……………………….. .  
  
**Relevance of Stoicism**  
☑️ It requires a lot of **(40)** ……………………….. but Stoicism can help people to lead a good life.


Let’s break down why **Q39** and **Q40** were _singular_ despite your prediction:

---

### **Q39: Obstacles → opportunity**

  

> “…Stoics teach **turning obstacles into opportunity**.”

  

- **Why singular?**
    
    “Opportunity” here is an _uncountable concept_ — like “freedom” or “happiness.”
    
    The idea is that _all obstacles together_ can be transformed into _the general idea of opportunity_, not multiple individual opportunities.
    
- **Plural trap:**
    
    The plural “obstacles” nearby makes our brain want symmetry (“opportunities”), but grammar meaning overrules symmetry here.
    

---

### **Q40: A lot of → practice**

  

> “It requires a lot of practice, but Stoicism can help people…”

  

- **Why singular?**
    
    “Practice” here is uncountable (meaning _the act of practising_).
    
    Uncountable nouns don’t take plural even after “a lot of.”
    
    Compare:
    
    - “a lot of work” ✅ (uncountable)
        
    - “a lot of books” ✅ (countable plural)
        
    
- **Plural trap:**
    
    We’re trained to think “a lot of” = plural, but it only does that with countable nouns.
### **The takeaway skill**

  

When predicting plural/singular in listening:

1. **Check the noun type** in your head:
    
    - **Countable →** can be plural (“opportunities”) or singular (“opportunity”).
        
    - **Uncountable →** always singular form (“practice”).
        
    
2. **Don’t be misled by nearby plurals** — they don’t force the answer to match.
    
3. **Listen for context meaning**: Are they talking about _a general idea_ or _individual items_?

## **Q39 – “opportunity” vs “opportunities”**

  

**Transcript:**

  

> Stoics teach turning obstacles into opportunity.

  

- Here the word is **singular** (“opportunity”) because it’s talking about the general idea of **seeing challenges as a single type of positive outcome**, not listing multiple separate chances.
    
- In IELTS listening, when the speaker uses **into opportunity** (no “an” or “the”), it’s usually uncountable or general — same as “into gold” or “into power.”
    
- If it were plural, you’d hear a clearer “opportunities,” with a small /z/ sound at the end.
    

  

**Tip:**

If the word follows **“into”** and is used conceptually, lean towards singular.

---

## **Q40 – “practice” vs “practices”**

  

**Transcript:**

  

> This is not as easy as it sounds and will require considerable practice.

  

- Here it’s **uncountable** — meaning “a lot of doing something to improve a skill,” not “different methods” (which would be “practices”).
    
- In IELTS listening, **considerable** often precedes uncountable nouns like “time,” “effort,” “practice,” “work.”
    
- Plural “practices” would refer to “customs” or “ways of doing things” — different meaning.
    

  

**Tip:**

If preceded by **a lot of**, **considerable**, **much**, **little**, or **some**, the noun is likely uncountable and singular.

---

## **Quick** **Plural/Singular Prediction** **Signals for IELTS Listening**

|**Signal in Audio**|**Likely Form**|**Example**|
|---|---|---|
|After “a lot of”, “much”, “considerable”|Uncountable (singular)|considerable practice|
|After “many”, “several”, “a number of”|Plural|several opportunities|
|Following “into” in a figurative sense|Singular|turn problems into opportunity|
|Talking about types/kinds|Plural|business practices|
|General concept or quality|Singular|seek happiness, show courage|


**Tip:**

If the word follows **“into”** and is used conceptually, lean towards singular.


If preceded by **a lot of**, **considerable**, **much**, **little**, or **some**, the noun is likely uncountable and singular.

1. - Is it a _general concept_? → singular.
        
    - Is it _individual items_? → plural.

| **Q2**  | **sound**     | **microphone**   | You understood the general **idea** (something related to sound), but not the **specific item** they said. The man asked specifically: “How about a microphone?” — this was answered directly. | 🔄 **Strategy**: If you hear a general topic (e.g. sound), listen for a specific **equipment name** that follows. Repeat Qs in your head: “Do they have a ___?” |
| **Q10** | **club**      | **clubs**        | This was a **plural mistake**. The speaker said: “... one of the **clubs** in the area — there are a great many to choose from.” The word “many” confirms it's plural.                         | 🔄 **Strategy**: Always check if they mention **numbers** or words like _“many,” “a few,” “several”_, which mean the answer should be **plural**.               |

| Your answers                    | ✅ Correct answers                     | Notes |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----- |
| **D** Shopping **A** Decorating | ✅ **A. Decorating**✅ **E. Childcare** |       |
You got A (decorating) correct – mentioned as: “do some painting or wallpapering.”

You chose D (shopping) — not quite correct. Shopping is suggested in the line:

“...recommend how to plan their budget or how to shop sensibly…”

But that's only giving advice, not actually shopping.

You missed E (childcare) — mentioned as:

“...do some babysitting so that parents can go out...”

This is direct childcare.

🟨 Common trap: Hearing a keyword (like “shop”) without checking if it's the actual activity done by the volunteer.

|Q|Volunteer|Your Answer|✅ Correct|Why|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**15**|Habib|**A**|✅ **F** (Remember past times)|He takes elderly people to sing-alongs that _“take the listeners back to their youth.”_|
|**16**|Consuela|**B**|✅ **A** (Overcome physical difficulties)|_“She has difficulty walking herself”_ and helps others with walking.|
|**17**|Minh|✅ **E**|✅|Helps isolated man go out again — clearly about _escaping isolation_.|
|**18**|Tanya|✅ **G**|✅|Elderly woman picks up **toy-making** as a _new hobby_.|
|**19**|Alexei|✅ **D**|✅|Helps family _solve problems themselves_ = independence.|
|**20**|Juba|✅ **C**|✅|Teen girl now _“far better at expressing herself”_ — communication.|

🔹 Q15: Habib → F (Remember past times)

You chose A: Overcome physical difficulties — which is not the case. It was about music triggering memories, not about any physical help.

✅ What to listen for:

"Songs take them back to their youth" → keyword: “remember”, not “recover physically”

🔹 Q16: Consuela → A (Overcome physical difficulties)

You chose B: Rediscover skills not used — but she wasn't helping them recover a skill like cooking or crafting.

Instead, it was walking — she inspires mobility by example.

✅ Tip: Listen for physical movement = “overcome physical difficulties”

# Recording 3

|Q|❌ Your Answer|✅ Correct Answer|Explanation|
|---|---|---|---|
|**21**|**15**|✅ **50** (or **fifty**)|Joe says: *“there are about *_50 of them altogether.”_ You may have misheard or confused with "under 20" (his previous experience). Always focus on **what is said now**, not past comparison.|
|**22**|**NATIONAL**|✅ **REGIONAL**|Joe says: _“They aren't really good enough to enter **national** band competitions, but they're in a **regional** one later in the term.”_ “Regional” is correct; “national” is a **trap word**.|
|**23**|✅ **CARNIVAL**|✅ **CARNIVAL**|Correct. He clearly says: _“the town council’s organising a **carnival** in the summer.”_|
|**24**|**DRAMA**|✅ **DRUMMER**|Joe says: _“I played a recording… of a **drummer** talking about how playing in a band had changed his life.”_ You misheard **“drummer”** as **“drama”** — a common pronunciation trap.|

|Question|Your Answer|Correct?|Mistake Type|
|---|---|---|---|
|Q21|15|❌|Misheard number (possibly confused with earlier info)|
|Q22|NATIONAL|❌|Chose a **trap word** (national ≠ regional)|
|Q23|CARNIVAL|✅|–|
|Q24|DRAMA|❌|Misheard word (drummer)|

Tips to Fix These Mistakes

🔹 Q21 – Mishearing Numbers

Practice listening to quantities with context, especially when they contrast past and present:

“I used to teach bands of 20, this one has about 50.”

✅ Fix: Pause & mentally label the number with "current size".

🔹 Q22 – Trap Words

This is a classic IELTS trick: mention a wrong option first (national), then correct it (regional).

“Not national… but regional.”

✅ Fix: Focus on what they finally decide, not the first idea.

🔹 Q24 – Drummer vs Drama

"Drummer" and "Drama" are close in sound, but context helps:

"...playing in a band changed his life" → clearly a musician, not an actor.

✅ Fix: Listen for context clues. Ask: who is talking, what’s the story about?

| -------- | ----------- | -------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 32       | vibrant     | energy         | Word type/grammar error        | Used adjective instead of correct noun that fits “a great deal of”       |
| 40       | Olympic     | Olympics       | Word form (noun vs. adjective) | Used adjective instead of correct noun; didn’t match grammar of sentence |

Question 32

You wrote: VIBRANT

Correct answer: ENERGY

Transcript:

“Liza Lim's compositions are vibrant and full of energy...”

Why this is wrong:

The question says:

“compositions show a great deal of _____”

→ So you need a noun that matches "a great deal of".

"A great deal of" cannot be followed by adjectives like "vibrant".

"Vibrant" describes the style, but the answer must be a specific noun, and that noun is "energy".

:::{.callout-tip}
- Pay close attention to grammatical structures in the question.

- Look for exact matches between the question's collocations (like "a great deal of") and the noun in the audio.

- Words near the answer (like "vibrant") can mislead you — IELTS often puts distractors nearby to test your focus on function, not just vocabulary.

Question 40

You wrote: OLYMPIC

Correct answer: OLYMPICS

Transcript:

“...his music for the flag hand-over ceremony of the Olympics held in 1996.”

Why this is wrong:

The word "Olympic" is an adjective (e.g. Olympic Games, Olympic athlete).

The blank in the sentence requires a noun to complete the phrase:

“festival will include his music for the 1996 ________”

So the correct noun is Olympics, referring to the global sports event.

Tip:

Always match the word form (noun/verb/adjective) to the grammar of the sentence.

Listen for plural endings — “Olympics” is clearly plural in pronunciation.

Review common proper nouns and event names like "the Olympics", "the World Cup", etc.

:::{.callout.note}
## How to improve
1. Check the grammar of the sentence before choosing your answer — think: Does this need a noun? An adjective? A plural?

2. Underline key phrases in the question, such as “a great deal of,” “consists of,” “includes,” etc.

3. Practice identifying distractors — words that appear in the audio but are not correct answers.

4. Improve your listening for plurals and noun forms, especially for names of events or measurements.

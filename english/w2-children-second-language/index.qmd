Some people think that children should learn a second language at primary school. Others believe it is better to wait until secondary school. Discuss both views and give your opinion.

introduction

In many parts of the world, when children begin to learn a second language has become a topic of debate. This essay will discuss both sides of the argument and explain why I completely agree that starting at primary school is more beneficial.

It is true that ~~children who are learning language earlier~~ children who start learning a second language early are more receptive to new sounds and structures than those who start later. First and foremost, at primary school age, children's brains are more flexible, allowing them to ~~pick up pronunciation and grammar more naturally~~ acquire correct pronunciation and grammatical structures with greater ease. As a result, they often develop a stronger accent and better overall fluency than those who start later. Furthermore, learning a language does not need a highly abstract ~~thinking~~ cognitive ~~skill like math, physics, ...~~ subjects like mathematics and physics, which are normally developed in more mature students. ~~So, letting them invest in a second language when in primary school is a better investment than other fields.~~ -> Therefore/ Hence, it is more effective to focus on second language acquisition at primary school than on other fields.

Nevertheless, some argue that children should begin learning a second language at secondary school or later, rather than at primary school. They suggest that older students have more developed cognitive abilities, allowing them to grasp complex grammar rules and language structures more quickly than younger learners. As a result, ~~they can learn language more effectively in a shorter time than younger age~~ they may achieve noticeable progress in a shorter period. In addition, adolescents may be more motivated because they can appreciate its relevance to future education and career opportunities / they can understand the relevance of language learning for their future education and career prospects. ~~Because of that, they can have a choice of themself about which language they should learn and be more independent in the road of learning.~~ They also have more autonomy in choosing which language to study and can take greater responsibility for their learning. While these points have some merit, I believe the advantages of starting early outweigh the benefits of a later start.

In conclusion, while some argue that older children may learn a second language more quickly due to their cognitive maturity and motivation, I firmly believe that starting at primary school is more beneficial. Early exposure provides a longer period for practice, enhances pronunciation and grammar acquisition, and supports overall cognitive development. Consequently, beginning language learning at a young age offers advantages that outweigh those of a later start.

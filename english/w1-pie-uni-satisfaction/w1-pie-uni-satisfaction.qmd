---

### **Step 1: Overview**

- Identify _what the charts show_: students’ satisfaction (undergraduate and postgraduate) in 2007.
    
- Identify _main features_:
    
    - Postgraduates were generally more satisfied than undergraduates.
        
    - The highest satisfaction was with school facilities (85%), and the lowest with cafeterias among undergraduates (52%).
        
    

---

### **Step 2: Key Trends (Group the data logically)**

1. **School Rooms**
    
    - Both groups mostly “very satisfied” (62–63%), very similar results.
        
    - Fewest students were “quite satisfied” (13–14%).
        
    
2. **University Cafeteria**
    
    - Postgraduates much happier (73%) than undergraduates (52%).
        
    - Undergraduates had higher “not satisfied” (26%).
        
    
3. **School Facilities**
    
    - Undergraduates extremely satisfied (85%) — highest across all charts.
        
    - Postgraduates more mixed (43% very satisfied, 32% quite satisfied).

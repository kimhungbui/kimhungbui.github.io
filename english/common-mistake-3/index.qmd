If we use a plural noun, we must use a plural verb. The verb must 'agree' with the noun:

_In my country, __there are__ very few __cars__ that use leaded petrol._ (plural verb + plural noun)

_I like studying during the day but __my friend prefers__ studying at night._ (singular noun + singular verb)

We use a plural noun with:
- plural verbs: _are, were, have, do, play, etc._: There are a lot of books on the table.
- numbers greater than one: 30 cars, 100 students
- _many_: It is annoying that so __many buses drive__ fast because they __are__ full.
- _the number of_: __The number of buses__ on our roads __has__ increased each year.

Note that we use a plural noun but a singular verb after _the number of_

We use a singular noun with:
- singular verbs: _is, was, has, does, plays, etc._: There is only one bedroom in the flat.
- _a/an_ or _one_: a car, one student

Note that some nouns can look plural but are singular (_news, mathematics_) and some nouns have a different form in the plural (_children, men, women, people_)

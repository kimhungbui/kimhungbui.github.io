# Independent Clause & Subordinate Clause

A __clause__ í a word group that contains a subject and a verb. If that clause can stand alone-in other words, if that clause is the same as a sentence-we call it an ___independent clause___.

__independent clause__: She __held__ the scale

__subordinate clause__: as she __held__ the scale

::: {.callout-note}
When we say that a clause is _subordinate_, we are not referring to its importance, but simply to its grammatical dependence on the independent clause.
:::

A complex sentence is a _sentence that contains at least one subordinate clause_.

Subordinate clauses can be divided into three categories based on their function:
- adjective clauses
- adverb clauses
- noun clauses

Example:
- Independent clause/sentence: _They_ __got__ into a station wagon. (has a subject and verb and can stand alone).
- Subordinate clause/adverb: As _they_ __got__ into a station wagon. (has a subject and verb but cannot stand alone).
- subordinate clause/adjective: _Which_ __was__ a station wagon. (has a subject and verb but cannot stand alone)
- subordinate clause/noun: That _they_ __got__ into a station wagon.

Example:
1. A single sword is held aloft. (independent)
2. After you left me. (subordinate)
3. Because my uncle sat at the stone table. (subordinate)
4. That a serpentine hair bangs over one ear. (subordinate)
5. Which is a hidden pleasure. (subordinate)
6. Who knew the rules and punishments. (subordinate)
7. Why she chose to wear the hex on her forehead. (subordinate)
8. You lose yourself in the cave of endless breath. (independent)

# Subordinating Conjunctions

An __adverbial subordinate clause__ begins with a __subordinating conjunction__.
That list:
- after, as if, as long as, as soon as, although, as, as if, because, before, even if, if, since, so that, though, till, unless, when, whenever, wherever, while.

Let's take a complete sentence, add a word to that complete sentence, and get less than a complete sentence.

- start with a complete sentence: _the sunset behind Lake Tahoe is spectacular_
- add a word: _although_
- get less than a complete sentence: _although the sunset behind lake Tahoe is spectacular_

This is how adverb clauses are created.

- a subordinating conjunction + a sentence = an adverb clause
- _although_ + _the sunset behind Lake Tahoe is spectacular_ = an adverb clause

# Adverb Clauses: Two Patterns

We must understand that the three-part formula and the two-part formula below are _two ways_ of saying the same thing.
- 3-part formula: independent clause + subordinating conjunction + independent clause
- 2-part formula: independent clause + subordinating clause

A subordinate clause consists of a subordinating conjunction + an independent clause. From the previous lesson, we used this process to create a subordinate clause. Therefore, it helps to insert brackets into our 3-part formula so that we can see more clearly how the two formulas are really the same:
- 3-part formula: independent clause + [subordinating conjunction + independent clause] = complex sentence
- 2-part formula: independent clause + [subordinate clause] = complex sentence

Example:
- 3-part formula: you can try climbing on my back + [if + there is no ladder] = complex sentence
- 2-part formula: you can try climbing on my back + [if there is no ladder] = complex sentence

With complex sentences, the conjunctions can easily get hidden: they can disappear within the term _subordinate clause_. 
We can solve that problem by keeping in mind that our conjunctions are inside our subordinate clauses—and in most cases, they serve as the first word of those clauses.

## Pattern 1 and Pattern 2

The two most common places where adverbial subordinate clauses can be placed are after an independent clause and before an independent clause - on the right side or on the left side.

- (the left side) __independent clause__ (the right side)
- (an adverbial subordinate clause can be placed here) independent clause
(an adverbial subordinate clause can be placed here).

Here are the two basic patterns:
- __pattern 1__: independent clause + adverbial subordinate clause
- __pattern 2__: adverbial subordinate clause + (,) + independent clause

A __pattern 1__ sentence - with the adverbial subordinate clause to the right - looks like this:
- He called me to the tannery [because it was Sunday]. (no comma)

A __pattern 2__ sentence- with the adverbial subordinate clause to the left - looks like this:
- [Because it was Sunday], he called me to the tannery. (note the comma).

## Exercises
Each of the following sentences follows pattern 1, as described above. You
will be asked to identify independent clauses and adverbial subordinate
clauses (adverb clauses for short). The independent clauses will be to the left.
Remember that adverb clauses begin with subordinating conjunctions. In all
of the examples below, the independent clause stops just before the
subordinating conjunction; the adverb clause begins with the subordinating
conjunction.
Here are the subordinating conjunctions:
after, as if, as long as, as soon as, although, as, as if, because, before,
even if, if, since, so that, though, till, unless, until, when, whenever,
wherever, while

# Adverb Clauses: Pattern 2

## Exercises
The following sentences are all pattern 2 sentences. You will be asked to
identify independent clauses and subordinate clauses. This time the
subordinate clauses will be to the left. Use the commas to guide you.
Remember that adverbial subordinate clauses begin with subordinating
conjunctions, listed here:
after, as if, as long as, as soon as, although, as, as if, because, before,
even if, if, since, so that, though, till, unless, until, when, whenever,
wherever, while

-> When loneliness comes stalking.

# Subjects and Verbs in Sentences with Adverbial Subordinate Clauses

I sojourn here [THOUGH the sedge has withered from the lake].
Independent clause: I sojourn here
Subordinate clause: THOUGH the sedge has withered from the lake

The sentence above presents us with two sets of subjects and verbs: __I sojourn__ and __sedge has withered__. Because one subject-verb combination appears in the independent clause and the other in the subordinate clause, we can think of the two subject-verb combinations as primary and secondary.
- primary: I sojourn
- secondary: sedge has withered

The primary subject-verb combination serves as the subject-verb of the complex sentences. When asked for _the subject_ and verb of a complex sentence, we respond with the primary subject-verb-- in this case, _I sojourn_. However, if we asked for a subject-verb in the sentence above, we can then point to either of the two subject-verb combinations.

## What makes adverbial subordinate clauses adverbial?

Within each adverbial subordinate clause lies a subject and a verb. The adverbial work done by an adverb clause is done upon the verb in the _independent clause_.

- I __sojourn__ here through the sedge has withered from the lake.

Here, the adverbial subordinate clause _through the sedge has withered from the lake_ describes the surprising nature of the verb _sojourn_. Normally, we assume that when the sedge starts withering, people quit their sojourning and get on with their lives. 

As noted earlier, in complex sentences we find a hierarchy of subjects and verbs- a _primary_ subject-verb and a _secondary_ subject-verb.

I sojourn here [THOUGH the sedge has withered from the lake].
In this example, the primary subject-verb combination (I sojourn) is found in
the left-hand, independent clause; the secondary subject-verb (sedge has
withered) is found in the right-hand, subordinate clause.
- primary base sentence: I sojourn
- secondary base sentence: sedge has withered

## Exercises

Your task in this Your Turn is to identify the base sentences in each of the
two clauses: one subject-verb combination in the independent clause and one
in the subordinate clause.
In the following eight sentences, all subordinate clauses begin with one of the
following subordinating conjunctions:
after, although, because, before, so that, when.
PATTERN 1
1. You begin when you are ready. [What is the primary base sentence? The
secondary?]
-primary base sentence: you begin
-secondary base sentence: you are 
2. The weathermen clomped four miles on snowshoes to get to their seats
after they had thumped the vending machines empty. [What is the primary
base sentence? The secondary?]
-primary base sentence: the weathermen clomped
-secondary base sentence: they had thumped
3. The heart of youth is so light because on its hot brow the wind of promise
blows. [What is the primary base sentence? The secondary?]
-primary base sentence: heart is
-secondary base sentence: wind blows
4. The war was solved by isolating the two sections of the enemy’s navy so
that the mainland could protect the smaller ships. [What is the primary
base sentence? The secondary?]
-primary base sentence: war was solved
-secondary base sentence: mainland could protect
PATTERN 2
5. When you are ready, you begin. [What is the primary base sentence? The
secondary?]
-primary base sentence: you begin
-secondary base sentence: you are 
6. After they had thumped the vending machines empty, the weathermen
clomped four miles on snowshoes to get to their seats. [What is the
primary base sentence? The secondary?]
-primary base sentence: heart is
-secondary base sentence: wind blows
7. Although the same words have been uttered, these questions have a
different form. [What is the primary base sentence? The secondary?]
-primary base sentence: these question have
-secondary base sentence: the same words have been uttered
8. Before we leave from this good high place, we must catch a view of the
city. [What is the primary base sentence? The secondary?]
-primary base sentence: we must catch
-secondary base sentence: we leave

# Adverb Clauses - Mixed Patterns

We’ve been studying two sentence patterns:

- **Pattern 1:** Independent clause + subordinate clause
    
- **Pattern 2:** Subordinate clause + comma + independent clause
    

In the last two lessons, we looked at these patterns separately. This time, they will be mixed together in the exercises.

As we practice, we’ll focus on using the rules correctly. However, there’s one exception. Sometimes, you can use a **comma in pattern 1**, especially when the subordinate clause starts with words like **although, as (meaning because), since (meaning because), though**, or **while (meaning whereas).**

So, the exception looks like this:  
**Independent clause + comma + subordinate clause**

Example:
- He decided to take a break, although he still had work to do.
- The roads were busy, as it was a holiday.
- She enjoys outdoor sports, while her sister prefers reading.
- I like the new plan, though it might be risky.

## Exercises

For each of the twelve sentences below, identify the two clauses.
Which is the independent clause?
Which is the adverbial subordinate clause?
To do this, you will need to know whether the subordinate clause is on the
left or the right. The presence or absence of a comma will give you the
information you need. Is there a comma?
yes—the subordinate clause is to the left
no—the subordinate clause is to the right
And here, once again, are the subordinating conjunctions:
after, although, as, because, before, even if, if, since, so that, though, till,
unless, until, when, whenever, wherever, while
1. He gunned the engine till he had hauled it out. [Which is the independent
clause? Which is the adverbial subordinate clause?]
-independent clause: he gunned the engine
-adverbial subordinate clause: till he had hauled it out.
2. I had decided to maintain seven personalities because seven is a mystical number.
-independent clause: I had decided to maintain seven personalities
-adverbial subordinate clause: because seven is a mystical number
number.
3. Though his family was already on their way, he knelt and raked his bare
hands through that mound of dirt.
-independent clause: he knelt and raked ...
-adverbial subordinate clause: though his family was already on their way.
4. If I had wings, I would have opened them.
   -independent clause:I would have opened them
-adverbial subordinate clause: If i had wings.
5. After I’d betrayed myself, I wish I had answered differently.
   -independent clause: I wish I had answered differently.
-adverbial subordinate clause: after I'd betrayed myself.
6. Let me hoist you back up onto this Ship of Fools so that we might
continue our search for the Fountain of Youth.
-independent clause: let me hoist you back up onto this ship ...
-adverbial subordinate clause: so that we might continue our search for the Fountain ....
7. One must learn to be content with staying home since all places one
cannot go are fabulous.
-independent clause: One must learn to be content with staying home
-adverbial subordinate clause: since all places one cannot go are fabulous.
8. The registrar delivered her narrative while the voices crashed.
   -independent clause: the registrar delivered her narrative
-adverbial subordinate clause: while the voices crashed.
9. Before she can remove her hand from the knob, the whole building will
collapse.
-independent clause: the whole building will collapse
-adverbial subordinate clause: before she can remove her hand from the knob.
10. Its steely gaze fixed on him as he chewed.
    -independent clause: It's steely gaze fixed on him
-adverbial subordinate clause: as he chewed.
11. When the sky fell, the earth turned blue.
    -independent clause: the earth turned blue
-adverbial subordinate clause: when the sky fell.
12. Unless they mistake us for burglars, we will be quite welcome to enter
    -independent clause: we will be quite welcome to enter
-adverbial subordinate clause: unless they mistake us for burglars.

# Adverb Clauses - Focus on Although, Though, Until, and Till

_Although_ and _though_ are two interchangeable words; _until_ and _till_ are also equal words. All we need to know is that both choices are available. Anytime we choose _although_, we could have chosen _though_; anytime we choose _until_, we could have choosen _till_.

Examples:
- He is too full of sleep to care, _although_ he knows his enemy is there.
- He is too full of sleep to care, _though_ he knows his enemy is there.
- The voice of La Muerte numbs them _until_ they leave wrinkled bodies of flowers withering on the stump.
- The voice of La Muerte numbs them _till_ they leave wrinkled bodies of flowers withering on the stump.

## Exercises

Each of the four compound sentences below contains a blank. Where you see the blanks, substitute one of the following subordinating conjunctions:
- although, though, till, until.
Use each subordinating conjunction one time only.
1. The summer is reluctant to go ,-although- the scythes hang in the apple trees.
2. Though the scythes hang in the apple trees, the summer is reluctant to go.
3. It was best to let Michael rest until he felt healthy and strong.
4. Till he felt healthy and strong, it was best to let Michael rest.

# Adverb Clauses - Focus on Since and So That

## SINCE
_Since_ has two meanings. One of it meanings is shared with _because_. _Because_, like _since_, is a subordinating conjunction; therefore, the two words can be interchangeable.

Examples:
- Alice cannot be in the poem _because_ she's only a metaphor.
- Alice cannot be in the poem _since_ she's only a metaphor.

_Since_ also means _from that time forward_. This is a meaning that _since_ does not share with any other subordinating conjunction.
- It has been thirty years _since_ I wrote you a letter.

## SO THAT
The subordinating conjunction _so that_ is easily mistaken for the coordinating conjunction _so_.
Examples:
- The mother has given herself up as prey _so that_ her babies can escape.
- The allosaurus fell heavily, _so_ the fossil he left was broken to bits.
One way to distinguish between _so_ and _so that_ is to determine intention. We use _so that_ when the action taken in the independent clause is intentional; we use _so_ when the action is not intentional.

In the examples above, the mother in the first example _intentionally_ gave herself up as prey; the allosaurus in the second example, however, did not fall intentionally. In both examples the content of the independent clause _causes_ the content of the subordinate clause; the difference is that the mother intended to cause the escape of her babies and the allosaurus did not intend to cause his broken skeleton.

In addition to the difference in intention, notice also that when _so_ joins two clauses it is punctuated with a comma; when _so that_ joins two clauses (while sitting between the clauses) it is not punctuated with a comma.

## Excercises
Each of the four compound sentences below contains a blank. Where you see the blanks, substitute either:
- comma + so [or]
- so that
1. I would turn down dinner invitations -so that- I could eat alone.
2. Surprisingly, they have done me no injury -, so- I am happy and dance and
sing.
3. The photos are hard to see -,so- we ask if they can be blown up to a larger
size.
4. The doctors drugged the children -so that- they wouldn’t fuss.
5. Their stingers have been removed-, so- I enter the swarm of yellow jackets
without harm.
6. Their stingers have been removed -so that- I can enter the swarm of yellow
jackets without harm.

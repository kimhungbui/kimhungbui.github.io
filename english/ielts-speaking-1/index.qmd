# Myths and misunderstanding in IELTS Speaking

## Mistaken ideas about the examiner's role

Myths and misunderstandings often come from misinterpreting facts about lELTS, or reaching a faulty conclusion based on resources that don't reflect the real test. This includes questions shared after a test, which lead to a common belief that the examiner asks everyone the same questions. IELTS would not be a fair or reliable test if this was true. Imagine a candidate at Band 3 being asked the same questions as one at Band 9. Such a test would be unfair to both test takers, with questions that would either be impossible for the lower-level candidate or would not allow the high-level candidate to show their full potential.


Another common source of confusion are the thousands of videos on platforms such as YouTube, many of which show 'mock interviews'. The table below shows some common features of these videos and the false impressions they can give.


| Common features of mock speaking test videos:                                                                         | Mistaken conclusions viewers often reach:                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| We are told the test taker's level before the test starts.                                                            | _'This test taker is 'Band 8', so this video must show a Band 8 level.'_                                                                                                                      |
| The 'examiner' reads a question, the 'test taker' talks as much as possible, then the 'examiner' asks a new question. | _'The candidate should start talking when the question ends and just keep going for as long as possible - it doesn't matter what you say because the 'examiner' ignores the answers anyway.'_ |
| Vocabulary is highlighted (especially idiomatic phrases) by showing words on the screen with a big green tick.        | _'The test taker got this high score because they used a lot of idiomatic phrases, so I need to do that too if I want to get the same score.'_                                                |

### Point to notice

- The score in these videos is usually based on the scored the candidate was awarded during a real test at some point in the past. This suggest that any person who has received Band 8 in a speaking test will always demonstrate this level when they talk. However, our IELTS certificate only shows the level we were able to reach in our test - it isn't a permanent stamp of authenticity. A sporting achievement is a useful analogy here. 

::: {.callout-tip}
If someone is awarded a Band 8 in Speaking, this shows they are capable of a very high level of speaking - it does not mean they are demonstrating the Band 8 speaking level whenever they talk.
:::

- The 'examiner' shown in the videos play a very passive role and doesn't appear to pay very much attention to the response of the 'candidate'. For example, they often ask a question that has already been answered, and never ask follow-up questions. In addition, the candidate is allowed to ramble on for as long as they want, often delivering mini lectures that appear to follow a '3-sentence' template. This gives a false impression of how an IELTS interview actually works.

I have often said that receiving a high score in any test does not make you an expert in language assessment or in how you achieved that score. In IELTS Speaking, the most common assumption is that a high score is due to the vocabulary used, especially idiomatic phrases. This idea is then presented as a model for 'Band 8' in many videos, where the speaker is allowed to give long unnatural answers, featuring as many idiomatic phrases as possible. As such, these videos do not represent a real test and no longer show the level the test taker was awarded in their actual test, where their examiner played a much more important role than 'the reader of questions'.


# How to think like an examiner

## The role of examiner

Real examiners have to undergo special training and standardization to ensure that each candidate is given the same opportunities to show their level. A key element of this training is understanding the interview process and the role of the examiner. Some of the key aspects of this role:

### Managing the time well

If too much time is spent on Part 1 or 2, a candidate will not have enough opportunities to show their higher-level skills in Part 3. To prevent this, examiners have to stick very strictly to the timings of the interview, and keep a discrete eye on the timer at all times.

### Controlling the interaction

Learned answers don't give any usable information and have to be ignored. To give every test taker the opportunity to show their _real_ value, examiners need to stop rehearsed speeches with a polite, '_Thank you_!' before asking a new question or moving on to the next part of the test.

The interview must feel as close to a natural conversation as possible. This means that, although they are given a script for each test, examiners need to adapt the questions so that they are appropriate to the level of the candidate and follow on naturally from what the candidate has said. This is particularly important in Part 3.

### Deciding on the Band score

Examiners need to be very familiar with the Band descriptors so that they can accurately apply them in the test. Throughout an interview, they must listen carefully for evidence to match the descriptors in each criteria, and must always refer back to these descriptors when assigning a score.

### Maintaining the standard

The interview is recorded to check that examiners are following the right interview procedure and applying the Band descriptors accurately. Outside of the test, examiners are regularly tested to ensure the accuracy of their scoring.

::: {.callout-tip}
In many of the videos showing 'mock tests', the candidate doesn't reach their full potential because they are allowed to talk for as long as they want and give mini speeches, while the 'examiner' plays a rather passive role and never asks any follow-up questions. In the real test, your examiner will not sit passively, reading a list of questions - they will interact with you and respond to what you say.

## Authentic examples of IELTS interviews

To see the difference between an authentic interview and those we often see on Youtube, compare the following extracts. The first is from a typical mock 'Band 8 interview' and the second is from an authentic interview shared on the IDP Youtube channel

### Mock 'Band 8' interview on Youtube

_Interviewer: How do people kepe awake when they are tired?_

_Candidate: Well, I think it goes without saying that the best defence against excessive sleepiness is definitely caffeine. This is a substance most commonly found in tea and coffee and it's said to have ... to make you more aware and give you a heightened sense of alertness to your surroundings. If you want to wake up feeling energized, then I think a cup of caffeeinated beverage is your go-to choice._

_Interviewer: Okay. Who do people feel tired a lot nowadays?_

_Candidate: Generally speaking, chronic fatigue is the result of enduring .. enduring lack of sleep and other physical and psychological factors. Some people suffer from a persistent sleeping disorder either genetically or from stress, so in this fast-paced world, people working longer hours and bite off more than they can chew, and that leaves little room for rest. This explains why some people show up at work looking all drained and weary._

### Extract form an authentic Band 8 interview

_Examiner: What are the advantages and disadvantages of being famous?_

_Candidate: Okay the advantages is that ... {the candidate explains the advantages}. The disadvantages is uh that you have to be diplomatically correct. At times, if there are certain things which are incorrect, still you have to go ahead and do that, which doesn't make sense because a lot of political leaders they ... they are into corruption er back in India and, er, well at times year there are some things which are wrongs, but they have to do it._

_Examiner: Why do they have to do it?_

_Candidate: Because there's a lot of political pressure and if they don't do it the political party
 would not support them and in the end they have to resign._

_Examiner: Do you think the media plays a role in that? What is the media's approach to reporting famous people?_

_Candidate: Well, the media plays an important role. At times ..._

## Point to notice

- In the IDP interview, the Band 8 candidate directly answers each question:

Examiner: What are the advantages and disadvantages ...

Candidate: The advantages are ...

The experienced, trained examiner listens carefully to each answer and responds with a follow-up question, creating a more natural exchange of ideas:

Candidate: ... at times year there are more some things are wrong,<u> but they have to do it.</u>

Examiner: <u>Why do they have to do it?</u>

- In contrast, in the first video, the 'test taker' does __not__ answer the specific question they are asked. Instead, they give unnatural, lecture-style responses, often using a 3-sentence pattern or template:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250720162610.png)
This may explain the belief that '_your ideas don't matter. so just say anything you like and talk for as long as you can_'.

- The person playing the 'examiner' role allows the 'candidate' to talk for as long as they want and doesn't engage with the responses: when the candidate finishes speaking, they simply ask a new question. In a real test (to encourage a more natural response and help the candidate show their real speaking ability) the examiner would have interrupted these speeches.

![](Pasted%20image%2020250720162826.png)

As the candidate mentioned '_physical and psychological factors_', the examiner could even have asked:

_What sort of physical and psychological factors might cause tiredness?_

This is the type of shared test question that can lead others to conclude that the examiner sometimes asks 'complicated' or 'tricky' questions. This also shows the problem with using as many 'high-level' words and phrases as possible: doing so can introduce complex ideas that you may struggle to discuss further.

:::{.callout-tip}
The examiner can easily spot learned answers and will interrupt long, unnatural speeches by asking a new question or a follow-up question. Don't introduce ideas that you cannot discuss in more detail simply to show off 'high-level' vocabulary.
:::

## How the examiner decides on our score

Throughout our test, the examiner is considering the different aspects of our spoken language and reaching a decision based on the Band descriptors. This means that our examiner is thinking about our level __at every stage of the test__.

Typically, an examiner will begin by setting a benchmark based on how you respond to the early test questions. So, after one or two questions, the examiner may be thinking. 'This candidate is at least a Band 6. At the end of Part 1, the examiner may have decided, 'Actually, this candidate could potentially be Band 7 or more Then, throughout your test, the examiner will look for confirmation of this level (as well as any possible indicators of an even higher (or lower) score) so that they can reach a firm decision by the end of the interview. Contrary to popular belief, your examiner wants to give you the highest score they can and is always looking for evidence to support this.

:::{.callout-tip}
The examiner is reaching a decision about our score at every point in the test. Our examiner wants to give us the highest score they can and they will continually look for evidence to support this.
:::

Different parts of the test can be useful in focusing on certain criteria. For example, in Part 1, your examiner may think more about pronunciation. Your responses in Part 2 provide more evidence of your Fluency and Coherence, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy, while Part 3 can help confirm whether all of these scores are accurate or should be even higher.

From the test-taker point of view, it might help to compare each of your answers to hitting a strength-testing machine with a hammer. Every response is a chance to register as high a score as possible on the scale. Unfortunately, many candidates waste these opportunities by giving prepared answers that the examiner has to ignore. This is like taking the hammer and hitting the sign, so no score registers:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250720164003.png)

If the examiner notices a particular problem (such as a grammatical mistake) they will listen to see if this is a systematic (repeated) error, or just a slip. If they notice a positive feature (such as good use of intonation or vocabulary) again they will listen to see if this is maintained. While some test takers can maintain a consistent level throughout, for others, their level may fluctuate - this is a sign that a candidate is on the way to the next level, but not quite there yet. 

Your overall score is not decided by the highest (or lowest) 'hits', as the image below shows, it is the consistency of your level that matters.

![](Pasted%20image%2020250720164100.png)

# Understanding the Band descriptors

Another important part of being an examiner is learning how to apply the different Band descriptors. Trainee examiners often begin with preconceived ideas of each Band and have to adiust these to become accredited. Similarv. teachers and test takers need to be sure that their own beliefs about the different levels are accurate have to adjust these to become accredited. Similarly, teachers and test takers need to be sure that their own beliefs about the different levels are accurate.

:::{.callout-tip}
The band descriptors can help you understand now to improve your score. However, it is important to check that your beliefs about the critical levels and criteria are accurate.
:::

## Applying the Band descriptors
 
 The examiner assesses your speaking performance in four criteria:

- Fluency and Coherence (F&C)
- Lexical Resource (LR)
- Grammatical Range and Accuracy (GRA)
- Pronunciation (P)

Many online sources reduce these criteria to the following oversimplified ideas:

- speaking quickly and without stopping, and giving long answers
- using high-level words and idiomatic language
- using a range of tenses
- having a native-speaker accent

If we use more reliable sources (e.g. the official IELTS Band descriptors and authentic interviews from the IDP YouTube channel), we can get a more detailed view of what the examiner is looking for in each criterion, and set key goals to help improve your score.

::: {.callout.tip}
We can use the Band descriptors to set key goals to improve your score. However, it's important to note that they describe both positive and negative features, so they are not all goals you should aim for.
:::

## Discrimination

In language assessment, the words 'discrimination' and 'discriminate' are used to mean '_judging the quality of something based on what makes it different from something else_'. It is extremely important for examiners to be able to discriminate between speech at different Bands. In other words, to understand the qualities that make Band 7 different from Band 6 and so on. Below, I have explained the elements that allow the examiner to discriminate between different Bands in each criterion.

## Understand Fluency and Coherence

The points in the Fluency and Coherence band descriptors are organised into 1) elements of Fluency (e.g. hesitation and the ability to keep talking) and 2) Coherence (relevance, comprehensibility, and linking of ideas). 

I have summarised the main points at each level in the table below:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250720164735.png)

### The difference between Fluency and Coherence

A useful way to think of fluency is <u>how easy it is for the speaker to express their ideas at length</u> on different topics, while coherence refers to <u>how easy it is for the listener to understand what you are saying</u>, and how well your ideas are connected. If you came out of your test thinking, 'I gave really long answers', and are confused why your F&C score was only Band 6, this should tell you that the examiner may not have always been able to follow your ideas or the connections between your ideas. If you struggled to keep going at times, the strategies you used to help you can have an impact on this score. For example, relying too much on repetition, self-correction, and fillers can lower your F&C score. 

Look at the following example from a video on the IDP YouTube channel, where a Band 6 candidate is talking about famous people in the past:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250720165532.png)

This is a good example of 'less flexibility' - the candidate is using the words they know but the listener doesn't always know exactly what they mean (e.g. '_new logics_') and there are inaccuracies in terms of collocation ('_new way about building_', should be _'new ways to build something'_).

In contrast, in the Band 7 extract, we can clearly follow the speaker's ideas.

:::{.callout-note}
An important distinction between Band 6 and Bands 7+ is that we can always understand what the higher-level candidates intend to say but at Band 6 the meanine is sometimes unclear.
:::

### Points to notice about Lexical

- This criterion assesses whether you have sufficient language to be able to discuss a range of topics without needing to repeat the same words.
- At the lower levels (Band 3 / 4) test takers only have enough language to talk about the most familiar topics, errors are frequent, and they will repeat words rather than paraphrasing.
- By band 6, a test taker has enough language to be able to __attempt__ to discuss unfamiliar topics. However, they are not always successful when it comes to parahprase.
- To reach Bands 7 and above, test takers must show they have enough language to discuss any topic at length, use paraphrase effectively (so that they are not always repeating their own or the examiner's words), and show some ability to use less common and idiomatic language with an awareness of style and collocation. This is more accurate, skillful, and precise at Band 8, and more sustained at Band 9.
- Problems in vocabulary can affect our Fluency and Coherence if we:
	- Need to pause to think of the right word (reducing fluency)
	- Use as many idiomatic phrases as we can (reducing coherence)

:::{.callout-tip}
Idiomatic and less common language will be rewarded __if__ it is appropriate, accurate, and helps to make our meaning clear when discussing a specific topic.
:::

# Understanding Grammatical Range and Accuracy

Grammar is a very important element in creating meaning. Again, it helps to see this criteria in terms of the impact it has on the listener. In the Band descriptors, the points describe (1) the range of structured used, (2) the accuracy of structures used, and (3) the impact any errors have on meaning or comprehensibility.

![](Pasted%20image%2020250729145657.png)

### Points to notice about Grammatical and Accuracy

At lowest level (Bands 3-4), complex structures are not attempted. This has an impact on fluency because it means that test takers are only able to give short answers. At Bands 5 and 6, although there are attempts at more complex structures (though longer answers), these are generally limited to the same repeated structures, and errors are frequent. We can see this in the Band 5.5 extract we saw earlier:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250729155323.png)

- At Bands 5 and 6, candidates may need to stop and correct a grammatical point or think about how to formulate language, which can interfere with Fluency and coherence. Coherence problems also occur if candidates try to follow that is often called the 'PPF' templates (answering using the present, past, and future tenses).
- The link between the length of an answer and complexity of grammar shows that 'complex structures' will naturally occur when we given a en explanation, expand on idea, or explain how different ideas are connected. At band 7 - 9, test takers will use a range of structures to do this, with few (Band 7) or rare errors (Bands 8 - 9).

# Understanding Pronunciation

The pronunciation descriptors highlight (1) the range of features we use, (2) whether these features are sustained or not, and (3) how easy it is for the listener to understand what we are saying. Thus, as with the other criteria, pronunciation is assessed based on range, accuracy, and the impact it has on the listener.

The following specific pronunciation features are mentioned: _rhythm, stress, intonation, chunking, stress-timing,_ and _pronunciation of individual sounds._ Importantly, the majority of these features describe ___connected speech___ rather than in individual words. Our accent is only mentioned in connection with its impact on the different pronunciation features.

![](Pasted%20image%2020250729155951.png)

## Points to notice about Pronunciation

- Although many people try to speak quickly to improve their fluency, speed often causes issues in pronunciation and is mentioned at Band 6.
- Individual sounds can be a problem from Bands 1 to 6, so these are important address. However, we cannot reach Bands 7-9 unless we also develop skills related to rhythm, stress, intonation, chunking, and stress-timing (all aspects of connected speech).
- Higher level candidates vary their use of stress and intonation to help convey precise meaning.
- As with LR and GRA, there is some overlap between Pronunciation and Fluency and Coherence

# Summary: deciding on our score

To arrive at an appropriate Band score, throughout our test, the examiner is thinking about:

:::{.callout-tip}
## The language we produce
- How easy (or difficult) it is for us to answer fully
- Whether we can discuss only limited topics or a variety of topics
- Whether the language we produce is limited (and repetitive) or varied.
- Whether the language we produce has frequent noticeable errors or is largely accurate.
:::

:::{.callout-tip}
## The impact of our language has on the listener
- How much effort is needed by the listener to understand our language and follow our ideas.
- Whether our use of grammar/ vocabulary/ pronunciation makes our ideas easier or more difficult to understand.
- Whether our use of grammar/ vocabulary/ pronunciation makes our meaning more or less clear and precise

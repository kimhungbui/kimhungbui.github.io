# Question

_Due to television and the internet it is easier today for a large number of people to become famous. Is this a positive or negative development?_

David Lang;

It is easier than ever today for people to become famous because of increased channels for distribution such as television and the internet. This is clearly a positive trend as it opens up the entertainment industry to greater diversity.

Those who decry this trend typically to talentless celebrities. In the past, a comedian or musician might work for years honing their craft in order to get a slot on one of the few talkshows and then become famous overnight. Nowadays, many celebrities start on reality TV or a YouTube channel and do not have any discernible talents. The socialite Paris Hilton was one of the first to take advantage of her wealth who through dating celebrities and canny use of social media and television was able to become a celebrity in her own right.

Despite the aforementioned cases, this is on a whole a positive trend because of the more diverse range of famous people today. Fame used to be the prerogative of white men and women, with the occasional exception from an ethnic group. One of the reasons for this is that whites typically come from more privileged backgrounds and have greater opportunities, thereby making up a disproportionate share of success stories. The internet in particular has leveled the playing field to an extent. Anyone with a smartphone today has the ability to broadcast their talents and cultivate a loyal fanbase, regardless of gender or ethnicity and without the barriers that existed in the past such as ingrained reluctance from authority figures to give certain ethnicities an honest chance.

In conclusion, there are clear cultural drawbacks to the ease with which many achieve fame but today it is nonetheless more inclusive. A greater concern should be the age at which people become famous as it can have developmental side effects.

ChatGPT:

In today's digital age, becoming famous is easier than ever due to the explosion of online platforms and television opportunities. While some see this as a democratization of fame, it is, in reality, a negative development that has diminished the value of talent, effort, and cultural depth.

Fame today is often disconnected from genuine ability. In the past, achieving celebrity status typically required years of dedication to a particular craft. A musician, for instance, might have spent decades perfecting their skills before getting a rare shot on a major talk show. This long road filtered out the mediocre and ensured that fame reflected a certain level of excellence. By contrast, many modern celebrities rise to prominence through reality TV or social media, sometimes without any identifiable talent. Paris hilton is prime example, became a household name not because of any specific talent, but because of her social status and media presence. Similarly, Kim Kardashian built a brand through strategic use of television and social media, not through traditional artistic or professional success.

This shift also sends a harmful message to younger generations: that fame can be achieved without effort or substance. As a result, more people may value visibility over personal development or hard work. In previous decades, fame was generally linked to expertise or originality - actors, musicians, writers, and athletes were admired for what they did, not just who they were. Today, however, social media influencers can gain millions of followers by simply being entertaining or attractive online. This can create unrealistic aspirations and encourage superficiality. Furthermore, the psychological impact of sudden fame, especially among young people, cannot be ignored. Many find themselves under intense pressure to maintain their online image, which can lead to mental health challenges such as anxiety, stress, and loss of identity.

In conclusion, although more people now have the opportunity to become famous, the way fame is achieved today often undermines the importance of talent, discipline, and meaningful contribution. This is a negative development that not only lowers cultural standards but also risks harming individuals who are unprepared for the realities of public life. Rather than celebrating fame for its own sake, society should place more value on substance and long-term achievement.

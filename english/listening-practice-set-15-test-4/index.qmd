| Q3       | STEUNFIRTS  | STAUNFIRTH     | Spelling   | Misheard "AU" as "EU" and "TH" as "TS" | Write letters exactly as spelled, re-check order |

1. Nature of the mistake

You wrote "STEUNFIRTS" instead of "STAUNFIRTH".

This is a spelling accuracy issue in a Listening Form Completion question.

The audio clearly spelled it out: S-T-A-U-N-F-I-R-T-H.

You transposed letters ("E" instead of "A" and "S" instead of "H").

2. Why it happened

Spelling under pressure: In IELTS Listening, names—especially unusual ones—often trip people up because they're not in everyday vocabulary.

Letter confusion:

"AU" sound in “Staun-” might have sounded like "EU" to you.

Final “-th” might have sounded like “-ts” due to accent or fast pronunciation.

Not actively writing while hearing the spelling: If you only listen without visualising the word in your head letter-by-letter, errors creep in.

No quick check: Since the speaker spelled it, you could have matched your writing to the audio in real time.

3. Skills involved

Spelling unusual words (especially names and place names)

Listening to letter sequences accurately

Linking sounds to correct English letter combinations (AU, TH, etc.)

4. How to avoid in future

When a word is spelled in the audio:

Write each letter as you hear it—don't try to write the whole word from memory first.

Say the letters in your head as you write (S…T…A…U…N…).

Check letter order before moving on.

Practice listening to spelled words:

Names: towns, people, brands

Especially with British accents, since “A” might sound like “eh” and “U” like “yoo” or “uh”.

Know common UK place name patterns:

“-th” endings, “AU” in “Staun-”, “-firth” meaning estuary.

## Q21

**Question:** What did Annie discover from reading about icehouses?  
**Correct:** **B. how the ice was kept frozen**

**Transcript cue:**

> “But I **didn’t realise** that **insulating the blocks with straw or sawdust** meant they didn’t melt for months.”

- She already **knew** where they were built (location), so **C** is out.
    
- She didn’t talk about why they were first created, so **A** is out.
    
- Her **new discovery** = the **method** of keeping ice frozen → **B**.
    

## Q25

**Question:** Who will research **the goods that are refrigerated**?  
**Correct:** **A. Annie**  
(You put B = Jack.)

**Transcript cues (assignment language):**

> **Annie:** “How about starting with … the **range of goods that are refrigerated** nowadays? … **I could do that**, unless you particularly want to.”  
> **Jack:** “**That’s fine by me**.”

- “**I could do that**” → Annie volunteers.
    
- “**That’s fine by me**” → Jack **doesn’t** take it.  
    ⇒ Topic **stays with Annie** → **A**.
    

---

## Patterns behind the mistakes

- **Q21 (detail meaning):** You chose the **topic around it** (location/creation) rather than the **new information** signaled by “**didn’t realise**”. In IELTS Listening, phrases like _didn’t realise / I learned / I found out_ point to the **answerable discovery**.
    
- **Q25 (speaker assignment):** It’s an **ownership** trap. The test uses soft language: _“I could do that… unless…”_ + acceptance _“That’s fine by me.”_ → That confirms the first speaker **keeps** the task.
    

---

## Quick fix strategies

1. **Underline “discovery verbs”:** didn’t realise / found out / discovered → answer is what follows.
    
2. **Map assignments live:** Draw A / B columns. When someone says “**I’ll do that / I could do that**,” put a tick for that topic under their name; when the other says “**fine by me / OK / leave it to me**,” confirm the tick.
    
3. **Beware topic switches:** After Q25, they immediately **change topic** to **health**. Don’t let the new topic overwrite the **previous assignment**.

## Mini drill (1‑line practice)

Who owns the task?

1. “I can cover the **case studies** if you like.” – “Perfect, thanks.” → **First speaker**
    
2. “Do you want the **budget section**?” – “Not really.” – “OK, **I’ll take it**.” → **Second speaker** (final line)
    
3. “I’ll start the **timeline**, **unless** you’d prefer to.” – “No, go ahead.” → **First speaker**

## **1. Signal phrases for assignment**

These are grouped by who **ends up** with the task.

### **A. First speaker keeps the task**

- _I could do that (unless you want to)._
    
- _I’ll take that one._
    
- _I don’t mind doing it._
    
- _I’ll cover that._
    
- _I can handle that._
    
- _I’m happy to do it._
    
- _Go ahead and leave it with me._
    

**Confirming responses from second speaker:**

- _That’s fine by me._
    
- _Sure, thanks._
    
- _OK._
    
- _Yes, you do that._
    

---

### **B. Second speaker takes the task**

- _Do you want to do that?_ – _Sure, I’ll do it._
    
- _Would you like to take that on?_ – _Yes, I’ll handle it._
    
- _If you’d like, you can do that._ – _OK, I will._
    
- _I’d rather not, could you?_ – _Yeah, I’ll do it._
    

---

### **C. Watch for switches**

Sometimes they _start_ with “I could do it” but then _switch_ when the other says “Actually, I’d prefer to.”  
➡ Whoever **verbally accepts last** ends up with it.

## **2. 5 mini practice questions**

**Example 1**  
S1: _I can do the background research if you want._  
S2: _Thanks, that’d be great._  

**Example 2**  
S1: _Do you want to write the introduction?_  
S2: _Yes, I’ll do it._  

**Example 3**  
S1: _I could handle the graphs unless you’d prefer to._  
S2: _No, you go ahead._  

**Example 4**  
S1: _I’m not too keen on covering the statistics._  
S2: _OK, I’ll take it._  

**Example 5**  
S1: _I’ll start the budget analysis._  
S2: _Actually, I’d like to do that._

✅ **Answer:** First speaker

✅ **Answer:** Second speaker
3
✅ **Answer:** First speaker
4
✅ **Answer:** Second speaker
5
✅ **Answer:** Second speaker (because of the switch)



# Recording 4


1) Exact evidence from the transcript

The sentence reads:

“A major step toward large‑scale commercial soapmaking occurred in 1791, when a French chemist, Nicholas Leblanc, patented a process for turning salt into soda ash (Q38), or sodium carbonate.”

So the speaker explicitly says “turning salt into soda ash.” The word you must fill is SALT.

2) Why your answer “SOAPS” is wrong

Doesn't match the spoken phrase. The speaker mentions soap several times elsewhere, which can be a distractor, but here the verb phrase is “turning ___ into …” — the thing being turned into soda ash is salt, not soap.

Makes no logical sense in context. Soda ash (sodium carbonate) is an alkali used to make soap; you don't make soda ash from soap. The passage later explains that soda ash combines with fat to form soap — so soap comes after, not before.

Grammatical fit. The notes ask “making soda ash from ___” so the missing word is a raw material (a substance): salt fits perfectly.

3) How this mistake likely happened

You heard nearby words like soap / soapmaking and jumped to that as the answer (a common trap).

You may have missed the short but crucial phrase “turning salt into…”, or mis-copied during note-taking.

4) How to avoid this in future (practical tips)

Pre‑read the question and predict the type of word needed (here: a substance/noun).

Listen for connecting words like into / from / by — they show transformation or source. (“turning X into Y” → X is the source).

Underline nearby keywords in the transcript while listening (e.g., turning…into, soda ash).

Don't be fooled by repeated topic words (e.g., soap). Check the exact sentence for the answer.

Take minimal notes (1–2 letters) of the key word when you hear it — faster than trying to write the whole word immediately.

If you're unsure, use logic: ask whether the proposed answer makes sense in the sequence described (what comes before and after).

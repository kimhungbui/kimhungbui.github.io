🎯 Theme:
Loneliness and perseverance at the start of the journey.
A quiet morning. The main character begins another study day while carrying the weight of emotional wounds.

🪟 Section 1: Opening Scene
Mood: Stillness, quiet, slight anxiety
Place: Tiny rented room in a big city (maybe HCMC), early morning

The alarm buzzes at 5:30 AM.

He sits up on a thin mattress. His desk is full of papers.

The sun hasn't risen. The city is still asleep.

Coffee boils in a small metal pot. The sound is the only thing breaking the silence.

(Possible line)
“Outside, the world slept. Inside, he fought another silent battle — one more morning, one more step.”

🕰️ Section 2: Flashback or Reflection
He sees the photo of his girlfriend and him on the phone.

Thinks about the last time he truly laughed — maybe when she was beside him.


That moment of hope when he first opened a textbook on AI and believed in a better future.

“Love was warm. But it faded. Study was hard. But it stayed.”

✉️ Section 3: Small Action or Event
He checks his phone: one academic rejection email.

Then, a message from an old friend: “You still trying that PhD thing?”

He sighs. But then, he opens the GRE prep book anyway.

Chooses a difficult passage to read aloud in English.

🧠 Section 4: Internal Growth or Setback
He almost breaks down reading aloud, but he doesn’t.

Recalls his ex’s words: “You’re emotionally too soft for academia.”

He clenches his fist. He writes a quote on a post-it:
“Strong is quiet. Brave is small. But still continues.”

Pins it to the wall.

🌫️ Section 5: Chapter Close
He opens the window. Fog outside.

The sky turns a pale orange.

He whispers: “One day… one day I’ll make it.”

The city begins to wake up. But for him, it already began.

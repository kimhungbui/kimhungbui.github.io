# in 2 kind, which is better for longevity

For longevity, both cardio and strength training offer unique but complementary benefits, and the best approach is to combine them.

### Benefits of Cardio for Longevity

- Cardio enhances heart and lung health, improves cardiovascular fitness, lowers blood pressure, and reduces risks of heart disease and type 2 diabetes.
- Higher aerobic fitness is strongly linked to longer life expectancy, with studies showing 24% to 34% reduced mortality risk from regular moderate to vigorous aerobic exercise.[^1][^2]


### Benefits of Strength Training for Longevity

- Strength training builds and maintains muscle mass and bone density, which are crucial for mobility, reducing frailty, and preventing falls in older adults.
- It improves metabolism, reduces risk of chronic diseases, and is associated with 9% to 22% reduced mortality risk.
- Strength training also helps maintain independence and quality of life by preventing age-related muscle loss (sarcopenia).[^3][^4][^1]


### Combined Approach for Best Results

- Research shows a combination of both strength training and cardio reduces mortality risk the most, with a 41% to 47% lower risk of death compared to no exercise.
- Combining the two addresses heart, muscle, bone, metabolic, and cognitive health, supporting a longer and healthier life.[^2][^5][^1]


### Which Is Better?

- If choosing only one, cardio may better reduce cardiovascular risk and extend lifespan.
- Strength training is essential for maintaining muscle strength, preventing frailty, and bone health.
- The ideal for longevity is to do regular cardio plus at least two sessions of strength training weekly.

In summary, a balanced exercise routine incorporating both cardio and strength training is superior for longevity versus one or the other alone, maximizing health benefits across multiple body systems.[^3][^1][^2]

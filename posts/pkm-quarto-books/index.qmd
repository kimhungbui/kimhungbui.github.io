If you're building a Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) system using Quarto, and you want to combine a central website with multiple structured books (like "Convex Optimization", "Statistics", etc.), this guide shows you the best practices to:

Organize your folder structure

Set up separate Quarto projects

Render efficiently without duplication

Publish to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions

You can use my PKM for easier to begin: 

# PKM Structure Overview

My knowledge system follow this hierarchy:


Subject → Book → Chapter → Section

For example:

- Subject: Mathematics
    - Book: Convex Optimization
        - Chapter: Convex Sets
            - Sections: Definitions, Examples, Properties


# Create the PKM Project and Books

## Create the root website

```{bash}
quarto create project website
```

write <yourname>.github.io for dir



```{bash}
cd <yourname>.github.io
```

It generates:

```
<yourname>.github.io/
├── _quarto.yml
├── index.qmd
```

## Create subject folders

```{bash}
mkdir -p math
cd math
quarto create project book
```

This generates:

```
math/convex-optimization/
├── _quarto.yml
├── index.qmd
├── intro.qmd
```

## Define Book Structure

Edit `math/convex-optimization/_quarto.yml`:

```yaml
project:
  type: book
  output-dir: ../../docs/math/convex-optimization

book:
  title: "Convex Optimization"
  author: "<your name>"
  chapters:
    - index.qmd
    - intro.qmd
    - convex-set.qmd
    - convex-func.qmd

format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
```

Each `.qmd` file is a **chapter**. Inside each chapter, use `##` and `###` for **sections**.

## Connect Books from the Website

Edit `<yourname>.github.io/_quarto.yml`:

```yaml
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: docs

website:
  title: "<your name>'s PKM"
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - text: Mathematics
        menu:
          - text: Convex Optimization
            href: math/convex-optimization/
          - text: Statistics
            href: math/statistics/
      - text: English
        menu:
          - text: Speaking
            href: english/speaking/

format:
  html:
    theme:
      light: flatly
      dark: darkly
    toc: true
```

## Preview and Render

To preview a single book:

```bash
cd math/convex-optimization
quarto preview
```

To preview the full site:

```bash
quarto preview
```

It will view book as website.

If you want to preview full site with books, we will render site before, and after that, render book. So old file of website-books will be replaced by book file.

## (Optional) Github-actions for Publishing

Happy building your knowledge system!

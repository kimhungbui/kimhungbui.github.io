# Bernoulli Distribution

The **Bernoulli distribution** is a discrete probability distribution that models the outcome of a single trial with two possible outcomes: success (1) and failure (0).

---

## 📌 1. Definition

A **Bernoulli random variable** \( X \) takes the value:
- \( X = 1 \) with probability \( p \) (success),
- \( X = 0 \) with probability \( 1 - p \) (failure).

Mathematically, the probability mass function (PMF) is given by:
$$
P(X = x) = p^x (1 - p)^{1 - x}, \quad x \in \{0, 1\}, \ 0 \leq p \leq 1.
$$

## ⚡ 2. Properties of the Bernoulli Distribution

### 🎯 Mean (Expected Value)
The mean represents the expected outcome of the random variable:
$$
E[X] = p.
$$

We expected value $E(x)$ of a random variable $X$ is given by:
$$
E(X) = \sigma x \dot P(X = x)
$$
For a Bernoulli random variable:
$$
E(X) = 1 \dot p + 0 \dot( 1 - p) = p
$$

### 🎲 Variance
The variance measures how much the outcomes deviate from the mean:
$$
\operatorname{Var}(X) = p(1 - p).
$$
The variance of a random variable $X$ measures how much the values of $X$ deviate from its mean:
$$
Var(X) = E[(X-E(X))^2]
$$
expand this:
$$
Var(X) = E(X^2 - 2pX + p^2)
$$
Since $p^2$ is constant and $E(X)= p$, we have:
$$
Var(X) = E(X^2) - 2pE(X) + p^2
$$

For a Bernoulli variable, $X^2 = X$ (because $1^2 = 1$ and $0^2=0$):
$$
E(X^2) = E(X) = p
$$
Substituting back, 
$$
Var(X) = p - 2p^2 + p = p - p^2 = p(1)
$$
### 📝 Standard Deviation
The standard deviation is the square root of the variance:
$$
\sigma = \sqrt{p(1 - p)}.
$$

### 📏 Skewness
Skewness measures the asymmetry of the distribution:
$$
\gamma_1 = \frac{1 - 2p}{\sqrt{p(1 - p)}}.
$$

### 🛡️ Kurtosis
The kurtosis of the Bernoulli distribution is:
$$
\gamma_2 = \frac{1 - 6p(1 - p)}{p(1 - p)}.
$$


### Variance of the Estimator $\hat{p}$

The estimator for $p$ based on $n$ independent observations $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ is the **sample mean**:

$$
\hat{p}_n = \frac{1}{n}\sigma^{n}_{i=1}X_i.
$$


## 📚 3. Key Characteristics

- **Domain:** \( x \in \{0, 1\} \).
- **Parameter:** Single parameter \( p \), where \( 0 \leq p \leq 1 \).
- **Support:** The distribution is defined on two points: 0 and 1.
- **Memoryless:** The Bernoulli distribution is **not** memoryless.
- **Special Case:**  
  - If \( p = 0.5 \), the distribution is symmetric.
  - If \( p \neq 0.5 \), the distribution is skewed.

## 🔗 4. Relationship to Other Distributions

- **Binomial Distribution:**  
  The Bernoulli distribution is a special case of the **Binomial distribution** with \( n = 1 \):
  $$
  \text{Bernoulli}(p) = \text{Binomial}(n=1, p).
  $$

- **Geometric Distribution:**  
  A geometric random variable models the number of Bernoulli trials until the first success.

- **Beta Distribution (Conjugate Prior):**  
  In Bayesian statistics, the Beta distribution is the conjugate prior for the Bernoulli likelihood.

## 🌐 5. Applications of the Bernoulli Distribution

- **Modeling Binary Outcomes:**  
  - Coin flips (Heads/Tails)
  - Pass/Fail tests
  - Yes/No survey responses
  - On/Off states in systems

- **Machine Learning:**  
  - Logistic regression for binary classification.
  - Bernoulli Naive Bayes classifiers.

- **Statistical Inference:**  
  - Estimating proportions (e.g., percentage of people supporting a policy).

## 💻 6. Python Example: Simulating a Bernoulli Random Variable

```python
import numpy as np

# Parameters
p = 0.7  # Probability of success
n = 1000  # Number of trials

# Simulate Bernoulli trials
data = np.random.binomial(n=1, p=p, size=n)

# Estimating p
p_estimate = np.mean(data)

print(f"True probability p: {p}")
print(f"Estimated probability p̂: {p_estimate:.4f}")
```

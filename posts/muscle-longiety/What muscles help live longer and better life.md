Muscles that significantly help in living a longer and better life include skeletal muscle mass and strength, particularly in the legs, core, and overall body. Having greater muscle mass and strength is associated with lower all-cause mortality, better cardiovascular and metabolic health, improved mobility, balance, and independence as people age.

### Role of Muscle Mass and Strength in Longevity

- Greater muscle mass relative to body size is independently linked to lower mortality risk in older adults, beyond traditional cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors. Muscle mass acts as a vital protein reserve and supports survival during illness.[^1][^2]
- Muscle strength, more than just muscle size, strongly predicts longevity, reducing mortality risks even when other negative metabolic or health factors are present.[^3][^4]
- Maintaining muscle mass supports healthy aging by preventing sarcopenia (age-related muscle loss), preserving mobility, stability, and reducing the risk of falls and injuries, all of which contribute to a better quality of life and lifespan.[^5][^6][^7]


### Important Muscle Groups for Longevity

- **Leg Muscles:** Strong leg muscles are crucial as they support mobility, balance, and stability. Studies show people with stronger legs have lower mortality risk due to better cardiovascular health, blood flow, and metabolic function.[^8]
- **Core Muscles:** Including those of the lower back, hips, and abdomen, core muscles support posture, reduce back pain, and improve overall balance and function, which are vital for maintaining independence with age.[^9]


### Benefits of Strength Training

- Muscle-strengthening activities, including weightlifting, resistance training, squats, push-ups, and even functional movements like carrying heavy loads, help build and maintain muscle mass and strength.[^10][^11]
- These activities improve insulin sensitivity, glucose management, metabolic rate, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers.[^12][^13]
- Just 30 to 60 minutes per week of muscle-strengthening exercise can increase life expectancy by 10 to 17 percent.[^4]

In summary, building and maintaining strong skeletal muscles, especially in the legs and core, through regular strength training is key to living longer and better by promoting metabolic health, mobility, and resilience against age-related health declines.[^1][^8][^4]

<p>The plans show the public park as it was opened in 1920 and the current layout following its redevelopment. Overall, while almost all facilities have changed, the new layout prioritizes to serve for dense activities, making the park more modern and family-oriented.</p>
<p>In the past, the park consisted of many facilities for relaxing and had several seats around. There were two entrances from 2 Street, a fountain in the middle, stages for musicians, and two rose gardens on the west side. On the east side of the park, there was were rose garden, a pond for water plants, and a glasshouse. In addition, there were several seats around the edge of the park.</p>
<p>Following the renovations, only the west rose garden and the two entrances remain the same, and a new entrance underground carpark has been added to the east side of the park. The fountain has been removed to make way for a rose garden, and all seats around the park have been moved to the center. On the west side, the old stage for musicians is replaced by an amphitheater, while just one rose garden still remains. These include a cafe, a children’s play area, and a water feature on the east side, replacing the rose garden, the pond for water land, and the glasshouse.</p>

<p>The plans show a public park as it appeared when it first opened in 1920 and its current layout after redevelopment. Overall, while most original facilities have been replaced, the park has been redesigned to cater to more active and family-oriented recreation.</p>
<p>In 1920, the park mainly provided spaces for relaxation. There were two entrances from Arnold Avenue and Eldon Street, with a fountain in the center. To the west, visitors could find a stage for musicians and two rose gardens, while the east side contained another rose garden, a pond for water plants, and a glasshouse. Benches were also placed around the edges of the park for people to sit.</p>
<p>Today, only the two original entrances and the western rose garden remain unchanged, and an additional entrance leading to an underground car park has been added on the east side. The central fountain has been replaced by a large rose garden with seating around it. On the west side, the old bandstand has been converted into an amphitheater. Meanwhile, the eastern side has undergone the most dramatic transformation: the pond, rose garden, and glasshouse have been removed and replaced with a cafe, a children’s play area, and a water feature.</p>

<p>In the past, the park contained several features for relaxation. There were two entrances from Arnold Avenue and Eldon Street, a fountain in the middle, a stage for musicians, and two rose gardens on the left side. On the right side, there was another rose garden, a pond for water plants, and a glasshouse. In addition, seats were placed around the edges of the park.</p>
<p>Following the renovations, only the rose garden on the left and the two original entrances remain unchanged, with a new underground car park entrance added to the right-hand side. The central fountain has been replaced by another rose garden, and all the seats have been moved to the center of the park. On the left, the old stage for musicians has been converted into an amphitheater, while the right side now includes a café, a children’s play area, and a water feature, replacing the former rose garden, pond, and glasshouse.</p>
<hr>
<p>The plans show a public park when it first opened in 1920 and how it looks today after redevelopment. Overall, while most original features have either been replaced or relocated, the park now provides a wider range of facilities for recreation, especially for families.</p>
<p>In 1920, the park was largely designed for relaxation and quiet leisure. A fountain stood at the center, surrounded by seats, with rose gardens in both the west and east corners. On the west side, there was a pond for water plants. Two entrances connected to the park to Arnold Avenue and Eldon Street.</p>
<p>Currently, the central fountain has been replaced by a rose garden with seating, and most other features have been modernized. The stage for musicians has been redeveloped into an amphitheater for concerts, while the pond, glasshouse, and eastern rose garden have all been replaced with a cafe, a children’s play area, and a water feature. The original entrances remain, but a new underground car park has been added to the east.</p>

<p>The diagrams below show the layout of a public library now and the plans for its redevelopment.</p>
<p>Now(current Library layout)</p>
<p>Central reading room</p>
<p>Small reception at entrance</p>
<p>Book shelves on left and right sides</p>
<p>Study tables at the back</p>
<p>One computer room (next to reception)</p>
<p>Planned Redevelopment</p>
<p>Larger reception moved to center</p>
<p>Cafe added near entrance</p>
<p>More computers (two new computer labs replacing one side of bookshelves)</p>
<p>Children’s area and story corner replacing study tables</p>
<p>Fewer shelves but more digital resources kiosks</p>
<p>Plan</p>
<p>Intro</p>
<p>Paraphrase task -&gt; The plans illustrate how a public library is set to be transformed.</p>
<p>Overview -&gt; highlight main changes (shift from books -&gt; digital, social facilities like cafe/ children’s area)</p>
<p>Paragraph 1 (Current)</p>
<p>Describe present features in logical oder (entrance -&gt; reception -&gt; shelves -&gt; study area -&gt; computer room)</p>
<p>Paragraph 2 (Future)</p>
<p>Describe new features and changes in same order (entrance -&gt; reception -&gt; cafe -&gt; computer labs -&gt; children’s area -&gt; kiosks)</p>
<p>Conclusion/overall</p>
<p>One clear sentence: “Overall, the library will become more modern and family-oriented, with fewer traditional books and more digital/communal spaces.”</p>
<hr>
<p>The plans illustrate how a public library is set to be transformed after redevelopment. Overall, while traditional book storage will be reduced, the new layout will prioritize digital learning and community spaces, making the library more modern and family-friendly.</p>
<p>At present, the library consists of a central reading room with a small reception immediately inside the entrance. Bookshelves occupy both the left and the right sides of the building, while study tables are located at the back. In addition, there is a single computer room next to the reception area.</p>
<p>Following the renovations, the reception will be relocated to the center of the building and significantly expanded. A cafe will be added near the entrance, providing a space for visitors to relax. The left-hand side of the library will be converted into two computer laboratories, replacing the existing bookshelves. At the rear, the study tables will be removed to make room for a children’s area, including a story corner. Meanwhile, the right-hand side will contain fewer shelves, with several digital resource kiosks added instead.</p>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>The word ‘fish’ is generally used as an uncountable noun (the plural ‘fishes’ is only used rarely to refer to different fish species). This includes different types of fish such as tuna, salmon, etc. So we can say ‘<em>the tuna swim</em>’, not “<em>the tunas swim</em>”</p>
<p>We can use the word to mean one fish: <em>the salmon swims</em> or several fish: <em>the salmon swim</em>.</p>
<p>NB Whales and dolphins are mammals and are countable nouns.</p>

<h2 data-number="1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="language-used-in-process-task"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Language used in process task</h2>
<p>We may need to describe:</p>
<p><em>time, different stages, physical changes, movement</em></p>

<section id="period-of-time" class="level2" data-number="1.2">
<h2 data-number="1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="period-of-time"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Period of time</h2>
<p>often saying how long a stage or step in a process <strong>takes</strong> or <strong>lasts</strong>, or how much time is <strong>spent</strong> <em>in a place</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>This stage <strong>lasts</strong> for four years.</em></li>
<li><em>The fry <strong>spend</strong> four years in the upper river.</em></li>
<li><em>It <strong>took</strong> five years to complete the renovations.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>With our current task, we cannot say: ‘<em>The salmon eggs <strong>take</strong> 5-6 months <strong>to break out of their eggs</strong></em>’, because we do not know how long this specific process takes and it is unlikely to take up 6 months for the fish to break out of their eggs.</p>
<p><strong>Phase, period, stage</strong>, and <strong>time</strong> are useful synonyms to use here, but be careful with the prepositions <strong>at</strong> and <strong>during</strong>. <strong>Phase</strong> and <strong>time</strong> can refer to either a length of time or point of time, and so we can use both <em>during</em> and <em>at</em> with these:</p>
<ul>
<li>During this phase NOT <del>at this phase</del></li>
<li>During this period NOT <del>at this period</del></li>
<li>During this stage, at this stage</li>

<h2 data-number="1.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="describing-physical-changes"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Describing physical changes</h2>
<p>We can use the following verbs to describe the physical changes that occur in a natural process:</p>
<p><em>Become, change, develop, grow, turn into</em></p>
<p>They are used slightly differently</p>
<div class="callout callout-style-default callout-tip callout-titled">

Describing physical change
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p><strong>Become</strong> is often used with a comparative e.g.&nbsp;‘<em>become bigger</em>’, or to describe a change: e.g.&nbsp;‘<em>the smolt <strong>becomes</strong> an adult salmon</em>’.</p>
<p><strong>Change</strong> has a broader meaning and can be used to introduce the idea: e.g.&nbsp;‘<em>the fish then <strong>changes</strong> again and <strong>becomes</strong> …</em>’, or ‘<em>the fish then <strong>changes</strong> again, <strong>growing</strong> bigger …</em>’ It can also be used with ‘into’ e.g.&nbsp;‘the fry <strong>changes into</strong> a smolt’ NB not <del>changes to</del> a smolt.</p>
<p><strong>Develop</strong> and <strong>grow</strong> can be used with a specific feature: e.g.&nbsp;‘<em>the egg hatches and the young fish <strong>develops / grows</strong> fins and a tail</em>’. Or to describe a change: e.g.&nbsp;‘<em>the smolt <strong>develops into / grows into</strong> an adult salmon</em>.’</p>
<p><strong>Turn into</strong> is a phrasal verb and is similar in meaning to ‘change into’ or ‘become’ e.g.&nbsp;‘<em>the fry <strong>turn into</strong> a smolt</em>’</p>

<p>We can’t use the verb <strong>evolve</strong> to describe this type of natural change.</p>
<p>Similarly, be careful with the verb <strong>transform</strong>, which suggests a change into something completely new. For example, <em>a ceterpillar <strong>transforms into</strong> a butterfly</em> or <em>Following the renovation, the old shed was <strong>transformed into</strong> a modern restaurant.</em></p>
<p>Make sure any adjectives or adverbs we use <strong>accurately</strong> describe what we are shown in the images. Can you see any problems in the following extracts?</p>
<p><em>The fish grow enormously in size during the final stage.</em></p>
<p><em>The huge salmon returns …</em></p>
<p><em>The fry migrate downstream to a highly turbulent water</em></p>
<p><em>At the end of this period, it turns into gigantic ‘adult salmon’</em></p>
<p><em>The fully developed salmon now have unique color patterns on their back…</em></p>

<p>In sentence 5, we do not know if these patterns are ‘unique’ (other fish may have them and the diagram does not tell us this information) ‘characteristic’ or ‘distinctive’ are good words to use here:</p>

<p>In process tasks we are more likely to be using small numbers. The general convention when writing numbers is to use the word form for the numbers one to ten and the numerals for numbers above ten. However, this is not a very important point to remember for the test.</p>
<p>Our writing task gives the following information about the size of the salmon in different stages of its like:</p>
<p><img src="https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/how-to-write-ielts-writing-task1-9/Pasted image 20250825160828.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>This give us a minimum and maximum length measured in centimeters. We can use the abbreviation ‘cm’ as shown in the image, but using the full word gives a better impression of our writing ability. There are two possible spellings: centimetres and centimeters. Try to be consistent in our spelling. We should often check for a mixture of cm, centimeters, centimetres.</p>
<p>There are several ways to describe the range of sizes above. Look at the following examples (notice the words in blue)</p>
<ul>
<li>The fry <font color="#245bdb">is between</font> three <font color="#245bdb">and</font> eight centimeters <font color="#245bdb">long</font>.</li>
<li>*The fry <font color="#245bdb">grows to between</font> three <font color="#245bdb">and</font> eight centimeters.</li>
<li>The fry <font color="#245bdb">can grow to between</font> three <font color="#245bdb">and</font> eight centimeters <font color="#245bdb">in length</font>.</li>
<li>The fry <font color="#245bdb">can reach up to</font> eight centimeters <font color="#245bdb">in length</font>.</li>
</ul>
<p>* We can also say: The fry <font color="#245bdb">grows to between</font> three <font color="#245bdb">and</font> eight centimeters <font color="#245bdb">in length</font>.</p>
<p>Can you correct the errors in the following sentences? Think about the type of relative clause you need to use to add extra information.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The salmon eggs take approximately 5-6 months to break out of their eggs and develop into baby <font color="#ff0000">salmons</font> called ‘fry’, <font color="#ff0000">with only 3-8 cm in length</font>. which are …</li>
<li>The little salmon can grow to more than three centimeters, less than eight in length. -&gt; grow to between 3 and 8 centimeters in length.</li>
<li>Fry evolve into smolt that is 12-15 centimeters. -&gt; Fry develop into smolt that is 12-15 centimeters in length.</li>
</ol>
<p>Suggested corections:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The salmon eggs take approximately 5-6 months to break out of their eggs and develop into baby salmon called ‘fry’, which are only 3-8 cm in length. (NB I used a non-defining relative clause to add the extra information about the length of the fry.)</li>
<li>The little salmon can grow to between three and eight centimeters in length.</li>
<li>Fry develop into / change into / turn into smolt, which are 12-15 centimeters in length / long. (Again, I need to use a non-defining relative clause here - notice the comma before which)</li>

<p>The first sentence in any paragraph should tell your reader the main topic of the paragraph. The sentences that follow should then expand on the first sentence, adding more information. When this doesn’t happen the result is confusing to the reader and will lower our Coherence and cohesion score. To demonstrate this, look at the following first sentence and think about the questions below:</p>
<p><font color="#ff0000">Firstly, in the upper river, the water moves slowly.</font></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What does the word ‘Firstly’, tell us? -&gt; that is first step in process,</li>
<li>As a reader, what do you expect to follow on from this? -&gt; other steps of river</li>
<li>What information in this sentence do you expect to learn more about?</li>
</ol>
<p>The word ‘Firstly,’ tells us that this is the first step in the process, and as this is the first sentence in the paragraph, logically, when we read this sentence, we expect to learn more about the water or different parts of the river, like this:</p>
<p><font color="#245bdb">Firstly, in the upper river, the water moves slowly. Then, as the water moves down the river, it flows faster.</font></p>
<p>But this candidate wrote:</p>
<p><font color="#c00000">Firstly, in the upper river, the water moves slowly. Salmon eggs are left below reeds and small stones before becoming young salmon called fry.</font></p>
<p>The information about the water in the upper river in the first sentence <strong>is</strong> important, but it is not the main idea or topic of the paragraph, and it is not the first step in the process. This is extra information about where the first step takes place (<em>the salmon eggs are left below reeds</em>). A relative clause will help here.</p>
<p><font color="#245bdb">Firstly, salmon eggs are left below reeds and small stones in the upper river, where the water moves slowly.</font></p>
<p>In the extract in red above, the second step in the process is reduced to ‘<em>before becoming young salmon called fry</em>’. This is too much information to add to our new sentence, so we need to find a way to refer back to the salmon eggs (which is where the young salmon come from):</p>
<p><font color="#245bdb">Firstly, salmon eggs are left below reeds and small stones in the upper river, where the water moves slowly. These eggs then become young salmon and are called ‘fry’.</font></p>
<p>Think about the information in our sentences following this pattern:</p>
<p><img src="https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/how-to-write-ielts-writing-task1-9/Pasted image 20250825163120.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>In the above image, we can see that the new information at the end of one sentence becomes the subject or the main idea at the beginning of the next sentence, working in a zig-zag pattern. We can add more information in between these sentences, but the change in focus should be made clear to the reader and we should be able to trace it clearly through our writing.</p>

<p>There are four stages in the life cycle of the Monarch butterfly.</p>
<p>In the first stage, eggs are laid on a plant.</p>
<p>After about four days, the eggs hatch into baby caterpillars, which are known as larvae.</p>
<p>The larvae eat almost continually at this stage, growing in size.</p>
<p>After two weeks, it is fully grown and can now begin a process called metamorphosis.</p>
<p>During metamorphosis, the larvae will form a chrysalis, which is a hard protective coating.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The salmon is a very common type of fish. The question introduces it to us as ‘<em>a species of large fish called the salmon</em>’ to help lower candidates understand the word. We don’t need to introduce it like this in our answer - we would only need to do this with a lesser-known species.</p></li>
<li><p>As the diagram shows, salmon live in both the river and the sea.</p></li>
<li><p>Look at the other details I noticed in the diagram before writing my answer. <img src="https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/how-to-write-ielts-writing-task1-9/Pasted image 20250825165729.png" class="img-fluid"></p></li>
<li><p>There are several details we need to pay attention to in a diagram like this:</p></li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li><font color="#245bdb">The arrows</font> - these can be used with different meanings, e.g.&nbsp;to show movement or to show a change. Here they are showing movement between different habitat.</li>
<li><font color="#245bdb">The key</font> (the extra information in the box) - this tells is the sizes and names of the fish in each stage. Notice that inverted commas have been used for the names. This shows that a word or phrase is being used in an unusual or technically way that may not be commonly known, which can affect how we use these terms in our writing.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The instruction to make comparisons ‘<font color="#245bdb">where relevant</font>’ applies more in process tasks than any other type of task 1 question. We may need to remind ourselves at stage 2 of our planning (when identify key ideas) to see if there is anything we can compare. In this task, we can compare the different environments (<font color="#245bdb">faster / slower</font>) and the fish (<font color="#245bdb">bigger / longer</font> etc). We might also compare its physical appearance (<font color="#245bdb">lighter / darker coloring</font>) or the lengths of time (the first stage is <font color="#245bdb">the shortest</font>). However, this instruction may not always be <font color="#245bdb">relevant</font> in a process task.</li>

<p>The diagram shows the different stages in the life cycle of a salmon. Overall, the cycle takes almost ten years and comprises three main stages, each of which takes place in a different aquatic environment.</p>
<p>The salmon begins life as an egg. In the slow-moving waters of the upper river, sheltered by reeds and small stones. Over a period of five to six months, the eggs hatch into very small fish known as ‘fry’, which can grow up to eight centimeters in length. The fry then move to the faster flowing water of the lower river, where they remain for a period of four years and continue to grow. During this phase, they can double or triple in size, reaching 12 to 15 centimeters, and are now referred to as ‘smolt’.</p>
<p>At the end of this stage, the smolt leave the river for the open sea, where they will spend the next five years of their life. It is in this salt-water environment that the fish develops its characteristic shape and coloring and reaches its full length of 70 to 76 centimeters, almost ten times its original size. Finally, the adult salmon will return to the slow-moving river to lay its eggs, and the cycle will begin again.</p>

<ul>
<li>I used inverted commas to introduce the new terms (‘fry’ and ‘smolt’) but only with the first mention of these terms.</li>
<li>Notice the way that I was able to use different tenses. I used: the simple present, modals (<em>can grow, can double</em>), the passive (<em>are referred to</em>), and future tenses (<em>will spend, will return, will begin</em>). I also varied between the plural (<em>the fry move, the smolt leave</em>) and singular (<em>the fish develops</em>). However, these variations are grouped together logically (i.e.&nbsp;I did not change backwards and forwards between the different tense or between singular and plural).</li>
<li>In terms of organization, I decided to write about stages one and two in the first paragraph, and then stages three and one (return to the beginning) in the second paragraph.</li>
<li>My answer is 208 words. There is no ideal length and each task will be different. However, you should aim to write between 160 and 220 words. I have never seen an answer with 150 words that was complete, so I don’t advise you to aim for this length. In the next exercise, you will practise working on a shorter answer</li>

<p>Process task’s answer can be little too short (below 150 words). Every test question is tested to make sure that there is enough to write about. When practising, be sure to only use authentic materials or those written by experienced test writers (look for the authors mentioned ..)</p>
<p>If we find that our answers are sometimes too short, look back at the diagram and think about the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are there any key features you have missed?</li>
<li>Are there any key features you have not highlighted enough?</li>
<li>Have you made any comparisons?</li>
</ul>
<p>Also think about the verbs we have used to describe a change - have we been too concise? (For example, although it is accurate to say that ‘<em>The fry become smolt</em>’), this could be developed and expanded to give more information about what is happening at this stage.</p>
<p>Short answers</p>
<p>The diagrams show the process through which a kind of fish called the salmon grows into an adult. The lifecycle of the salmon has 3 main stages and takes place in 3 different locations.</p>
<p>The cycle begins when salmon eggs are laid among the reeds and the small stones of the upper river. After around 5 to 6 months, these eggs turn into fry, which are 3-8 cm in length and begin to move to lower river where water flow is fast.</p>
<p>Fry live there for 4 years and become smolt, measuring 12-15 cm in length, after which they migrate to open sea. They live this new environment for approximately 5 years to become adult salmon (70-76 cm). The adult salmon then begins its journey back to slow-moving upper river where it lays eggs and the process starts over again.</p>

<p>Look at my notes below and compare them to yours before making the changes</p>
<p>in the next task.</p>
<p>NB in the final paragraph, the writer is saying that the salmon ‘’live there to become adult salmon’’ something is missing here as ‘to become’ is being given as a reason why they live in the sea. Instead, we need to know what changes occur when they live in the sea.</p>

<p>The diagrams show the process through which a kind of fish called the salmon grows into an adult. The lifecycle of the salmon lasts almost ten years and has three main stages, each taking place in a different location.</p>
<p>The cycle begins when salmon eggs are laid among the reeds and the small stones of the upper river. After around five to six months in the slower-moving waters, these eggs turn into fry, which are 3-8 cm in length and begin to move to the lower river, where the water flow is faster.</p>
<p>The fry live there for four years growing bigger and changing into what are called smolt, measuring 12-15 cm in length, after which they migrate to the open sea. They live in this new environment for approximately five years developing into adult salmon and reaching their full size (70-76 cm). The adult salmon then begins its journey back to the slow-moving upper river, where it lays eggs and the process starts over again.</p>

<li>The overview is now more complete and includes information about the total time taken as well as the different environments.</li>
<li>Although I changed the smaller numbers to words, I decide to leave the shortest measurements as numerals so that all of the measurements are consistent.</li>

<p>Look back at any process task answers you have written in the past and consider your overview statement. Did you include features such as:</p>
<p>how many stages there are in the process overall length of time where the stages take place?</p>
<p>Look at the length of your answers - do they tend to be short? (under or very close to 150 words)? Look back at the diagrams and check the following: Did you use an authentic task (from Cambridge books 9 - 16)? If not, there may not be enough to write about, which is why your answer is too short. Were you too brief in some parts of the summary? Which parts could you expand more?</p>
<p>Remember to think about the following:</p>
<p>Are there any key features you have missed?</p>
<p>Are there any key features you have not have highlighted enough? Have you made any comparisons?</p>
<p>Coherence</p>
<p>and cohesion</p>
<p>Check the coherence and cohesion of your process task answers. Reading the answers aloud can help. Do you vary the beginning of your sentences, or do they always / mainly begin like this:</p>
<p>First, …Then, …. Next, …. After this, …..Following this, ……</p>
<p>Finally,…..</p>
<p>Can you trace the ideas in your summary using the zig-zag pattern we saw in the Monarch butterfly summary? What changes can you make now to improve the coherence and cohesion?</p>
<p>Language Did you manage to vary the tenses in your answer? What changes could you make? Is there any new language you would like to make a note of to use in the future?</p>

<hr>
<p>The plans illustrate how a university sports center is set to be transformed after redevelopment. Overall, the sports center will become more convenient and indoor-oriented, with no outdoor activities and more communal space.</p>
<p>At present, the sports center consists of a relatively small building and two outdoor courts on each side. The building houses a 25-meter pool, and its facilities include a changing room and a seating area, and there is a gym on the rear and a reception area to the front.</p>
<p>Following the renovations, only the central pool and its facilities remain the same. The building will be expanded to the west and east, removing outdoor courts and making way for more indoor facilities. These include a leisure pool on the western side, which is slightly larger than the central pool, and will have its own changing room, and on the western side, a new sports hall, and two dance studios. The current gym will be lengthened so that it is double its current size. The reception area will also be widened, making it more spacious. On arrival, the visitors to the new center will benefit from a third changing room, a sports shop, and a cafe, all located around the reception area.</p>

<p><strong>Q36 — evidence (you wrote “evident”)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Why:</strong> After “no ___ that…”, English requires a <strong>noun</strong>, not an adjective.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Collocation:</strong> “no <strong>evidence</strong> that …” is the natural pair.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mini rule:</strong> If you hear “no / some / much / little ___ that…”, expect a <strong>noun</strong> (<em>evidence, proof, indication</em>).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Word-form pairs to remember:</strong> evidence (n) vs.&nbsp;evident (adj); confidence vs.&nbsp;confident; intelligence vs.&nbsp;intelligent.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q37 — destinations (you wrote “destination”)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Why:</strong> The script says “Little was known about the <strong>actual destinations</strong> of particular species and <strong>how they travelled there</strong>.” Also the note line reads “about the <strong>___ and journeys</strong>”, which signals <strong>parallel plurals</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mini rule:</strong> When a blank is coordinated with another <strong>plural</strong> (“X <strong>and</strong> journeys”), make <strong>both plural</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q38 — oceans (you wrote “ocean”)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Why:</strong> The lecture uses the collocation “over <strong>vast oceans</strong>.” IELTS often tests the faint <strong>-s</strong> at word ends.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mini rule:</strong> Quantifiers like <strong>vast</strong>, <strong>huge stretches of</strong>, and references to large areas often take the <strong>plural</strong> (<em>oceans, mountains, forests</em>). Listen for the final /z/ sound.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q40 — atlas (you wrote “atlat”)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Why:</strong> Simple letter transposition under time pressure. The line was “In 1931, <strong>an atlas</strong> was published…”.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mini rule:</strong> Use the <strong>article cue</strong>: “<strong>an</strong> atlas” → vowel sound → <em>atlas</em>. When you hear an article + noun, lock in the standard spelling you know.</p></li>
</ul>

<li><p>Little was known about birds’ actual <strong>____</strong> and journeys. → <strong>destinations</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Small birds weighing only a few grams could still fly over vast <strong>____</strong>. → <strong>oceans</strong></p></li>
<li><p>In 1931, <strong>an ____</strong> of European bird migration was published. → <strong>atlas</strong></p></li>

<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Grammar slot check (Word form):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After <em>no / little / much + </em>__ + that…_ → <strong>noun</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Parallelism scan (Number):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If the other half is plural (“X <strong>and</strong> journeys”), make your blank plural too.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>End-sound focus (Plural -s):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Train your ear for the soft <strong>/z/</strong> at the end (oceans, destinations). Shadow-read transcripts to feel the endings.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Article cue for spelling:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>“<strong>a/an + noun</strong>” often signals a common, dictionary form you already know. Use the article to sanity-check spelling (an <strong>atlas</strong>).</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Tip: after verbs like <strong>keep/maintain/update</strong>, IELTS often expects a plural noun when tracking multiple items (e.g., <em>keep</em> <strong><em>records</em></strong> <em>of books</em>, <em>keep</em> <strong><em>lists</em></strong> <em>of names</em>).</p></li>

<p><strong>Q34 – SMARTPHONES</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Your answer:</strong> SMARTPHONE (singular)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Correct answer:</strong> SMARTPHONES (plural)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reason:</strong> The passage says:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Think about smartphones. They didn’t even exist until comparatively recently, but today young people use them all the time…”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The plural form is required because the speaker refers to the widespread use of many devices, not just one.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Q36 – PLAYGROUND</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Your answer:</strong> CONVERSATION</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Correct answer:</strong> PLAYGROUND</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reason:</strong> The passage says:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“teachers have found that playground conversations in Icelandic secondary schools can be conducted entirely in English…”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The notes require the <strong>location</strong> where discussions occur, not the activity itself. So “playground” (location) is correct rather than “conversation” (activity).</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p>The key is to match what the notes are asking for—<strong>context/location vs.&nbsp;action</strong> and <strong>plural vs.&nbsp;singular</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tip: after verbs like <strong>keep/maintain/update</strong>, IELTS often expects a plural noun when tracking multiple items (e.g., <em>keep</em> <strong><em>records</em></strong> <em>of books</em>, <em>keep</em> <strong><em>lists</em></strong> <em>of names</em>).</li>

<li><em>Well, I’m currently studying computer science at university. I find the curriculum quite challenging, but I enjoy acquiring new knowledge and developing my skills. Sometimes it’s difficult to grasp some concepts, but I try to focus and catch up with extra readings.</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Do you enjoy learning new things?</p>

</ul></li>
<li><p>Do you think technology has changed the way people learn?</p>

<p><em>Last summer, I visited a historical city in Europe. The city was very multicultural, with tourists from different countries. I spent most of my time exploring the old streets and museums, which were fascinating.</em></p>
<p><em>One day, I walked along a river and discovered a small garden with traditional architecture. I also learned about local customs and crafts, which I found quite impressive. The whole experience felt calming, almost meditative, because I could just immerse myself in the environment.

<li><p>How can education help people in modern society?</p>

<li><p>Do you think technology is beneficial for work and learning?</p>

<p><strong>Topic: Education &amp; Learning</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Can you tell me about your current studies or work?</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I’m currently pursuing a Master’s in Computer Science. The coursework is intensive, but I find it intellectually stimulating. It challenges me to think critically and apply theory in practical scenarios, which I really enjoy. Occasionally, I struggle with some advanced concepts, but supplementary readings and online tutorials help me keep pace.</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Do you enjoy learning new things?</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Absolutely. I think continuous learning is essential, not only academically but also personally. I enjoy exploring subjects that expand my perspective, though sometimes it can feel a bit overwhelming when deadlines pile up.</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Topic: Technology / Digital Life</strong></p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>How often do you use digital devices like smartphones or laptops?</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I use them daily, sometimes almost constantly. Smartphones are incredibly versatile—they allow me to access news, watch educational videos, and connect with colleagues or friends. Laptops, of course, are essential for research and assignments.</em></li>

<li><p>Do you think technology has changed the way people learn?</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Yes, profoundly. Digital platforms make learning far more accessible and interactive. Students can engage with multimedia content and online courses at their own pace.

<p><em>I recently watched a production of Romeo and Juliet at The Emporium Theatre. I had read the play before, but watching it live was very different.

The costumes were modern, which I didn’t expect, but I think it worked. I liked the music at the start, but later it didn’t have much effect. One thing I didn’t like was that some actors spoke too fast or quietly, so I couldn’t always understand them.

<p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>
<p><em>Recently, I watched a production of Romeo and Juliet at The Emporium Theatre. I had read the play before, but seeing it performed live was a completely different experience. The set design was visually stunning and probably the most memorable aspect of the performance. The lighting created the right atmosphere for different scenes, though some moments were a bit dim and hard to follow. The costumes were contemporary, which surprised me initially, but ultimately I thought it worked well and added a fresh perspective. The music at the start was brilliant, though it didn’t have much impact later in Acts 2 and 3, which was a little disappointing. One aspect that I think could have been improved was the actors’ delivery of lines. Some spoke too quickly, while others weren’t loud enough, which made it difficult to catch every word. Overall, the performance had a powerful emotional effect on me, particularly the ending, which intensified the drama. I found it a very engaging and thought-provoking experience, and it reminded me why Shakespeare’s works remain so relevant today.</em></p>

<p><strong>Topic: Theatre, Culture, and Literature</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Why do you think classic plays like <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> are still performed today?</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I think it’s because the themes are universal and timeless. Issues such as family tension, love, and conflict are still very relatable. Even though society has changed a lot since Shakespeare’s time, these basic human experiences remain relevant.</em></li>

<li><p>How important is the role of the director in a theatre production?</p>

</ul></li>
<li><p>What makes a performance memorable for the audience?</p>
<ul>
<li><em>A combination of factors: compelling acting, imaginative set and costume design, and an emotional connection. If the audience can relate to the characters or feel the tension and drama, it leaves a lasting impression.</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Do you think watching plays in translation affects your understanding?</p>
<ul>
<li><em>It can initially be challenging, but expressions, gestures, and acting often convey the meaning effectively. I found that focusing on non-verbal cues helped me appreciate the performance even if I didn’t understand every word.</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Why are Shakespeare’s plays so popular internationally?</p>
<ul>
<li><em>They’re versatile and can be interpreted in many ways. Directors can experiment with different settings, costumes, or time periods while keeping the story’s essence intact. Also, the characters are complex, which allows audiences across cultures to connect with them.</em></li>

  <title>Languages die out</title>
  <dc:creator>Hung </dc:creator>
  <link>https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/w2-language/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Every year, several languages die out. Some people think that this is not important because life will be easier if there are fewer languages in the world.</p>
<p>To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?</p>
<p>It is helpful to turn the statement in the task into a question. In this case, we could see this as two separate questions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Is it important that languages are dying out every year?</li>
<li>Does having fewer languages make it easier?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>To answer these question, we will need to discuss the impact that the loss of languages has. Clearly, it will affect the people whose language is dying out. However, the opinion in the question is about the impact this has on the world in general : <em>‘life will be easier (for everyone) if there are fewer languages in the world’</em>. Therefore, the focus in this question is on both one specific group (the people losing their language) and the world at large (everyone else).</p></li>
<li><p>The ideas we have for this task are more likely to be based on abstract themes. Concrete themes, such as <em>money, food, or socializing</em> are often easier to write or talk about. More abstract ideas, such as ‘life’, ‘society’, and ‘culture’ are more difficult to discuss, which adds another level of difficulty to this task. If we have an abstract topic, visualization techniques can help us to see more concrete ideas within the topic that then will help us to write about it.</p></li>
<li><p>The question tells us that, ‘Some people think that (the loss of language) is not important’. In other words, we are being told about an attitude or reaction to something, and we will need to discuss this attitude in our essay. We are also told these people think that ‘life will be easier’ without these language, so they are also commenting on the effect or impact that this will have. Thus, again, we need to consider cause and effect in this essay.</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="planner" class="level1" data-number="1">
<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Planner</h1>
<p>Introduction General topic Disappearing language</p>
<p>Focus: people in remote areas + people in general</p>
<p>Issue to discuss: is it important that languages are dying out? Does it make life easier?</p>
<p>My initial position: I completely disagree - yes, it is important</p>
<p>Themes: Language, culture, changing world, people, communication</p>
<p>Side A: Life is easier / the loss is unimportant</p>
<p>Main topic of this paragraph: How life is made easier (benefits of loss)</p>
<p>1 Language - use it every day - business communication and travel -&gt; transactions easier if people understand each other + problems can be solved faster</p>
<p>2 culture - can understand the culture -&gt; x</p>
<p>3 Changing world =</p>
<p>changes to language are inevitable (more travel, more international business -&gt; need to communicate more)</p>
<p>4 people - easier for business people and travellers</p>
<p>What did i show or prove? link to the question? Easier for certain people / situations - loss is inevitable</p>
<p>Side B: The loss is important</p>
<p>Main topic of this paragraph</p>
<p>The negative effects of this loss</p>
<p>1 Language - Yes, business is easier, BUT language is used for more than this e.g.&nbsp;express feelings + culture + history</p>
<p>2 Culture - language used to express culture (poems, literature, history = adds variety / makes the world richer)</p>
<p>= part of identity of individuals and community</p>
<p>3 People - -&gt; for the people involved this is a big loss + for the world, this is a big loss</p>
<p>What prove</p>
<p>Some people are far more affected by the loss than others</p>
<p>Conclusion - Summary of my main points:</p>
<p>Yes, it makes business easier but language adds variety and makes the world richer.</p>
<p>Question to answer: To what extent do you agree / disagree?</p>
<p>My final position: I completely disagree</p>
<p>In some parts of the world, native languages are being lost as societies develop and evolve. Some believe that this is unimportant and even see it as an advantage. This essay will discuss whether the loss of such languages should be cause for concern.</p>
<p>It is true that many aspects of modern day life are made easier through sharing a common language. First and foremost, business transactions are much simpler when the two parties concerned can understand each other well. Travel problems can also be dealt with much faster when there is mutual understanding. Thanks to globalization, these types of communication are increasing, and this could be seen as largely responsible for the disappearance of languages in more remote areas. If people in those areas work in tourism, or international trade, they must adopt the more widely used languages of the world. Thus, with each new generation, their native tongue becomes both less useful and less used. Sadly, the desire to make life simpler makes the loss of some languages inevitable.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this inevitability does not mean the loss is insignificant. Language has a multitude of uses that go far beyond tourism and business communication. Our native tongue is used to express our deepest feelings and emotions, which are much more difficult to convey when using a second language. Language also plays an important part in our culture and identity, uniting us as a community. Thus, when a language is lost, part of the community and culture also disappears. This must be an enormous loss for the people concerned.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while it is true that having fewer languages benefits the world of business, and makes transactions easier, I completely disagree with the view that the continued loss of languages is unimportant. The variety of native languages and cultures is what makes the world a richer place, and any loss of this kind should not be dismissed lightly.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Some people think that people should read books from their own country, while others believe that reading international literature is more important. Discuss both views and give your opinion.</p>
<p>Plan</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>General topic: Reading and literature</p>
<p>Focus: Local vs international literature</p>
<p>Issue to discuss: Should people read national or international works?</p>
<p>Position: While local literature is important, international literature has broader benefits</p>
<p>Themes: culture, identity, personal development, education, global awareness</p>
<p>Side A: Local literature is important</p>
<p>Main topic of paragraph: Benefits of reading literature from your own country</p>
<p>1 culture &amp; identity - local stories reflect national history, traditions, values -&gt; helps develop sense of belonging</p>
<p>2 Language skills - written in familiar language -&gt; easier comprehension and engagement</p>
<p>3 Heritage &amp; Knowledge - understanding historical events, local society -&gt; educates younger generations</p>
<p>link back: shows why reading local literature is valuable and necessary</p>
<p>Side B international literature is important</p>
<p>main topic: benefits of reading literature from other countries</p>
<p>1 cultural awareness &amp; empathy - exposure to different ways of life, social issues, moral dilemmas</p>
<p>2 critical thinking &amp; creativity - compare different societies, challenge assumptions</p>
<p>3 global perspective helps navigate an interconnected world, broadens horizons</p>
<p>link back: shows why international literature is increasingly important.</p>
<p>conclusion</p>
<p>summary of main points: local literature promotes identity; international literature promotes understanding and critical thinking</p>
<p>final position: balance is best - engage with both, but international exposure is essential for broader personal growth</p>
<p>In many countries, there is an ongoing debate about whether people should focus on reading books from their own nation or whether exploring international literature is more beneficial. While literature from one’s own country certainly has value, I believe that reading works from around the world provides wider benefits for personal development and understanding.</p>
<p>It is true that local literature plays an important role in preserving culture and identity. Stories written by authors from one’s own country often reflect national history, traditions, and social values. By reading these works, individuals gain a deeper understanding of their heritage, which can strengthen a sense of belonging and connection to their community. Moreover, local literature is usually written in a familiar language, which makes it easier for readers to engage with the content and appreciate the subtleties of style and expression. For younger generations, these books provide knowledge of historical events and societal norms, ensuring that important cultural lessons are not forgotten.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, reading international literature offers benefits that local works alone cannot provide. Exposure to stories from different countries allows readers to develop empathy and a broader understanding of diverse cultures. International literature can present social issues, moral dilemmas, and everyday experiences that are entirely different from one’s own, encouraging critical thinking and reflection. Additionally, such reading fosters creativity, as comparing different societies and styles challenges assumptions and expands the imagination. In today’s increasingly interconnected world, having a global perspective is essential, and international literature is an effective way to achieve this.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while books from one’s own country are valuable for preserving identity and cultural knowledge, reading international works offers a broader understanding of humanity and encourages personal growth. Therefore, I would argue that a balanced approach is ideal: people should read both local and global literature, but international exposure should play a central role in fostering a well-rounded worldview.</p>

  <title>Learning second language of children</title>
  <dc:creator>Hung </dc:creator>
  <link>https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/w2-children-second-language/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Some people think that children should learn a second language at primary school. Others believe it is better to wait until secondary school. Discuss both views and give your opinion.</p>
<p>introduction</p>
<p>In many parts of the world, when children begin to learn a second language has become a topic of debate. This essay will discuss both sides of the argument and explain why I completely agree that starting at primary school is more beneficial.</p>
<p>It is true that <del>children who are learning language earlier</del> children who start learning a second language early are more receptive to new sounds and structures than those who start later. First and foremost, at primary school age, children’s brains are more flexible, allowing them to <del>pick up pronunciation and grammar more naturally</del> acquire correct pronunciation and grammatical structures with greater ease. As a result, they often develop a stronger accent and better overall fluency than those who start later. Furthermore, learning a language does not need a highly abstract <del>thinking</del> cognitive <del>skill like math, physics, …</del> subjects like mathematics and physics, which are normally developed in more mature students. <del>So, letting them invest in a second language when in primary school is a better investment than other fields.</del> -&gt; Therefore/ Hence, it is more effective to focus on second language acquisition at primary school than on other fields.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, some argue that children should begin learning a second language at secondary school or later, rather than at primary school. They suggest that older students have more developed cognitive abilities, allowing them to grasp complex grammar rules and language structures more quickly than younger learners. As a result, <del>they can learn language more effectively in a shorter time than younger age</del> they may achieve noticeable progress in a shorter period. In addition, adolescents may be more motivated because they can appreciate its relevance to future education and career opportunities / they can understand the relevance of language learning for their future education and career prospects. <del>Because of that, they can have a choice of themself about which language they should learn and be more independent in the road of learning.</del> They also have more autonomy in choosing which language to study and can take greater responsibility for their learning. While these points have some merit, I believe the advantages of starting early outweigh the benefits of a later start.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while some argue that older children may learn a second language more quickly due to their cognitive maturity and motivation, I firmly believe that starting at primary school is more beneficial. Early exposure provides a longer period for practice, enhances pronunciation and grammar acquisition, and supports overall cognitive development. Consequently, beginning language learning at a young age offers advantages that outweigh those of a later start.</p>

<section id="can-you-tell-me-about-your-hometown" class="level2" data-number="1.1">
<h2 data-number="1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="can-you-tell-me-about-your-hometown"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Can you tell me about your hometown?</h2>
<p>My hometown is Nha Trang, a coastal city in central Vietnam. It’s famous for its beautiful beaches, fresh seafood, and relaxed lifestyle. What I like most is the ocean view, because it makes the city feel peaceful even when it’s busy.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-do-you-like-most-about-your-hometown" class="level2" data-number="1.2">
<h2 data-number="1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-do-you-like-most-about-your-hometown"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> What do you like most about your hometown?</h2>
<p>What I like most about Nha Trang is the beach. It’s only a few minutes away from most parts of the city, so people can swim or walk along the shore almost every day. For me the sea breeze and the sound of the waves make life there very relaxing.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-has-your-hometown-changed-in-recent-years" class="level2" data-number="1.3">
<h2 data-number="1.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-has-your-hometown-changed-in-recent-years"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> How has your hometown changed in recent years?</h2>
<p>In recent years, Nha Trang has developed a lot, especially with tourism. There are many new hotels, resorts, and shopping centers, which make the city look more modern. However, sometimes I feel it has become more crowded and noisy compared to before.</p>
</section>
<section id="is-your-hometown-a-good-place-for-young-people" class="level2" data-number="1.4">
<h2 data-number="1.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="is-your-hometown-a-good-place-for-young-people"><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Is your hometown a good place for young people?</h2>
<p>Yes, I think Nha Trang is a good place for young people. There are many outdoor activities like swimming, diving, or just hanging out by the beach, which are fun and healthy. At the same time, the city is growing, so there are more cafes and entertainment spots where young people can spend time together.</p>

<section id="would-you-like-to-live-in-your-hometown-in-the-future" class="level2" data-number="1.5">

<p>I would like to return to Nha Trang in the future, but maybe not permanently. It’s a beautiful place to relax and enjoy the beach, but I think bigger cities offer more career opportunities. So I imagine myself working elsewhere and coming back to Nha Trang for holiday.</p>

<p>On weekdays I usually wake up around 6:30 in the morning. I like starting my day early because it gives me more time to prepare for studying. Waking up early also makes me feel more productive and focused.</p>

<p>I’m really into documentaries, especially ones about successfully entrepreneurs. There’s a great one about Steve Jobs that I found really inspiring. It talks about his journey building Apple, his innovation ideas, and how he overcame challenges. It made me realize the importance of perseverance and believing in your vision.</p>
<p>Oh!, I’m absolutely fascinated by documentaries, especially those about visionary entrepreneurs. The one on Steve Jobs was truly captivating. It really delved into his relentless drive, his groundbreaking ideas, and how he powered through setbacks. It left me feeling so inspired. Like anything is possible if you’re passionate enough.</p>

<p>I usually watch movies at home with my girlfriend. We love having movie nights where we can relax on the couch, enjoy some snacks, and just unwind after a long day. It’s also great because we have a lot more control over what we watch and can pause whenever we want for bathroom breaks or to grab more popcorn.</p>

<p>I usually watch movies with my girlfriend. We both enjoy going to the cinema when a new horror film is released, but most of the time we watch movies at home because it feels more comfortable and relaxing. It’s a nice way for us to spend time together and share our opinions about the story afterwards.</p>

<p>The last movie I watched was Dune. I really enjoyed it because the visuals were stunning and the atmosphere felt very unique. I also liked how the story mixed science fiction with political themes, which made it more thought-provoking than an ordinary action film.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-often-do-you-watch-movies" class="level2" data-number="3.5">
<h2 data-number="3.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-often-do-you-watch-movies"><span class="header-section-number">3.5</span> How often do you watch movies?</h2>
<p>I usually watch movies about once or twice a week. It depends on how busy I am with my studies, but I try to make time because it helps me relax. Watching a good film is like a short break that keeps me refreshed.</p>

<h2 data-number="4.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-you-should-learn-from-this-recording"><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> <strong>📘 What you should learn from this recording</strong></h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Be careful with corrections &amp; false starts</strong></p>
<p>– IELTS speakers often say one thing, then correct or add new info. Always wait.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Watch for distractors</strong></p>
<p>– They throw in multiple items (red shirts vs blue shirts, snack vs drink, 190 vs 199).</p>
<p>– You must match exactly to the question.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Numbers are dangerous</strong></p>
<p>– They like to mention a number, then another number → only the final one is correct.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Exact wording matters</strong></p>
<p>– “Reference” ≠ “certificate.” “Story” ≠ “game.” Always take the first correct match.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>IELTS loves practical detail</strong></p>
<p>– Equipment, clothing, times, costs → everyday details are often tested.</p></li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>👉 So, even though you got all correct, the <em>lesson</em> here is:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Don’t answer too quickly.</p></li>
<li><p>Wait to see if the speaker <strong>changes, corrects, or contrasts</strong> the detail.</p></li>
<li><p>When two possible answers appear, IELTS usually wants the <strong>first one mentioned that matches the question</strong>.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Your answer:</strong> A (the increasing risk of accidents)</p></li>

<blockquote class="blockquote">

<h3 data-number="5.0.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-completed-training-course-experience"><span class="header-section-number">5.0.4</span> <strong>Why</strong>&nbsp; <strong>“completed training course” ≠ experience</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Experience</strong> = practical work done in real jobs (on-site, real tasks).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Training course</strong> = education, not real-world job experience.</p></li>
<li><p>The clue is in <strong>contrast</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“A year’s experience would be preferred” (real work)</p></li>
<li><p>“but… might consider training course” (no experience, only training).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>So IELTS wants you to hear that <strong>experience is not essential</strong>.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>The word <strong>“completed”</strong> misleads. It <em>feels like</em> you “did” something, which is close to work.</p></li>
<li><p>But in IELTS logic: completing a course = <strong>qualification</strong>, not <strong>experience</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 data-number="5.0.6" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ielts-trick-here"><span class="header-section-number">5.0.6</span> <strong>IELTS trick here</strong></h3>
<p>They want to see if candidates can <strong>distinguish between “preferred but not essential” vs.&nbsp;“required”</strong>.</p>
<p>So the correct label = <strong>C (experience not essential)</strong>.</p>

</section>
<section id="q20-farm-worker" class="level3" data-number="5.0.7">
<h3 data-number="5.0.7" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="q20-farm-worker"><span class="header-section-number">5.0.7</span> <strong>❌ Q20 – Farm worker</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Your answer:</strong> B (involves leading a team)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Correct answer:</strong> G (accommodation available)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Transcript clue:</strong></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Perks of the job include the <strong>possibility of renting a small cottage on the estate</strong>, and the chance to earn a competitive salary.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Trap:</strong> Maybe rushed here and confused it with “manager roles” that involve leading a team (B). The key signal word: “cottage on the estate” → accommodation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I didn’t know the cottage words i a small house, so i missed it.</p>
<p>small cottage on the estate</p>
<hr>
<p>✅ <strong>Pattern in your mistakes:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>You sometimes <strong>default to common-sense answers</strong> (e.g.&nbsp;accidents, money, leadership) instead of anchoring to the transcript.</p></li>
<li><p>You may <strong>misplace answers</strong> — using a keyword from one job (farm worker) and applying it to another (tree technician).</p></li>
<li><p>You sometimes <strong>stop listening after the first clue</strong> (“competitive salary”) instead of listening for the whole detail.</p></li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>👉 Suggestion for next time:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Always <strong>underline the unique job detail</strong>: maternity cover = not permanent, cottage = accommodation.</p></li>
<li><p>For disadvantages/advantages, <strong>watch for contrasts</strong> (e.g.&nbsp;“health and safety are much higher now” kills option A).</p></li>
<li><p>Use <strong>process of elimination</strong> — ask yourself: “Did she actually say this, or am I assuming?” # Recording 3</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Adam: <em>“It was hard to keep track… I had so many people… had to make sure I kept a proper record”</em></p></li>
<li><p>The distractor = “simple to set up” (B) → ❌ BUT he said it was <em>hard</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Correct answers = <strong>C (large sample)</strong> + <strong>D (subjects unaware)</strong>.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>🔑 <strong>Tip</strong>: If speaker says <em>“hard / difficult”</em>, never choose “easy / simple”.</p>
<hr>

<li><p><strong>Trap (Q23–24)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Rosie: <em>“results problematic… seemed lower than package… probably I didn’t grind enough… scales not accurate enough.”</em></p></li>
<li><p>Distractor = “package info was incorrect” → ❌ She rejects that idea (“I reckon package info was right”).</p></li>
<li><p>Correct = <strong>C (not grind finely enough)</strong> + <strong>E (scales unsuitable)</strong>.</p></li>

</ul>
<p>🔑 <strong>Tip</strong>: Confusing ≠ inaccurate. IELTS loves this distinction.</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Trap (Q25)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Adam: <em>“Items at start/end of menu more likely to be chosen → put low-calorie items there → people will go for them.”</em></p></li>

<li><p>Distractors: “fewer options” (not said), “more low-calorie foods” (not said).</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>🔑 <strong>Tip</strong>: When they talk about <em>positioning / structure / arrangement</em>, the answer is about <strong>organisation</strong>, not quantity.</p>

<h2 data-number="5.9" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="exercise-health"><span class="header-section-number">5.9</span> <strong>🏃 Exercise &amp; Health</strong></h2>

<li><p>Rosie: <em>“40% men say they do… but actually only 6% do. 30% women say… only 4% do.”</em></p></li>

<li><p>Distractor = “women now exercise more” ❌ (not mentioned).</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>🔑 <strong>Tip</strong>: Look for contrast markers (<em>“say… but actually”</em>). The real answer is always after the contrast.</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Trap (Q29)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Adam: <em>“Not sure if we should include exercise… our tutor said focus on nutrition… that will be simpler.”</em></p></li>
<li><p>Correct = <strong>A (probably leave it out)</strong>.</p></li>

<li><p>“should discuss with tutor” ❌ (they didn’t mention asking tutor again).</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>🔑 <strong>Tip</strong>: When they conclude “that will be simpler,” it means <strong>decision is made</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>✅ So your main mistakes (Q26 earlier) happened because:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You mixed up <em>confusing</em> vs <em>inaccurate</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>You trusted the <strong>first idea mentioned</strong>, but IELTS hides the answer in the <strong>clarification or contrast</strong>. # Recording 4</p></li>

<section id="q33-people-are-buying-more-33-for-knitting-nowadays." class="level2" data-number="5.10">
<h2 data-number="5.10" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="q33-people-are-buying-more-33-for-knitting-nowadays."><span class="header-section-number">5.10</span> <strong>❌ Q33 – “People are buying more (33) ……… for knitting nowadays.”</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p>You wrote: <strong>equipments</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Correct answer: <strong>equipment</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>📌 Why?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In English, <strong>“equipment” is uncountable</strong> → ❌ no plural “equipments.”</p></li>
<li><p>The speaker said: <em>“…we’re also seeing an increase in the sales figures for knitting_ <strong><em>equipment</em></strong>_.”</em></p></li>
<li><p>IELTS listening tests your <strong>grammar awareness</strong>: even if you hear “equipmentS” in your head, you must know the correct word form.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>👉 <strong>Trap</strong>: They test if you know that some nouns don’t take “s” (e.g.&nbsp;furniture, information, advice, luggage, equipment).</p>
<p><strong>How to avoid next time:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you hear a word that could be uncountable, write it in singular form unless you are 100% sure plural is correct.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="q40-everyday-tasks-like-looking-after-40-were-done-while-knitting." class="level2" data-number="5.11">

<ul>
<li><p>You wrote: <strong>sheeps</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Correct answer: <strong>sheep</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>📌 Why?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“Sheep” is <strong>irregular plural</strong> → both singular &amp; plural form is the same.</p></li>
<li><p>The speaker said: <em>“…men, women and children took every opportunity to knit, for example, while watching over_ <strong><em>sheep</em></strong>_.”</em></p></li>
<li><p>IELTS loves to check if you know irregular plurals (sheep, deer, fish, species, etc.).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>👉 <strong>Trap</strong>: You heard the plural idea (many sheep), so you added <strong>s</strong> by instinct. But the rule is: <strong>no “s” for sheep</strong> in plural.</p>
<p><strong>How to avoid next time:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Revise <strong>irregular plurals</strong>: sheep, deer, fish, series, species, offspring, aircraft.</p></li>
<li><p>When in doubt, trust grammar rules — IELTS will never break them.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>✅ So both mistakes were not about <strong>listening</strong> but about <strong>word form &amp; grammar</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Q33 = uncountable noun rule.</p></li>
<li><p>Q40 = irregular plural rule.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="recording-1" class="level1" data-number="5">
<h1 data-number="5"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Recording 1</h1>
<p><strong>Question 7</strong>: “central heating and stove that burns …”</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>You wrote:</strong> <em>woods</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Correct answer:</strong> <em>wood</em></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>In the recording, Shirley says:</p>
<p><em>“We can provide all the wood you need for it. It smells so much nicer than coal…”</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Why not “woods”?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>“Wood” in English is <strong>uncountable</strong> when referring to the material used for burning.</p></li>
<li><p>“Woods” (plural) usually refers to a forest or a collection of trees, not the material for a fire.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Tip to know:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Listen for <strong>“all the wood”</strong> — singular/uncountable is correct here.</p></li>
<li><p>Key phrases: <em>“all the … you need”</em> or <em>“some …”</em> → usually uncountable nouns.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Other notes on your mistakes:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q3</strong>: You wrote <em>CHIRVIL</em>, correct spelling: <em>CHERVIL</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Shirley spells it: <em>“Chervil. C-H-E-R-V for Victor I-L.”</em></p></li>
<li><p>Listening tip: Pay attention to <strong>spelling clues</strong> in conversations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q5</strong>: You wrote <em>BACKYARD</em>, correct: <em>GARDEN</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Shirley says: <em>“Yes, you get to it from the living room through French doors…”</em></p></li>
<li><p>“Garden” is the standard word in the UK for what Americans might call a backyard.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tip:</strong> Note context: outdoor area directly attached to the house is often “garden” in UK English.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>You answered:</strong> I</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Recording clue:</strong></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“As we’ve now purchased additional space to the east of the recreation ground, beyond the trees, we plan to move it away from its current location, which is rather near the road, into this new area beyond the line of trees.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Why F?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The speaker specifies <strong>“beyond the line of trees”</strong> to the <strong>east</strong> of the recreation ground.</p></li>
<li><p>On the map, the letter F corresponds to this <strong>new eastern location beyond the trees</strong>, not I.</p></li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>You answered:</strong> D</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Correct answer:</strong> I</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recording clue:</strong></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The skateboard ramp is very popular … we decided to have it in the southeast corner near the road.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Why I?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>On the map, I corresponds to the <strong>southeast corner near the road</strong>, exactly as described.</p></li>
<li><p>D might have been <strong>near the river</strong>, which was considered but <strong>rejected</strong>.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Tip:</strong> Notice <strong>decisions vs.&nbsp;considerations</strong>. If the speaker mentions “we considered X but decided Y,” you must pick Y, the final location.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>✅ <strong>Summary of the error pattern:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>You chose either <strong>planned/considered location</strong> instead of <strong>final location</strong>, or misread <strong>directional cues</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Always mark <strong>final decisions</strong> and track <strong>positional words</strong>: near, beyond, east, southeast, etc.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Recording clue:</strong></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Amy: “In a way it’s strange that there was such a demand for bike-sharing because you’d have thought most people would have used their own bikes.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Why C?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Both speakers <strong>express surprise</strong> that Amsterdam’s scheme is so well used given the strong cycling culture.</p></li>
<li><p>“Well designed” is not mentioned; the key is <strong>unexpected success</strong>.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Tip:</strong> Focus on adjectives that show <strong>emotion or surprise</strong>.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Recording clue:</strong></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Jake: “Basically, not enough’s been spent on increasing the number of cycle lanes. Hopefully that’ll change.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Why D?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The problem is <strong>underinvestment</strong>, not rapid expansion.</p></li>
<li><p>“Expanded too quickly” is the opposite of what was said.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Tip:</strong> Look for words like <strong>not enough / insufficient / lacking</strong>, which often indicate the correct answer.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>You answered:</strong> D (more investment required)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Correct answer:</strong> E (system well designed)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recording clue:</strong></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Amy: “Mmm. They built a huge network of cycle lanes to support the introduction of the scheme … An example of good planning.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Why E?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>“Good planning” implies the scheme is <strong>well designed</strong>, not that more investment is needed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Tip:</strong> Words like <strong>good planning, successful introduction</strong> point to <strong>well-designed system</strong>.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>You answered:</strong> C (expanded too quickly)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Correct answer:</strong> A (disappointing)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recording clue:</strong></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Jake: “I can’t quite work out why it hasn’t been an instant success like some of the others. It’s a shame really.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Why A?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The speakers are <strong>disappointed</strong> because Sydney’s scheme hasn’t grown quickly.</p></li>
<li><p>“Expanded too quickly” is clearly <strong>incorrect</strong>, the opposite problem.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Tip:</strong> Listen for phrases like <strong>“it’s a shame / disappointing / not as expected”</strong> — these indicate disappointment.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>✅ <strong>Summary of error pattern:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Confused <strong>emotions/opinions</strong> (surprised vs.&nbsp;well designed, disappointing vs.&nbsp;too fast).</p></li>
<li><p>Misinterpreted <strong>investment vs.&nbsp;expansion</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Need to pay attention to <strong>phrases that indicate judgment</strong>: “strange,” “it’s a shame,” “hopefully that’ll change.”</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>You wrote:</strong> SPICIES</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Correct answer:</strong> SPICE(S)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>In the recording, it says: <em>“The sailors were carrying spices back to Europe…”</em></p></li>
<li><p>The word is <strong>uncountable in general form but plural “spices” is also acceptable</strong>, depending on IELTS transcript.</p></li>
<li><p>You added an extra “i” → spelling mistake.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Tip:</strong> For listening, always double-check spelling of commonly confused words. In IELTS, <strong>singular vs plural is important</strong> only if explicitly indicated. Here <strong>spice(s)</strong> is accepted.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>You wrote:</strong> FORESTS</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Correct answer:</strong> FOREST</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Recording: <em>“This meant that the forest that has once covered all the island… was cut down…”</em></p></li>
<li><p>Even though there were multiple forested areas, the text refers to <strong>the forest as one entity covering the island</strong>, so <strong>singular</strong> is correct.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Tip:</strong> Look for <strong>“the” + noun</strong> in the recording; singular form is usually required.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>✅ <strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Plural vs singular</strong>: Listen carefully for “the” — often signals singular.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Spelling</strong>: Watch for small errors in familiar words like <em>spice(s)</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>IELTS Listening</strong> is strict: one-word answers must match the recording exactly.</p></li>

<p><strong>Type:</strong> Multiple choice (details about a talk / instructions)</p>
<p><strong>Skills tested:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Recognising paraphrase in distractors</p></li>
<li><p>Listening for <em>specific details</em> rather than topic words</p></li>
<li><p>Maintaining focus during fast option switches</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Common reasons for mistakes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Distractor trap:</strong> The speaker may mention <em>all</em> the options, but only one is true for the context.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Over-reliance on key words:</strong> You may have matched words in the audio directly to the option rather than the meaning.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Losing track in double-question format:</strong> When 2 MCQs come together (like Q11–12), if you miss one small detail for Q11, it can throw off Q12 as well.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fix:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Train to <strong>underline key differences</strong> between options before audio starts.</p></li>
<li><p>Expect <em>paraphrase</em> — options often use synonyms (e.g., “easy to reach” = “accessible”).</p></li>

<p><strong>Type:</strong> Matching / table completion (short answer)</p>

<li><p>Mapping speakers’ ideas to given categories</p></li>
<li><p>Distinguishing between similar-sounding items</p></li>
<li><p>Understanding <strong>speaker opinion</strong> vs.&nbsp;factual description</p></li>

<p><strong>Common reasons for mistakes:</strong></p>

<li><p><strong>Following the wrong speaker</strong> in a multi-speaker part.</p></li>
<li><p>Hearing <em>two possible answers</em> but not catching the conclusion phrase like <em>“OK, let’s do that”</em>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fix:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Listen for <strong>decision signals</strong>: “Let’s go with…”, “We’ve decided on…”, “Forget that idea…”.</p></li>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> “Check ethical guidelines for working with (27) …” → Correct answer: <strong>humans/people</strong></p>
<p><strong>Likely reason for mistake:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Plural/singular issue</strong> — you said earlier you tend to miss plural endings in fast speech.</p></li>
<li><p>Possibly misheard as “human research” or “human testing” and didn’t think of the base form “humans.”</p></li>
<li><p>You might have expected a <strong>field/area</strong> (like “psychology” or “participants”) instead of the subject of the research.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fix:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>For plural prediction:</p>
<ul>
<li>After “working with…”, ask: <em>Are they referring to a countable group?</em> If yes → expect plural (humans, students, patients).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>In listening, watch for <strong>/z/ or /s/</strong> endings even when very soft.</p></li>
<li><p>Do “plural ending dictation” drills — play 1–2 second clips, write only the last word, mark plural/singular.</p></li>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Notice how <strong>with + people</strong> tends to be plural, while <strong>human</strong> before a noun is often an <strong>adjective</strong> (e.g., <em>human subjects</em>), which flips the number decision to the noun (<em>subjects</em> → plural).</p>

<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Cambridge IELTS 16 - listening test 1</h1>
<ul>
<li>Total Score: 34/40</li>
<li>Date: 15/08/2025</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="performance-summary" class="level1" data-number="2">
<h1 data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Performance Summary</h1>
<p><strong>Part 1 – Why We Need to Protect Polar Bears</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Accuracy:</strong> 13/13 correct.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Perfect performance in TRUE/FALSE/NOT GIVEN and ONE WORD ONLY tasks. Excellent trap recognition and precise detail matching.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Comment:</strong> Section mastered — no need to adjust approach.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Part 2 – The Step Pyramid of Djoser</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Accuracy:</strong> 5/7 correct — wrong on Q14, Q16, Q20 (<em>Matching Headings</em>).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Error Pattern:</strong> Chose headings based on interesting details rather than the main focus of the paragraph.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Strong in factual detail scanning — all gap-fill and multiple-choice correct.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Next Step:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Summarise paragraph in 3–5 words before looking at heading options.</p></li>
<li><p>Ignore eye-catching details if they are not the paragraph’s central theme.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Part 3 – The Future of Work</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Missed Q27, Q29 (matching opinions) and Q38 (detail).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Q27 &amp; Q29:</strong> Mistakes came from assuming a viewpoint matched a keyword in the text without confirming the <em>speaker</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Q38:</strong> Selected a number mentioned near the topic but not actually answering the question.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Good understanding of main arguments and vocabulary — errors were precision-related, not comprehension-related.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Next Step:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>For matching opinions: underline the <em>speaker’s name</em> and scan for synonyms of their view, not just keywords from the question.</p></li>
<li><p>For figures: re-check the exact question demand (time period, category, or scope) before selecting.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Overall Reading Estimate:</strong> ~34/40 → Band 8.0.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Detail scanning, strong vocabulary comprehension, accurate in TFNG.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Matching Headings (Part 2) and attribution for opinions (Part 3), plus occasional number/date misreads.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Improvement Plan:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>10-min daily drill: 4–5 matching headings + 4–5 matching opinions mixed.</p></li>
<li><p>Weekly “trap review” of number/date questions.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>If you <strong>force yourself after each part</strong> to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Locate the cue</strong> — highlight or underline the exact sentence/phrase in the passage that justifies your answer.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Check it matches the question’s scope</strong> — time frame, subject, and perspective all match.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Check you didn’t use background knowledge</strong> — only the text.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This “cue verification” step will:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Stop heading mistakes (because you’ll see if your heading matches the <em>whole</em> paragraph, not just a detail).</p></li>
<li><p>Stop opinion mix-ups (you’ll confirm the cue is linked to the right person).</p></li>
<li><p>Stop number/date errors (you’ll double-check it’s the one the question asked for).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It might add <strong>2–3 minutes per section</strong> in practice now, but by test day it will be automatic.</p>

<section id="true-false-not-given-questions-17-analysis-traps" class="level2" data-number="3.1">
<h2 data-number="3.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="true-false-not-given-questions-17-analysis-traps"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> <strong>True / False / Not Given (Questions 1–7) — analysis &amp; traps</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Q1.</strong> <em>Polar bears suffer from various health problems due to the build-up of fat under their skin.</em> — <strong>FALSE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Why:</strong> Passage says humans with similar fat would be obese and get diabetes/heart disease <strong>but</strong> “the polar bear experiences no such consequences.” That directly contradicts the statement.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trap:</strong> The text compares humans → distracts you into thinking fat = illness. Always check who the comparison refers to.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q2.</strong> <em>The study done by Liu and his colleagues compared different groups of polar bears.</em> — <strong>FALSE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Why:</strong> The study compared <strong>polar bears with brown bears</strong> (their relatives in warmer climates), not different groups of polar bears.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trap:</strong> The word <em>compared</em> appears — setters try to trick you by changing the comparison object (groups of polar bears vs.&nbsp;polar vs.&nbsp;brown).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q3.</strong> <em>Liu and colleagues were the first researchers to compare polar bears and brown bears genetically.</em> — <strong>NOT GIVEN</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Why:</strong> The passage reports the study and its findings but <strong>does not say</strong> whether they were the first to do such a comparison. No info = NOT GIVEN.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trap:</strong> “First” is a strong claim — absence of explicit wording = NOT GIVEN.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q4.</strong> <em>Polar bears are able to control their levels of bad cholesterol by genetic means.</em> — <strong>TRUE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Why:</strong> Liu et al.&nbsp;found a gene (APoB) in polar bears that reduces LDL (“bad” cholesterol). The statement paraphrases that genetic basis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trap:</strong> Watch words like <em>control</em> — here it’s acceptable because the passage attributes the LDL reduction to a gene.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q5.</strong> <em>Female polar bears are able to survive for about six months without food.</em> — <strong>TRUE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Why:</strong> The passage explicitly describes ~six months of fasting in maternity dens. That matches “survive…without food.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trap:</strong> None big — exact phrase appears.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q6.</strong> <em>It was found that the bones of female polar bears were very weak when they came out of their dens in spring.</em> — <strong>FALSE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Why:</strong> The study found <strong>no evidence of significant loss of bone density</strong> when they emerged. The statement says the opposite.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trap:</strong> Be careful with negative wording (“no evidence” vs “very weak”) — they flip meaning.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q7.</strong> <em>The polar bear’s mechanism for increasing bone density could also be used by people one day.</em> — <strong>TRUE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Why:</strong> The passage: <em>“If the mechanism … can be understood, many bedridden humans, and even astronauts, could potentially benefit.”</em> That directly supports the statement.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trap:</strong> “Could be used” is hypothetical — passage uses the same conditional; therefore TRUE.</p></li>

<section id="table-completion-questions-813-exact-word-justification-distractors" class="level2" data-number="3.2">
<h2 data-number="3.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="table-completion-questions-813-exact-word-justification-distractors"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> <strong>Table completion (Questions 8–13) — exact-word justification &amp; distractors</strong></h2>
<p>You answered: <strong>8 VIOLENT, 9 TOOL, 10 MEAT, 11 PHOTOGRAPHER, 12 GAME, 13 FRUSTRATION.</strong> All correct. Here’s why and what to watch for.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Q8 VIOLENT</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Where:</strong> “Bears… seem to be perceived as stupid and in many cases violent.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trap:</strong> Passage also uses <em>stupid</em> — the question asks for the contrasting perception, so <strong>violent</strong> is the precise word.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Q9 TOOL</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Where:</strong> Tennoji Zoo — “used a tree branch on multiple occasions to dislodge a piece of meat…” → branch used as a <strong>tool</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trap:</strong> Could be tempted by synonyms like “instrument” — but the exam demands the word used in the text (TOOL).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Q10 MEAT</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Where:</strong> The branch was used “to dislodge a piece of <strong>meat</strong> hung out of his reach.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trap:</strong> “Food” or “prey” are possible distractors, but MEAT is the exact word used.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Q11 PHOTOGRAPHER</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Where:</strong> Wild bear “ran and jumped onto barrels in an attempt to get to a <strong>photographer</strong> standing on a platform four metres high.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trap:</strong> Don’t pick “platform” — the question asks who was on the platform (photographer).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Q12 GAME</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Where:</strong> Annes observed bears “putting objects in piles and then knocking them over in what appeared to be a <strong>game</strong>.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trap:</strong> “Play” is tempting, but the passage says <strong>game</strong> — and the instruction required ONE WORD ONLY.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Q13 FRUSTRATION</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Where:</strong> “They may make movements suggesting <strong>frustration</strong> if disappointed when hunting.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trap:</strong> “Anger” or “aggression” could seem plausible, but <strong>frustration</strong> is the explicit emotion named.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h1 data-number="4"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> <strong>Test strategy reminders &amp; why you didn’t fall for traps</strong></h1>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Find the exact sentence that relates to the statement</strong> — you did this well. TFNG requires reference-level precision, not general sense.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Watch comparisons carefully</strong> (Q1, Q2). The passage often compares species or humans — note exactly who the comparison applies to.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be wary of “first / always / never / all”</strong> claims — these often lead to NOT GIVEN or FALSE unless explicitly stated.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use the passage wording for table completions.</strong> The exam usually expects the exact word or an obvious synonym used in the text; because you used the words actually in the passage, you were correct.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Single-word answers:</strong> follow the instructions strictly — ONE WORD ONLY, correct form. (e.g., GAME not “playing”.)</p></li>

<h2 data-number="5.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="q14-paragraph-a"><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> <strong>Q14 — Paragraph A</strong></h2>
<p><strong>You chose:</strong> VI (pyramid design others copied) — <strong>Wrong</strong></p>
<p><strong>Correct:</strong> IV</p>
<p><strong>Why IV?</strong></p>
<p>Paragraph A is saying: “There’s long debate about pyramid evolution, but <em>one</em> certain fact remains — it began with this single monument designed by one architect.” That is literally <em>one certainty among other less definite facts</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Key cue:</strong> <em>“However, there is no question that… it began with one monument … designed by one brilliant architect.”</em> → main idea = a single certainty.</p>
<p><strong>Why VI is tempting but wrong:</strong> VI (others copied the design) is true for the passage overall, but Paragraph A is not about later pyramids copying Djoser’s — it’s about the <em>certainty that the pyramid story begins here</em>. The “copy” idea is stated later (paragraph G).</p>

<h2 data-number="5.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="q16-paragraph-c"><span class="header-section-number">5.3</span> <strong>Q16 — Paragraph C</strong></h2>
<p><strong>You chose:</strong> IV — <strong>Wrong</strong></p>
<p><strong>Correct:</strong> II (A difficult task for those involved)</p>
<p><strong>Why II?</strong></p>
<p>Paragraph C describes <em>experimentation</em> and <em>construction challenges</em>: multiple plans, weight issues, inward inclines to prevent collapse. The emphasis is on the <strong>builders’ challenge</strong> and difficulty.</p>
<p><strong>Key cue:</strong> <em>“Much experimentation was involved… The weight of the enormous mass was a challenge for the builders…”</em> → main idea = difficulty of the task.</p>
<p><strong>Why IV was tempting but wrong:</strong> Paragraph C discusses construction stages, but the focus is the <strong>practical difficulty</strong>, not a “single certainty” like paragraph A. So II fits better.</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="q20-paragraph-g" class="level2" data-number="5.4">
<h2 data-number="5.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="q20-paragraph-g"><span class="header-section-number">5.4</span> <strong>Q20 — Paragraph G</strong></h2>
<p><strong>You chose:</strong> II — <strong>Wrong</strong></p>
<p><strong>Correct:</strong> VI (A pyramid design that others copied)</p>
<p><strong>Why VI?</strong></p>
<p>Paragraph G explicitly states the Step Pyramid’s <em>revolutionary</em> role and that it became the <strong>archetype</strong> other pyramid builders followed.</p>
<p><strong>Key cue:</strong> <em>“this pyramid complex constitutes a milestone… The Step Pyramid was a revolutionary advance … became the archetype which all the other great pyramid builders of Egypt would follow.”</em> → main idea = copied/imitated design.</p>
<p><strong>Why II was tempting but wrong:</strong> Paragraph G praises importance and influence; it doesn’t emphasise difficulty. The “challenge” language was in paragraph C.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Read the paragraph before looking at headings.</strong></p>
<p>Form a 3–5 word summary of the <em>main idea</em> (not details).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Check the topic sentence (first or last sentence).</strong></p>
<p>IELTS paragraphs often signal the main idea there.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Match meaning, not words.</strong></p>
<p>Headings use paraphrase. Look for synonyms and concept-level matches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Compare scope.</strong></p>
<p>Headings that sound correct but are <em>too narrow</em> (detail) or <em>too broad</em> can be rejected.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Eliminate distractors that match only one example.</strong></p>
<p>If a heading matches just one sentence or example, it’s likely a trap.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use process of elimination.</strong></p>
<p>If two headings seem possible, prefer the one that covers the <em>entire</em> paragraph.</p></li>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> The first paragraph tells us about…</p>
<p><strong>Why wrong:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>You were distracted by the mention of <em>embodied AI</em> vs <em>disembodied AI</em> in the paragraph, which matches option <strong>D</strong> superficially.</p></li>
<li><p>The real focus of the first paragraph was <strong>how AI will alter the nature of work</strong> — global workforce adaptation, job switching, evolving occupations — not the differences between AI types.</p></li>
<li><p>Mention of embodied vs disembodied AI was an <em>example</em>, not the main message.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lesson:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Look for the main idea of the paragraph, not interesting side points.</strong> In IELTS, side points often match wrong options perfectly (distractor trap).</p></li>
<li><p>Strategy: Before looking at the options, summarise the paragraph in <strong>5 words</strong> in your head, then match the option that fits.</p></li>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> What did Pachidi observe at the telecommunications company?</p>
<p><strong>Why wrong:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>You probably saw that staff were “dependent” on the algorithm and linked it to “allowing AI to carry out tasks they ought to do themselves” (D).</p></li>
<li><p>But the key detail in the passage: <em>“workers feed the algorithm with false data to reach their targets”</em> — this is actively <strong>manipulating the AI</strong> to get the result they want → <strong>C</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>D is too passive; the staff were active in <em>making sure AI produced desired results</em>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lesson:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>In “what did they observe” questions, <strong>focus on the concrete action</strong> observed, not the general behaviour.</p></li>
<li><p>Strategy: Underline verbs showing action in the text — that’s usually what the correct answer will reflect.</p></li>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> It is important to be aware of the range of problems that AI causes.</p>
<p><strong>Why wrong:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>C (Ewan McGaughey) talks about policy and social reform, but <strong>awareness of problems</strong> was actually from Pachidi’s perspective: “We need to make sure we fully understand the dilemmas that this new world raises…”</p></li>
<li><p>You may have been matching the idea of “problems” with “unemployment” in McGaughey’s section, but that’s too narrow.</p></li>
<li><p>The original statement is broader — “dilemmas” = a <em>range</em> of potential problems.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lesson:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>When matching researchers, look for the <em>scope</em> of the statement: if the question says “range of problems”, check whether the person talks broadly or narrowly.</p></li>
<li><p>Strategy: Mark in the margin the “theme” each researcher covers, so you can match later without rereading everything.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>
<p>Your mistakes come from <strong>picking the tempting partial match</strong> instead of the <em>most complete match to the main idea</em>.</p>
<p>This is <strong>classic for Band 8–8.5 readers</strong> — the jump to Band 9 means getting ruthless about:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Main idea extraction</p></li>
<li><p>Exact action identification</p></li>
<li><p>Scope matching</p></li>

<p>iii</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph B</strong></p>
<p>The main temple is surrounded by courtyards, gardens, and ceremonial halls. Nearby are the living quarters of the high priests, with tall walls separating the inner sanctum from the outer city.</p>
<p>ix</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph C</strong></p>
<p>The architect initially proposed a round structure, but later changed it to a square base for stability. Several more alterations followed before the final, striking form was approved.</p>
<p>x</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph D</strong></p>
<p>Built on an island and ringed with high walls, the fortress was accessible only through a narrow bridge. Hidden chambers and false passageways made it even harder for intruders to reach the treasure room.</p>
<p>ii</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph E</strong></p>
<p>The king was so impressed by the design that he insisted his adviser’s name be engraved on the main gate alongside his own — an unusual break from tradition.</p>
<p>iv</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph F</strong></p>
<p>Although the central statue had been stolen long ago, the intricate mosaics and painted ceilings still amazed archaeologists who explored the ruined palace.</p>

<p><strong>Paragraph G</strong></p>
<p>After months of trial and error, the builders finally found a way to balance the massive roof slabs without them collapsing under their own weight.</p>

<p><strong>Paragraph H</strong></p>
<p>During excavation, researchers found dozens of clay jars with inscriptions they could not decipher. The jars’ purpose remains a mystery, and experts still debate their meaning today.</p>

<hr>
<p>💡 <strong>Your Task</strong>: Match each paragraph (A–H) with one heading (i–x).</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You will not use all the headings — some are distractors.</p>

<section id="cambridge-ielts-16---listening-test-1" class="level1" data-number="1">
<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Cambridge IELTS 16 - listening test 1</h1>
<ul>
<li>Total Score: 37/40</li>
<li>Date: 14/08/2025</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="performance-summary" class="level1" data-number="2">
<h1 data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Performance Summary</h1>
<p>All my mistakes in that test were related to singular/plural prediction.</p>
<p>Today i get 37/40 ielts, all wrong in plural/singular, I can learn the acceptance/decline type question in task 3 of the previous test, and do the test correctly</p>
<p>I think maps in listening is my advantage, i can look at the map and easier to think and hear.</p>
</section>
<section id="recording-1" class="level1" data-number="3">
<h1 data-number="3"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Recording 1</h1>
<p>It looks like your mistake in <strong>Q8</strong> (“WEDNESDAY” vs.&nbsp;“WEDNESDAYS”) comes down to a common IELTS listening trap — <strong>plural vs.&nbsp;singular forms</strong>.</p>
<p>Here’s why:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Exact wording in the audio</strong></p>
<p>Sarah says:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“…so we moved them to <strong>Wednesdays</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>She’s talking about the <em>recurring schedule</em>, meaning <em>every Wednesday</em>, so the plural form is grammatically correct.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Why singular “Wednesday” is wrong</strong></p>
<p>IELTS marking is strict — the answer must match exactly what’s said in the recording (spelling and plurality included).</p>
<p>Even though “Wednesday” might make sense to you as a day, it’s not what the speaker said, so it’s marked wrong.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Key listening clue</strong></p>
<p>When you hear a <strong>day of the week</strong> in plural form, it usually means a repeated weekly event:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“Classes are on Mondays.” (every Monday)</p></li>
<li><p>“Meetings take place on Fridays.” (every Friday)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Tip to avoid this mistake</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>When listening, always pay attention to <strong>-s</strong> endings on days, months, and nouns.</p></li>
<li><p>In notes completion tasks, write <em>exactly</em> what you hear, even if you think the singular sounds more natural.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>In natural English, that final /s/ is often very soft or blended into the next word, so it’s almost invisible unless you train your ear.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can <em>predict</em> plural vs.&nbsp;singular even when you don’t hear the sound clearly:</p>
<hr>
<section id="use-grammar-logic" class="level3" data-number="3.0.1">
<h3 data-number="3.0.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="use-grammar-logic"><span class="header-section-number">3.0.1</span> <strong>Use grammar logic</strong></h3>
<p>Look at the sentence structure and the verb form.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Plural</strong> → often with plural verbs:</p>
<p>“We moved them to <strong>Wednesdays</strong>.” → <em>them</em> = many classes → must be plural days.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Singular</strong> → often with “this” or “next”:</p>
<p>“It’s on <strong>Wednesday</strong> next week.” (one time only)</p></li>
</ul>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="listen-for-context" class="level3" data-number="3.0.2">
<h3 data-number="3.0.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="listen-for-context"><span class="header-section-number">3.0.2</span> <strong>Listen for context</strong></h3>
<p>Ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Is this talking about a <strong>regular schedule</strong>? → plural.</p></li>
<li><p>Is it a <strong>single event</strong>? → singular.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In Q8’s case, they were talking about the <em>regular weekly class</em>, so “Wednesdays” fits.</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="watch-for-connecting-sounds" class="level3" data-number="3.0.3">
<h3 data-number="3.0.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="watch-for-connecting-sounds"><span class="header-section-number">3.0.3</span> <strong>Watch for connecting sounds</strong></h3>
<p>Native speakers link words:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“on Wednesdays at ten” might sound like <strong>“on Wenzdaysat ten”</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>The /s/ merges into the “at” sound, so you don’t hear it as a separate hiss.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can train your ear by slowing down recordings (0.75x speed) and replaying just the day-of-week phrases.</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="use-prediction-before-the-audio" class="level3" data-number="3.0.4">
<h3 data-number="3.0.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="use-prediction-before-the-audio"><span class="header-section-number">3.0.4</span> <strong>4. Use prediction before the audio</strong></h3>
<p>Before listening, scan the notes:</p>
<p>If you see “Held on (8) ______ from 10 am to 11 am” and the topic is weekly workshops → 80% chance it’s plural.</p>

<p>I’m wrong in 39 and 40, both in plural/singular prediction.</p>
<p>☑️&nbsp;In&nbsp;business,&nbsp;people&nbsp;benefit&nbsp;from&nbsp;Stoicism&nbsp;by&nbsp;identifying&nbsp;obstacles&nbsp;as&nbsp;<strong>(39)</strong>&nbsp;……………………….. .</p>
<p><strong>Relevance&nbsp;of&nbsp;Stoicism</strong><br>
☑️&nbsp;It&nbsp;requires&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot&nbsp;of&nbsp;<strong>(40)</strong>&nbsp;………………………..&nbsp;but&nbsp;Stoicism&nbsp;can&nbsp;help&nbsp;people&nbsp;to&nbsp;lead&nbsp;a&nbsp;good&nbsp;life.</p>
<p>Let’s break down why <strong>Q39</strong> and <strong>Q40</strong> were <em>singular</em> despite your prediction:</p>
<hr>
<section id="q39-obstacles-opportunity" class="level3" data-number="7.4.1">
<h3 data-number="7.4.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="q39-obstacles-opportunity"><span class="header-section-number">7.4.1</span> <strong>Q39: Obstacles → opportunity</strong></h3>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“…Stoics teach <strong>turning obstacles into opportunity</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Why singular?</strong></p>
<p>“Opportunity” here is an <em>uncountable concept</em> — like “freedom” or “happiness.”</p>
<p>The idea is that <em>all obstacles together</em> can be transformed into <em>the general idea of opportunity</em>, not multiple individual opportunities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Plural trap:</strong></p>
<p>The plural “obstacles” nearby makes our brain want symmetry (“opportunities”), but grammar meaning overrules symmetry here.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="q40-a-lot-of-practice" class="level3" data-number="7.4.2">
<h3 data-number="7.4.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="q40-a-lot-of-practice"><span class="header-section-number">7.4.2</span> <strong>Q40: A lot of → practice</strong></h3>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“It requires a lot of practice, but Stoicism can help people…”</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Why singular?</strong></p>
<p>“Practice” here is uncountable (meaning <em>the act of practising</em>).</p>
<p>Uncountable nouns don’t take plural even after “a lot of.”</p>
<p>Compare:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“a lot of work” ✅ (uncountable)</p></li>
<li><p>“a lot of books” ✅ (countable plural)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Plural trap:</strong></p>
<p>We’re trained to think “a lot of” = plural, but it only does that with countable nouns. ### <strong>The takeaway skill</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>When predicting plural/singular in listening:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Check the noun type</strong> in your head:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Countable →</strong> can be plural (“opportunities”) or singular (“opportunity”).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Uncountable →</strong> always singular form (“practice”).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Don’t be misled by nearby plurals</strong> — they don’t force the answer to match.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Listen for context meaning</strong>: Are they talking about <em>a general idea</em> or <em>individual items</em>?</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 data-number="7.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="q39-opportunity-vs-opportunities"><span class="header-section-number">7.5</span> <strong>Q39 – “opportunity” vs “opportunities”</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Transcript:</strong></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Stoics teach turning obstacles into opportunity.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>Here the word is <strong>singular</strong> (“opportunity”) because it’s talking about the general idea of <strong>seeing challenges as a single type of positive outcome</strong>, not listing multiple separate chances.</p></li>
<li><p>In IELTS listening, when the speaker uses <strong>into opportunity</strong> (no “an” or “the”), it’s usually uncountable or general — same as “into gold” or “into power.”</p></li>
<li><p>If it were plural, you’d hear a clearer “opportunities,” with a small /z/ sound at the end.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong></p>
<p>If the word follows <strong>“into”</strong> and is used conceptually, lean towards singular.</p>

<p><strong>Transcript:</strong></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>This is not as easy as it sounds and will require considerable practice.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>Here it’s <strong>uncountable</strong> — meaning “a lot of doing something to improve a skill,” not “different methods” (which would be “practices”).</p></li>
<li><p>In IELTS listening, <strong>considerable</strong> often precedes uncountable nouns like “time,” “effort,” “practice,” “work.”</p></li>
<li><p>Plural “practices” would refer to “customs” or “ways of doing things” — different meaning.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong></p>
<p>If preceded by <strong>a lot of</strong>, <strong>considerable</strong>, <strong>much</strong>, <strong>little</strong>, or <strong>some</strong>, the noun is likely uncountable and singular.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>Nature of the mistake</li>
</ol>
<p>You wrote “STEUNFIRTS” instead of “STAUNFIRTH”.</p>
<p>This is a spelling accuracy issue in a Listening Form Completion question.</p>
<p>The audio clearly spelled it out: S-T-A-U-N-F-I-R-T-H.</p>
<p>You transposed letters (“E” instead of “A” and “S” instead of “H”).</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Why it happened</li>
</ol>
<p>Spelling under pressure: In IELTS Listening, names—especially unusual ones—often trip people up because they’re not in everyday vocabulary.</p>
<p>Letter confusion:</p>
<p>“AU” sound in “Staun-” might have sounded like “EU” to you.</p>
<p>Final “-th” might have sounded like “-ts” due to accent or fast pronunciation.</p>
<p>Not actively writing while hearing the spelling: If you only listen without visualising the word in your head letter-by-letter, errors creep in.</p>
<p>No quick check: Since the speaker spelled it, you could have matched your writing to the audio in real time.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Skills involved</li>
</ol>
<p>Spelling unusual words (especially names and place names)</p>
<p>Listening to letter sequences accurately</p>
<p>Linking sounds to correct English letter combinations (AU, TH, etc.)</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>How to avoid in future</li>
</ol>
<p>When a word is spelled in the audio:</p>
<p>Write each letter as you hear it—don’t try to write the whole word from memory first.</p>
<p>Say the letters in your head as you write (S…T…A…U…N…).</p>
<p>Check letter order before moving on.</p>
<p>Practice listening to spelled words:</p>
<p>Names: towns, people, brands</p>
<p>Especially with British accents, since “A” might sound like “eh” and “U” like “yoo” or “uh”.</p>
<p>Know common UK place name patterns:</p>
<p>“-th” endings, “AU” in “Staun-”, “-firth” meaning estuary. # Recording 2</p>

<li><p><strong>Q21 (detail meaning):</strong> You chose the <strong>topic around it</strong> (location/creation) rather than the <strong>new information</strong> signaled by “<strong>didn’t realise</strong>”. In IELTS Listening, phrases like <em>didn’t realise / I learned / I found out</em> point to the <strong>answerable discovery</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Q25 (speaker assignment):</strong> It’s an <strong>ownership</strong> trap. The test uses soft language: <em>“I could do that… unless…”</em> + acceptance <em>“That’s fine by me.”</em> → That confirms the first speaker <strong>keeps</strong> the task.</p></li>

</table>
<p>Patterns behind these mistakes (and how to fix them fast)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Plurals in Note Completion</li>
</ol>
<p>Cues for plural: were / include(d) / many / a number of / large numbers of.</p>
<p>Grammar check: If the clause around the blank has plural verbs/pronouns, your answer should likely be plural.</p>
<p>Collocations: access to newspapers (plural), new machines (plural).</p>
<p>Micro-drill (plural or singular?)</p>
<p>“There were several ___ installed last year.” → machines</p>
<p>“The rail network included ___ that carried adverts.” → newspapers</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>Why this happened</p>
<p>The phrase “goods for sale” appears right next to “improved lighting” in the audio. Your brain probably latched onto sale as the keyword, but the note’s blank is asking for the cause (improved lighting), not the object (goods).</p>
<p>This is a classic IELTS distractor — they place the correct word just before or after another tempting one.</p>
<p>Identify the blank’s role before listening — here it’s a cause in a “because of better ___” structure.</p>
<p>Mark function words in your notes: “better ___” → adjective + noun = likely a thing or quality, not an action.</p>
<p>Separate main idea from examples — “improved lighting” (main cause) … “goods for sale” (example).</p>
<p>35 – “New 35 … made factories necessary…”</p>
<p>Clue: “New ___ made factories necessary” → The verb made is plural-form agreement?</p>
<p>Not exactly — here, the sentence subject is “New ___” which could be singular or plural.</p>
<p>Logic clue: The text talks about “enormous new machines” (plural) producing goods faster. This isn’t one single invention, it’s a category of inventions.</p>
<p>Prediction: Likely plural because they’re talking about many different machines, not a single machine.</p>
<p>Plural signal: “Factories” (plural) + “people moved into towns” = scale effect → multiple pieces of machinery.</p>
<p>✅ Correct form: machines</p>
<p>36 – “… greater access to 36 ___ made people more aware…”</p>
<p>Clue: “greater access to ___ made people more aware” — here, access to usually takes an uncountable or plural countable noun.</p>
<p>Logic clue: They’re talking about railways transporting “newspapers” (plural) so thousands of people could read them.</p>
<p>Plural signal: “Greater access” suggests many copies/items, not a single publication. One newspaper wouldn’t reach “thousands” → must be plural.</p>
<p>✅ Correct form: newspapers</p>
<p>General Tips to Predict Plural in IELTS Listening</p>
<p>Look at the article/determiner before the blank:</p>
<p>“a/an” → singular</p>
<p>“the” / no article → could be plural or uncountable</p>
<p>“these / those / many / several” → plural</p>
<p>Check verb agreement if the blank is the subject:</p>
<p>Plural noun → plural verb (“are”, “make”)</p>
<p>Ask: Is it one thing or a category?</p>
<p>Broad concepts or lists → often plural.</p>
<p>Listen for plural -s / -z sound in the audio. Train your ear for it — IELTS often hides it in fast speech.</p>
<p>Think about realism: If the statement is about widespread change, plural is more logical.</p>

<p>Q15:</p>
<p>Alice says:</p>
<p>“Absolutely – we want to include all kids in the city – especially those who live on busy roads. It’s here that demand is greatest. Obviously, there isn’t such demand in wealthier areas… or in the suburbs where there are usually more places for children to play outside.”</p>
<p>Key phrases: “busy roads” and “demand is greatest.”</p>
<p>Interpretation: “most needed” (question wording) = where demand is greatest → that is areas with heavy traffic = option C.</p>
<p>Why the other options are wrong</p>
<p>A (wealthy areas) — contradicted directly: “there isn’t such demand in wealthier areas…”</p>
<p>B (quiet suburban areas) — contradicted directly: suburbs usually have more places for children to play, so demand is lower, not highest.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Likely reasons you chose the wrong answer</li>
</ol>
<p>You may have misheard “busy roads” (it’s easy to miss short phrases).</p>
<p>You may have focused on the nearby mention of “wealthier areas” or “suburbs” and confused the meaning (these are comparisons, not the location where demand is greatest).</p>
<p>You may not have linked the paraphrase: “demand is greatest” ↔︎ “most needed.”</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>How to avoid this kind of mistake (practical tips)</li>
</ol>
<p>Read question + options BEFORE the audio — underline key words: most needed, wealthy, suburbs, heavy traffic.</p>
<p>Predict: think what type of place/word you expect to hear (here: a place where children lack play spaces).</p>
<p>Listen for signal words: especially, it’s here that…, there isn’t… — they show emphasis/contrast.</p>
<p>Map paraphrases: match “busy roads” → “areas with heavy traffic”; “demand is greatest” → “most needed.”</p>
<p>Eliminate contradictions: if the speaker immediately says “there isn’t such demand…”, cross that option out.</p>
<p>Take a tiny note (one or two words) at the moment you hear the key phrase — e.g., write “busy roads / demand ↑”.</p>
<p>Don’t get distracted by other nearby details — check the exact sentence containing the answer.</p>
<p>I miss the word ’’isn’t such”, i hear that demand is greatest ….- &gt; wealthier areas</p>
<p>busy road -&gt; heavy traffic # Recording 3</p>
<p>Firstly, i choose STRUCTURE, i fix it to HOOK, i think the word ‘PROMINENT’ is like the hook ?</p>
<p>Quick transcript evidence (exact lines)</p>
<p>For Q24: Tom says “you’ll need to look at how the item is put together: what structure is it given? Bear in mind that not many people read beyond the first paragraph, so what has the journalist put at the beginning? And if, say, three are conflicting opinions… does one appear near the end…”</p>
<p>For Q25: Tom says “what’s the writer’s purpose, or at least the most important one… It may seem to be to inform the public, but often it’s that they want to create fear, or controversy, or to make somebody look ridiculous.”</p>
<p>Why Q24 = STRUCTURE, not HOOK</p>
<p>What the question asked: “the 24 … of the item, e.g.&nbsp;what’s made prominent” → this is about how the article is organised (order, emphasis, placement).</p>
<p>Tom’s exact word was structure (“how the item is put together”). That matches the required answer.</p>
<p>Why HOOK is wrong: a hook is only the attention‑grabbing opening/lead. The question is broader — it asks about the whole organisation/layout (where things are placed, what’s prominent), not just the opening line.</p>
<p>Takeaway: if the speaker talks about beginning / where opinions appear / what is prominent, the intended word is structure (organising principle), not just hook.</p>
<p>Why Q25 = PURPOSE, not OPINION</p>
<p>What Tom asked you to find: “what’s the writer’s purpose… It may seem to be to inform… often it’s that they want to create fear, or controversy…” — these are intentions/aims (to inform, to upset, to ridicule). That’s purpose.</p>
<p>Why OPINION is wrong: Opinion = the writer’s view or stance on the subject (what they think). This is related but different: purpose = why they wrote it; opinion = what they think.</p>
<p>Tip: Listen for verbs/phrases like “to inform”, “to create fear”, “to make somebody look…” — these signal purpose/aim, not merely opinion.</p>
<p>Practical listening tips to avoid these mistakes</p>
<p>Listen for the exact phrasing. Exam writers often use the same word (e.g., structure, purpose). If you hear it, use it.</p>
<p>Map categories, not single features. Decide whether the speaker talks about organisation (structure), intention (purpose), viewpoint (opinion) or technique/device (hook/headline/graphic).</p>
<p>Spot signal words:</p>
<p>Structure → put together, beginning, end, first paragraph, prominent, what is made prominent</p>
<p>Purpose → to inform, to persuade, to create fear/controversy, want to…</p>
<p>Opinion → believes, thinks, argues, suggests</p>
<p>Hook → attention, grab, lead, opening line</p>
<p>Predict the word type before listening (noun/adjective/plural). That helps you choose between similar options.</p>
<p>Underline/mark the question phrase (e.g., “what … of the item”) so you know whether it asks for organisation, intention, or content.</p>
<p>Small practice (quick drill)</p>
<p>Read these short cues and say which label fits: STRUCTURE / PURPOSE / OPINION / HOOK</p>
<p>“They put the critical detail in paragraph five, where few read.” → STRUCTURE</p>
<p>“The article seems designed to alarm readers about rising costs.” → PURPOSE</p>
<p>“The journalist argues that schools are underfunded.” → OPINION</p>
<p>“The opening sentence uses a shocking fact to grab attention.” → HOOK</p>

<p>So the speaker explicitly says “turning salt into soda ash.” The word you must fill is SALT.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Why your answer “SOAPS” is wrong</li>
</ol>
<p>Doesn’t match the spoken phrase. The speaker mentions soap several times elsewhere, which can be a distractor, but here the verb phrase is “turning ___ into …” — the thing being turned into soda ash is salt, not soap.</p>
<p>Makes no logical sense in context. Soda ash (sodium carbonate) is an alkali used to make soap; you don’t make soda ash from soap. The passage later explains that soda ash combines with fat to form soap — so soap comes after, not before.</p>
<p>Grammatical fit. The notes ask “making soda ash from ___” so the missing word is a raw material (a substance): salt fits perfectly.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>How this mistake likely happened</li>
</ol>
<p>You heard nearby words like soap / soapmaking and jumped to that as the answer (a common trap).</p>
<p>You may have missed the short but crucial phrase “turning salt into…”, or mis-copied during note-taking.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>How to avoid this in future (practical tips)</li>
</ol>
<p>Pre‑read the question and predict the type of word needed (here: a substance/noun).</p>
<p>Listen for connecting words like into / from / by — they show transformation or source. (“turning X into Y” → X is the source).</p>
<p>Underline nearby keywords in the transcript while listening (e.g., turning…into, soda ash).</p>
<p>Don’t be fooled by repeated topic words (e.g., soap). Check the exact sentence for the answer.</p>
<p>Take minimal notes (1–2 letters) of the key word when you hear it — faster than trying to write the whole word immediately.</p>
<p>If you’re unsure, use logic: ask whether the proposed answer makes sense in the sequence described (what comes before and after).</p>

<p>Summarise&nbsp;the&nbsp;information&nbsp;by&nbsp;selecting&nbsp;and&nbsp;reporting&nbsp;the&nbsp;main&nbsp;features,&nbsp;and&nbsp;make&nbsp;comparisons&nbsp;where&nbsp;relevant._</p>

<p>First write:</p>
<p>The table illustrates the number and the proportion of temporary migrant workers in four countries - New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Australia, and the United States from 2003 to 2006. Overall, the number of migrant workers in New Zealand and the United States increased mildly in the 3-year period, while the other two countries experienced a steady rise in migrant workers.</p>
<p>New Zealand had the fewest migrant workers in both 2003 and 2006, ending the period at 87,000 people, but they have the most crowded in 2006 proportion with 21.1 per 1000 people. On the contrary, migrant workers of the United States were the largest in number, with 577,000 in 2003, and rose to 678,000 in 2006. Besides that, the rate of them was still the lowest in 4 countries, with just 2.3 per 1000 people.</p>
<p>The second largest number of migrant workers in 2003 was in Australia, with 152,000, and it increased sharply to 219,000 in 2006. While the United Kingdom began the period with 137,000 in 2003, it had nearly doubled by 2006 to 266,000 people, surpassing Australia, but the rate of the UK was just nearly half of Australia, respectively 4.4 and 10.7 per 1000 people in 2006.</p>

<p>Revised:</p>
<p>The table illustrates the number and proportion of temporary migrant workers in four countries - New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Australia, and the United States - between 2003 and 2006. Overall, all four nations experienced growth in their temporary migrant workers, although the scale of increase varied. While the United States consistently had the largest number of migrant workers, New Zealand recorded the highest proportion relative to its population.</p>
<p>In 2003, the United States employed the greatest number of temporary migrants, at 577,000, rising to 678,000 by 2006. Despite this, its proportion remained the lowest among the four, at only 2.3 per 1,000 people. In contrast, New Zealand had the smallest number of such workers, just 64,000 in 2003 and 87,000 in three year laters, but its rate was the highest, reaching 21.1 per 1,000 people in 2006.</p>
<p>Australia and the United Kingdom both saw notable growth. Australia’s figures climbed from 152,000 to 219,000, while the UK nearly doubled its total, from 137,000 to 266,000. However, by 2006, the rate of temporary workers in the UK remained roughly half that of Australia, at 4.4 and 10.7 per 1,000 people respectively.</p>

  <title>Public library</title>
  <dc:creator>Hung </dc:creator>
  <link>https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/w2-library/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>It is often argued that public libraries have become redundant due to the advancement of digital technologies that can fulfill the same purpose more efficiently. While computers and the internet have revolutionized the accessibility to information, I completely disagree that libraries are a waste of money; public libraries still play an irreplaceable social, educational, and cultural role.</p>
<p>On the one hand, it is undeniable that digital devices have transformed how people obtain and consume knowledge. With a single device, a person can have access to millions of books, academic journals, and databases, without having to leave the premises of their own house. This capacity has eliminated the practical need for public libraries, especially in more developed countries where widespread internet access is possible. Furthermore, maintaining libraries’ buildings, hiring staff, and updating archives require substantial public funding. These funds could be better invested in digital literacy programs or online resources that can reach a wider audience.</p>
<p>On the other hand, libraries continue to provide a unique value that technologies cannot replicate. First, they ensure equal access to knowledge for individuals who may not have the means to own a computer or to live in an area with sufficient internet coverage. For example, in many Central African countries, public libraries remain the only quiet and free spaces where students from disadvantaged communities can access educational materials. Moreover, public libraries foster social cohesion and intellectual culture through workshops, exhibitions, and nurturing a sense of a tight-knit community that can be hard to replicate in a large space like the internet. Finally, public libraries safeguard cultural heritage through the preservation of ancient manuscripts and scriptures, ensuring that future generations can access authentic historical materials beyond the digital space.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while digital devices have benefited the accessibility of knowledge, they cannot completely replace the functions and value of public libraries. Maintaining these archives is not a waste but a long-term investment into social equality, cultural preservation, and an intellectual community.</p>

  <title>How to write the Introduction paragraph in IELTS writing Task 2</title>
  <dc:creator>Hung </dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<section id="step-by-step-guide" class="level2" data-number="1">
<h2 data-number="1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-by-step-guide"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> <strong>Step-by-step guide</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Step 1 — Read the question carefully (2 minutes).</strong></p>
<p>Don’t skim. Identify:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>General topic</strong> (what broad area? e.g., “communication technology”).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Specific issue</strong> the question asks about (e.g., “negative effects on social relationships”).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Who/what focus</strong> (people, children, governments, companies…).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Instruction words</strong> (should, discuss, agree/disagree, advantages/disadvantages).</p>
<p><em>Why:</em> this prevents misrepresenting the question.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2 — Plan quickly (1–2 minutes).</strong></p>
<p>Decide your position and the two or three main points you will develop in the body paragraphs. Know which side you lean to (agree / disagree / partly). This lets you write a short, accurate thesis.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3 — Write a context sentence (general topic).</strong></p>
<p>Start with one sentence that introduces the subject in natural language. Keep it relevant — don’t use flashy “hooks.”</p>
<p>Example: “With advances in science and technology, the way we communicate has changed significantly.”</p>
<p><strong>Step 4 — Paraphrase the question’s specific issue (one sentence).</strong></p>
<p>Show you understand the exact task. Paraphrase — not invent synonyms for every word. Use natural language and keep key phrases if they’re the clearest choice.</p>
<p>Example: “Many people believe that modern ways of communicating might be having an adverse effect on relationships between people.”</p>
<p><strong>Step 5 — State your position (thesis) briefly (one sentence).</strong></p>
<p>Give a short, clear statement of your view — a full thesis, but <strong>compact</strong> (one sentence). If you will partly agree, include the nuance. Don’t write a mini-essay here. The thesis must match what you will develop in the body paragraphs.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Strong position: “However, I disagree and believe these technologies generally strengthen social bonds.”</p></li>
<li><p>Partly agree: “While there are some drawbacks, I believe the overall effect is positive.”</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 6 — Avoid common problems</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Don’t misrepresent or over-generalize the question.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t begin with irrelevant generalities or dramatic hooks.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t over-paraphrase (unnatural synonyms) that change meaning.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t present a long argument — save details for body paragraphs.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t end with “In this essay I will…” or “I will now prove that…” — be less personal.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 7 — Quick edit (30 seconds).</strong></p>
<p>Check that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You answered the exact question.</p></li>
<li><p>Your thesis matches planned body paragraphs.</p></li>
<li><p>Language is natural and not copied word-for-word too much.</p></li>
<li><p>No personal meta-comments (e.g., “I will discuss…”).</p></li>
</ul>

</ol>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>“With communication technologies becoming part of our everyday lives, the way we interact has changed. Many people claim that these developments harm interpersonal relationships. While there are some valid concerns, I believe these technologies are more likely to improve social connections.”</p>
<p><strong>Two-sentence (shorter):</strong></p>
<p>“One sentence that combines context + opposite view. One sentence with your qualified position.”</p>
<p>Example:</p>

<p>Investing in space exploration programs can provide two positive outcomes: developing economic and scientific research. Space programs can create new commercial advances and lead to benefits in the military industry. Consequently, the economic benefits can outweigh the cost. For example, there are new space tours for sale at a high price, and military industries are in enormous surplus in some countries, which can not be developed like now without the techniques from space programs. In terms of scientific research, these programs can expand the frontier of knowledge. It can be applied to help human life. Like the GPS system and satellites, which are products of previous projects that can be seen as a waste at first. Expanding human knowledge creates new opportunities for all people, which is why some people favor space exploration.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“For instance, technologies such as GPS and satellite communication—originally developed for space programs once considered wasteful—now play essential roles in daily life.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Final linking sentence could be more formal:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Thus, expanding human knowledge not only benefits societies worldwide but also strengthens the argument for continued investment in space exploration.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p>Investing in space exploration can generate two major benefits: economic growth and scientific advancement. Space programs stimulate commercial innovation and create spin-off technologies that drive related sectors such as aerospace and defense. Consequently, the economic returns often outweigh the initial cost. For example, space tourism has become a profitable industry, and many defense technologies originated from space research. In addition, these programs expand the frontiers of knowledge and often produce technologies that improve daily life. For instance, GPS and satellite communication - once viewed as costly experiments - now play essential roles in navigation and global connectivity. Therefore, by fostering both innovation and understanding, space exploration continues to deliver long-term benefits for humanity.</p>
<hr>
<p>Nevertheless, there are several problems in nations that need to be solved before outer space programs. Unlike developed countries, many countries in the world have a low living standard, especially poor countries. These countries must face challenges like diseases, drought, and many environmental problems that need an enormous amount of resources to solve. For instance, many countries in Africa still do not have clean water supplies and basic amenities, preventing them from developing in the modern day. Furthermore, the results of space programs do not directly help basic human lives, and most of them benefit rich people. Therefore, the lives of humans on earth should be invested in before the universe.</p>

<p><strong>Better version:</strong></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Therefore, governments should invest in improving life on Earth before exploring the wider universe.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, governments should prioritize solving urgent domestic issues before funding space programs. Unlike developed nations, many poorer countries still have low living standards and face challenges such as disease, drought, and environmental degradation, all of which require substantial resources to overcome. For example, many African nations still lack access to clean water and basic infrastructure, which continues to hinder their social and economic development. Furthermore, the outcomes of space programs rarely improve basic living conditions and tend to benefit wealthier nations or individuals. Therefore, governments should invest in improving life on Earth before exploring the wider universe.</p>
<hr>
<p>In conclusion, the benefits of space exploration can be worth the cost, but the money allocated to humans in nations is more needed. The lives of all people should be improved to a proper standard before getting the new opportunities in spaces, which are very costly.</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> “the benefits of space exploration can be worth the cost”</p>
<p>✅ Good idea, but the modal “can be” weakens your stance.</p>
<p>→ Better: “The benefits of space exploration <em>may justify</em> its cost” (more academic tone)</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> “but the money allocated to humans in nations is more needed.”</p>
<p>❌ “allocated to humans in nations” sounds unnatural and unclear.</p>
<p>You mean: “money spent on domestic issues” or “investment in citizens’ welfare.”</p>
<p>→ Better: “but the funds are more urgently needed to address pressing domestic problems.”</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> “The lives of all people should be improved to a proper standard before getting the new opportunities in spaces, which are very costly.”</p>
<p>❌ Issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“getting the new opportunities in spaces” → “spaces” ❌ plural and vague.</p></li>
<li><p>“getting” is informal; use “pursuing” or “exploring.”</p></li>
<li><p>“proper standard” → too general; use “adequate standard of living.”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>✅ Better: “Governments should ensure that citizens achieve an adequate standard of living before pursuing costly opportunities in outer space.”</p>
<p>In conclusion, while the benefits of space exploration may justify its cost, the funds are more urgently needed to address pressing social and economic problems on Earth. Governments should ensure that citizens achieve an adequate standard of living before pursuing ambitious and costly ventures in outer space.</p>

<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Writing about gender and age</h1>
<p>Cambridge IELTS 12, page 27</p>
<p><img src="https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/how-to-write-ielts-writing-task1-12/Pasted image 20251006211229.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><em>male</em> and <em>female</em> are adjectives (male students, female students, etc) but the same words are also nouns:</p>
<p><em>The number of females increased while the number of males decreased.</em></p>
<p>We might need to talk about ‘the female’ and ‘the male’ if we are given a life cycle of an animal, with charts and data, we are always writing about <strong>more than one</strong>, so we should not be using the singular form unless when we use it as a adjective.</p>
<p>In introduction and overview, we can make a general statement about <em>males</em> and <em>females</em>, or <em>men</em> and <em>women</em>. We can also add the nationality, to describe the main trends in the behavior of <em>Australian men</em> and <em>Australian women</em> in 2010. However, in our body paragraphs, we will mainly refer to the specific age groups.</p>
<p>We only use ‘stage’ or ‘period’ to talk about a stage or period in life. For example, ‘<em>childhood, the teenager years</em>’ and ‘<em>adulthood</em>’ are all examples of <em>stages</em> or <em>periods</em> in life. However, these terms are not appropriate for our data, which is divided into specific <em>age group</em> or <em>age ranges</em>.</p>
<section id="prepositions" class="level2" data-number="1.1">
<h2 data-number="1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="prepositions"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Prepositions</h2>
<p>Look at the following examples then the rules below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Women <font color="#245bdb">aged 25 to 34 …</font></li>
<li>Men <font color="#245bdb">aged between 35 and 44 …</font></li>
<li>Women <font color="#245bdb">who were 25 to 34 years old …</font></li>
<li>Men <font color="#245bdb">in</font> the <font color="#245bdb">25- to 35-year-old age group…</font></li>
<li>This fell <font color="#245bdb">from 24 years</font></li>
</ul>
<p>We use ‘at’ with ‘the age of’ and ‘in’ with an age group or range. When it comes to specific ages, we can used <em>aged, years old</em> or <em>year-old</em>. When giving data like this, we can also just write the ‘number + years’</p>
</section>
<section id="hyphens" class="level2" data-number="1.2">
<h2 data-number="1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="hyphens"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Hyphens</h2>
<p>We use hyphens when the number combines with ‘year-old’ to form a compound adjective or a compound noun. So, we can write the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>I taught a class of ten-year-olds. (compound noun - plural)</li>
<li>I taught a class of ten-year-old children. (compound adjective)</li>
</ul>
<p>If we are using a range of ages, we use a hyphen with both numbers in the range:</p>
<ul>
<li>I taught a class of 20- to 25-year-olds. (compound noun in a range)</li>
</ul>
<p>The final age group is often presented like this: 60+, 65+ etc. We can express this in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Men aged 60 and over …</li>
<li>Women aged 65 and above…</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="specific-age-groups" class="level2" data-number="1.3">
<h2 data-number="1.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="specific-age-groups"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Specific age groups</h2>
<p>A generation is generally seen as 25 years, so the groups in our data do not represent different generations. Teenagers are people aged thirteen to nineteen, so we cannot use this tern for the youngest age group, which goes up to 24. Be careful with ‘middle’ as it has a specific meaning when combine with ‘age’. <font color="#245bdb">Middle-aged</font> refers to people aged between approximately 40 and 60. You can refer to the ‘<font color="#245bdb">middle age groups</font>’ (meaning the groups in the middle), but you need to be careful in using this.</p>

<p>body paragraph 1</p>
<p>Adding sports facilities would certainly be an attractive idea to some. However, this proposal assumes that the main reason people are unhealthy is that they lack access to such facilities. In reality, many public health issues occur due to a combination of factors, and lack of exercises is only one of these. Among other key factors are poor diet, work stress, and a lack of time to address them. Furthermore, sophisticated equipment is not essential for getting fit; walking or running in the street would also achieve this. Thus, if a lack of facilities is not responsible for current health problems, simply adding more will not solve them.</p>
<p>body paragraph 2</p>
<p>Clearly, other measures are required to improve public health. If people lack the time to take care of themselves, then we need to find a way to address this. It may require a change in attitude, and to see taking time out from the pressures of work as healthy rather than a sign of laziness or weakness. If more people did this, not only would work stress be reduced, but they would also have more time to exercise. The issue of diet could be tackled by persuading people to cook nutritious meals themselves rather than choosing a faster alternative. Nevertheless, these solutions will take time and, for those who cannot reduce their working hours, are likely to be ineffective. Seemingly, when it comes to solving complex health problems, there is no simple solution.</p>
<p>Model answer</p>
<p>Public health is a growing concern, with many countries reporting increasing levels of obesity. Some believe the problem can be addressed by adding more sports facilities, while others think this may not be enough. A closer look at the problem will help in assessing these views.</p>

<p>In conclusion, in my view, giving people who are time-poor greater access to sports facilities will not be effective and is too simplistic a solution. Other measures are clearly required, but any action taken to improve public health requires a change in lifestyle, and this needs the cooperation of everyone involved.</p>
<section id="a-positive-or-a-negative-development" class="level1" data-number="1">
<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> A Positive or a negative development</h1>
<p>Our diet is becoming increasingly unhealthy. This is reflected in the fact that cheap, fast food, and sugary drinks are now found in many shops around the world. However, the low prices and convenience come at a cost.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the easy access to prepared meals and canned drinks has some advantages. Firstly, this type of food is abundant because it appeals to our taste buds. People would not eat it so often if they did not enjoy it. The low cost also means that people on a lower income can afford to feed their families, and it is made even more appealing because it also saves time in the kitchen. There are also now so many big businesses based on producing this type of food and drink that many workers are dependent on the selling or making of it, and this industry is a key employer of many lower income families. These advantages show that this development is likely to continue for some time.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the negative effects are significant. The low cost of fast food means that it has become more of a staple diet for many people. It is widely acknowledge that processed and sugary foods are unhealthy, so their widespread consumption is concerning. Such food contains many additives, offer little nutrition, and is largely seen as responsible for the growing obesity problems around the world. In addition, there are links to diabetes, all of which affects the economy as well as putting pressure on the healthcare system. Ultimately, the problem associated with this type of food have an impact on everyone.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the availability, convenience, and appeal of this type of food means that it is likely to be here to stay. Nevertheless, the long-term health effects show that, on the whole, this is a negative development. Finding a way to increase the cost would go some way to solving this.</p>
<p>staple diet = the main food/s eaten by a person or in a country</p>
<p>additives = chemicals added to food and drink (often to preserve or to add taste)</p>

<p>Use a different grammatical structure. Some useful examples of this are: changing a verb to a</p>
<p>noun; changing from active to passive; changing the focus of a sentence e.g.&nbsp;by making the object</p>
<p>of the sentence into the subject; or by beginning with the final idea. Look at the grammatical</p>
<p>changes I needed to make just by reversing the ideas in this sentence and changing the verb ‘to study’ into a noun:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It is better to study overseas than in your home town .</p></li>
<li><p>Studying in your home town has fewer advantages than studying overseas.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>1 Although celebrities have problems, there are plenty of advantages to being famous.</p>
<p>-&gt; Despite the benefits that fame brings, celebrities still have their problems.</p>
<p>2 Although celebrities have problems, there are plenty of advantages to being famous. (words to use: however; benefits; bring)</p>
<p>Fame brings plenty of benefits, however, being celebrity also have its problems.</p>
<p>3 All primary school children should be taught a foreign language (compulsory; curriculum)</p>
<p>Learning a foreign language should be a compulsory part of the primary school curriculum.</p>
<p>4 Children should learn a foreign language in primary school instead of high school. (better; rather)</p>
<p>It is better for children to learn a foreign language in primary school rather than in high school.</p>
<p>Being able to speak a second language is very useful.</p>
<p>-&gt; Some people argue that it is more beneficial / helpful to start this type of study at primary school instead of secondary school.</p>
<p>-&gt; Some people believe that it is best to do this at primary school instead of waiting until secondary school.</p>
<p>-&gt; Some people believe that beginning this type of study earlier than secondary school is beneficial to students.</p>
<p>-&gt; Some people believe that being taught such a skill earlier than secondary school is beneficial to students.</p>
<hr>
<p>The &lt;&gt; speak &lt;&gt; language is useful &lt;&gt;. However, &lt;&gt; some debate over &lt;&gt; age to learn a new language, with some, experts believing that this &lt;&gt; at &lt;&gt; . In my view, &lt;&gt; little &lt;&gt; starting.</p>
<p>&lt;&gt; to learning a foreign language early in life. The brains of young children are often compared to sponges &lt;&gt; ability to soak up knowledge. &lt;&gt; learn languages far more easily &lt;&gt; lack the self-consciousness &lt;&gt; interfere with language learning at high school, &lt;&gt; can be reluctant to make pronunciation mistakes in front of &lt;&gt; . &lt;&gt;, primary school students are happier to take risks &lt;&gt;, can have fun with &lt;&gt; learning. &lt;&gt; mastering a language takes a long time, &lt;&gt; to see &lt;&gt; recommend starting &lt;&gt;.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are several challenges to introducing a second language &lt;&gt;. Firtsly, &lt;&gt;, primary school students &lt;&gt; one teacher &lt;&gt;. This means the staff &lt;&gt; teach a foreign language. Secondly, &lt;&gt; in a child’s education; they &lt;&gt; the basics of literacy and numeracy &lt;&gt;. Thus, teachers do not have the time to &lt;&gt; words and phrases in another language. Furthermore, by &lt;&gt; , students &lt;&gt; of their mother tongue, which &lt;&gt; language. In fact, &lt;&gt; with first language acquisition. Therefore. the disadvantages &lt;&gt;.</p>
<p>In conclusion, there &lt;&gt; be limited &lt;&gt; studying a foreign language &lt;&gt; very &lt;&gt;, and &lt;&gt; &lt;&gt; these. &lt;&gt; school years &lt;&gt; stress-free &lt;&gt; children; adding &lt;&gt; their curriculum is &lt;&gt; after that for &lt;&gt;.</p>

<h1 data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> A step-by-step guide to essay writing</h1>
<p>Learning a new language can be challenging. While many people are able to do this in their own country, some choose to travel aboard to help with their studies. There are advantages and disadvantages to this.</p>
<p>The disadvantages of doing a language course overseas are significant. Firstly, there is the cost to consider. As well as flights and tuition fees, money is needed for day-to-day expenses, such as food and accommodation. Indeed, it may be too expensive for many. In addition, living away from family and friends can lead to loneliness, and being surrounded by a strange new culture can increase this sense of isolation. Such problems can even be severe enough to interfere with learning, thus defeating the object of the trip.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, these issues can generally be resolved, and there are definite rewards to studying a language in the country where it is the mother tongue. Although it may be expensive, students can get a part-time job to help meet their needs. Through work and school, they can socialize and make friends, and are likely to feel less homesick as a result. Any new culture feels strange at first, but it is also exciting and creates a much richer language learning experience; for example, through being able to enjoy the literature and music of the country. Furthermore, the access to native speaker teachers, and the total immersion in the language means it is possible to reach a far higher level than in your home town. Clearly, there is a lot to be gained from an opportunity like this.</p>
<p>To sum up, although some may struggle to adapt to the new culture and deal with financial issues, those who overcome these problems will undoubtedly be enriched by this invaluable experience. Therefore, in my view, the potential benefits more than make up for any disadvantages.</p>

<p>Keeping animals in captivity is cruel. There is no reason for zoos to exist in the 21st century.</p>
<p>How far do you agree or disagree with this opinion?</p>
<p>Around the world, people have differing opinions about zoos. Some people believe that keeping animals in captivity is wrong, while others contend that it is necessary and that we need zoos. In this essay, I will explore both of these views, as they each have some merit, before drawing a conclusion.</p>
<p>Proponents of zoos tend to argue that these places are intended to educate the public about animals. They claim that people can go to zoos and become more aware of serious environmental issues, and therefore, zoos are essential in raising awareness of serious issues. For example, children can visit zoos and learn about the majestic elephant, and then adapt their behavior to become more responsible people in the future. However, this argument assumes that all zoos treat their purpose as education, when in fact many zoos are geared towards entertainment, and many people come away from a zoo visit having learned relatively little.</p>
<p>Opponents of zoos claim that it is cruel to keep animals in captivity, and that therefore they belong in the wild. They point to numerous studies that show the suffering experienced by animals in even the best zoos. This is clear from evidence that many large animals require extensive space to roam that is just not available for them in their artificial enclosures, and so they suffer serious psychological and even physical damage. The fact that animals almost always live shorter lives in zoos is further proof of this fact.</p>
<p>In conclusion, although there are some good reasons for the existence of zoos, they probably should not be allowed to continue into the twenty-first century. Despite the positive efforts of some zoos, the suffering experienced by animals in captivity is simply unacceptable.</p>

<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Plan</h1>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>General topic:</p>
<p>The way animals are treated in captivity and the role of zoos in modern society.</p>
<p>Focus: Whether zoos are cruel and unnecessary in the 21st century.</p>
<p>Issues to discuss:</p>
<p>Should zoos be closed because they no longer serve a useful purpose, or do they still provide important benefits?</p>
<p>My initial position:</p>
<p>Although some people believe zoos are cruel and outdated, I disagree because they continue to play an essential role in conservation, education, and scientific research.</p>
<p>Themes:</p>
<p>Conservation of endangered species</p>
<p>Education and public awareness</p>
<p>Scientific research and animal welfare</p>
<p>Side A (Agree - zoos are cruel an unnescessary)</p>
<p>main topic:</p>
<p>Zoos are outdated institutions that no longer have a justifiable role in the 21st century</p>
<p>1 conservation</p>
<p>Zoos claim to conserve animals, but many species kept in zoos are not endangered. Resources would be better spent protecting habitats.</p>
<p>2 education</p>
<p>In the 21st century, people can learn through documentaries and VR instead of confining animals</p>
<p>3 Animal welfare</p>
<p>Animals in zoos are confined and can develop stress behavior</p>
<p>What did i show or prove? link to the question</p>
<p>Together, these points suggest that zoos may be seen as cruel and less relevant in the 21st century, since their conservation claims are limited, modern technology provides alternative education, and captivity can harm animal welfare.</p>
<p>Side B (Disagree - zoos are still nesecessary)</p>
<p>main topic: Despite criticisms, zoos remain necessary in the 21st century because they continue to play a vital role in conservation, education, and animal welfare. 1 conservation</p>
<p>However, zoos have had major conservation successes (e.g.&nbsp;pandas). For some species, the wild is no longer safe, so zoos are essential</p>
<p>2 education</p>
<p>seeing real animals in zoos has a stronger emotional impact, especially on children, leading to long-term awareness and conservation support</p>
<p>3 animal welfare</p>
<p>modern zoos focus on welfare, with large enclosures and enrichment activities, unlike circuses or outdated facilities</p>
<p>Link to the question:</p>
<p>Overall, these arguments demonstrate that zoos continue to serve an important purpose today by protecting endangered species, providing unique educational experiences, and ensuring high standards of animal welfare.</p>
<p>Conclusion - Summary of my main points While critics argue that zoos are outdated, unnecessary for conservation, and harmful to animals, they in fact continue to protect endangered species, educate the public, and maintain high standards of welfare.</p>
<p>Question to answer Are zoos cruel and unnecessary in the 21st century? My final position I disagree – zoos remain necessary today for conservation, education, and welfare.</p>
</section>
<section id="essay" class="level1" data-number="2">
<h1 data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Essay</h1>
<p>The way animals are treated in captivity and the role of zoos in modern society have long been debated. Some people argue that zoos are cruel and unnecessary in the 21st century, while others believe they continue to provide important benefits. Although some people view zoos as outdated institutions, this essay disagrees with that view, as they remain essential for social purposes.</p>
<p>On the one hand, critics argue that zoos no longer have a justifiable role in today’s world. Firstly, although zoos claim to conserve animals, many of the species they house are not endangered. From this perspective, the money and effort invested in maintaining these facilities could be better spent protecting natural habitats, where conservation has a broader and more lasting effect. Secondly, the educational value of zoos is often questioned. With the development of modern technology, such as documentaries, interactive media, and virtual reality, people can learn about wildlife without the need to confine animals. Finally, animal welfare is a major concern. Even in large enclosures, animals remain restricted, and some develop stress-related or abnormal behaviors. Together, these points suggest that zoos may be seen as cruel and less relevant in the 21st century.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are strong reasons to argue that zoos are still necessary. In terms of conservation, zoos have had real success in protecting species such as the giant panda and the black rhino, both of which might have faced extinction without intervention. For certain animals, the wild is no longer safe due to poaching, deforestation, and climate change, making captive breeding programs vital. Education is another important function. Seeing animals in real life has a much stronger emotional impact than watching them on a screen, particularly for children. This direct experience can create empathy and inspire long-term commitment to protecting wildlife. In addition, modern zoos have greatly improved in terms of animal welfare. They provide spacious enclosures, enrichment activities, and specialist veterinary care, making them fundamentally different from the exploitative conditions found in circuses or poorly managed facilities. Overall, these arguments demonstrate that zoos continue to serve an important purpose today.</p>
<p>In summary, while critics argue that zoos are outdated, unnecessary for conservation, and harmful to animals, they in fact continue to protect endangered species, educate the public, and maintain high standards of welfare. Therefore, in my view, zoos remain necessary in the 21st century for their vital role in conservation, education, and animal welfare.</p>

<p>1 The images presented in the media shows us …</p>
<p>2 celebrities are able to earn even more money by</p>
<p>3 The negative stories … sell more newspapers or attract more clicks</p>
<p>4 and the loss of privacy is</p>
<p>5 The wealth that fame brings is …</p>
<p>Fame and its impact on the lifestyle of celebrities fascinates many people. Because of this, stories about them help to sell thousands of newspapers and magazines. However, the benefits of fame are not without their challenges.</p>
<p>There are clear advantages to being famous. The images presented in the media show us celebrities enjoying an enviable lifestyle: they live in huge mansions, drive expensive cars, and wear the latest in high fashion. Thus, fame clearly brings great wealth. In addition, their frequent appearances in the media mean that celebrities have an influence that extends beyond their professional skills. This influence stems from the fact that young people want to be like them, and so the famous can earn even more money by endorsing different products and brands. Although just being in the spotlight may be rewarding, the main benefits of fame appear to be financial and material.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this level of fame also has its problems. The ability to influence others and the notion of fame itself are both dependent on appearing in the media on a regular basis, which means that celebrities have very little privacy. The same media that creates their fame is also very happy to share stories that are less positive. In fact, it could be argued that negative stories sell more newspapers or attract more clicks than any other. This puts an enormous amount of pressure not only on the individuals concerned, but also on the people close to them. As a result, their relationships and family life suffer. Clearly, the fortune that stems from fame comes at a substantial personal cost.</p>
<p>In summary, although there are clear financial benefits to being famous, there are also enormous personal challenges. In my view, the constant media attention is far too intrusive, and the loss of privacy is much too high a price to pay for the financial rewards.</p>
<p>‘Having said that’ is used to show contrast -e.g ‘The salary is very low. <em>Having said that</em>, it is still a good job.’</p>
<p>‘Apart from that’ is used to show contrast - e.g.&nbsp;‘<em>Apart from</em> the low salary, it is still a good job.’</p>
<p>Use ‘In addition’ to</p>
<p>Language of cause and effect: As a result / Because of this / For this reason</p>
<div class="callout callout-style-default callout-note callout-titled">
<div class="callout-header d-flex align-content-center">
<div class="callout-icon-container">
<i class="callout-icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="callout-title-container flex-fill">
Note
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Although ‘one’ can be used as a personal pronoun to refer to ‘people in general’, this include you yourself.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Fame undoubtedly changes a person’s life. Nevertheless, such changes are not aways for the better. In fact, for all professions, from movie stars to sports personalities, becoming a celebrity has challenges as well as benefits.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, fame can be extremely rewarding. Firstly, there is the sense of personal fulfillment that must come from making your family proud of what you have achieved. Secondly, celebrities can reap enormous financial rewards from their fame. On top of their fees, the famous have the potential to earn huge amounts of money from promoting luxury brands. This type of wealth is possible because celebrities are often seen as role models, and so people want to copy them and buy what they have. Therefore, being a focus for the world’s attention can be extremely lucrative.</p>
<p>However, achieving this status is not without its problems. First, celebrities can no longer live a normal live. If they visit public places, such as malls and bars, people will crowd around them demanding a picture or an autograph. To avoid this, the famous are forced to live in gated communities, visit the most expensive restaurants and hotels, and hire personal body guards for themselves and their families. Second, being a public figure means that your life is like an open book. The public love to gossip about the lives of celebrities, so it is almost impossible for them to have any privacy. Thus, the famous alternative between experiencing isolation and extremely invasive attention.</p>
<p>To sum up, while it is true that fame brings huge financial benefits, there are even more significant drawbacks. In my view, only those who successfully manage the problems associated with fame can truly be said to reap its rewards.</p>

  <title>Cutting Tools</title>
  <dc:creator>Hung </dc:creator>
  <link>https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/w1-diagram-rock/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>The diagram below shows the development of cutting tools in the Stone Age <img src="https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/w1-diagram-rock/Pasted image 20250922093627.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The diagram illustrates the evolution of the cutting tool during the period from 1.4 million years ago to 0.8 million years ago in the Stone Age.</p>
<p>It can be seen that a number of upgrades were made in the shape and size of the tool so that it could become a more effective cutting instrument.</p>
<p>1.4 million years ago, the tool was relatively primitive and resembled a natural stone, which suggests that little crafting was done. From the front and side view, Tool A had an oval shape, rough surface and blunt edges, hence presumably the inferior version compared to Tool B.</p>
<p>After 0.6 million years, the tool was upgraded into a spear-shaped instrument with the tip and edges being much sharper. While tool B was 10 centimeters long - the same length as Tool A, the surface of Tool B was crafted to be smoother and the overall width to be larger. Therefore, these features rendered this version more superior in terms of cutting effeciency.</p>

<section id="the-introduction-1" class="level2" data-number="1.1">
<h2 data-number="1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-introduction-1"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> The introduction</h2>
<p>There are no fixed governing what an introduction should look like or how many sentences it should contain. There are some key features to point out</p>
<section id="key-features-of-an-introduction" class="level3" data-number="1.1.1">
<h3 data-number="1.1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-features-of-an-introduction"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.1</span> Key features of an introduction</h3>
<p>Our introduction briefly tells the reader what they need to know before reading our argument. It should answer several questions:</p>
<p><em>What is the topic and focus of this essay? (i.e.&nbsp;the context for this essay)</em></p>
<p><em>What is the main issue or point that will be discussed in your essay?</em></p>
<p>Although this is only a short paragraph, there are varying approaches to how to write it, which appear to cause quite a lot of confusion. Because of this, there are some recurring problems. The first three have one common thread: getting started.</p>
</section>
<section id="problem-1---misrepresenting-the-question" class="level3" data-number="1.1.2">
<h3 data-number="1.1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="problem-1---misrepresenting-the-question"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.2</span> Problem 1 - Misrepresenting the question</h3>
<p>Many people are so keen to get started in their writing that they quickly skim read the test question. This can mean that they jump to a conclusion about what it means, or misinterpret it, and then misrepresent it in their introduction. The idea in their body paragraphs then move further and further away from the issue raised in the question, compounding the problem. Some candidates identify only the broad general topic within the question and write about this instead of the very specific issue they were asked to discuss.</p>
</section>
<section id="problem-2---making-a-general-statement" class="level3" data-number="1.1.3">
<h3 data-number="1.1.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="problem-2---making-a-general-statement"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.3</span> Problem 2 - Making a general statement</h3>
<p>Some people tell, ‘<em>I like to begin with a general statement</em>’. The danger here is that these are so general that they do not seem relevant to the issue raised in the question. Others begin their essays in a very rehearsed way that is often not accurate. For example, ‘<em>This is an often debated topic</em>’. Or ‘<em>This is a controversial topic</em>’, when in fact the issue in the question is not a common topic of conversation, or is rather mundane.</p>
</section>
<section id="problem-3---trying-to-use-a-hook" class="level3" data-number="1.1.4">
<h3 data-number="1.1.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="problem-3---trying-to-use-a-hook"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.4</span> Problem 3 - Trying to use a ‘hook’</h3>
<p>Some people begin an introduction with a ‘hook’, such as an interesting fact or statistic. Hooks are used by professional writers to grab the attention of the reader. Our examiner does not need to be persuaded to read our answer, and they do not need to be entertained by our writing. Even more importantly, a hook can seem out of place in a formal discursive essay, and they often seem irrelevant to the question.</p>
</section>
<section id="solution-1-read-the-test-question-carefully" class="level3" data-number="1.1.5">
<h3 data-number="1.1.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="solution-1-read-the-test-question-carefully"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.5</span> Solution 1: Read the test question carefully</h3>
<p>Although it is the first paragraph in our essay, our introduction should not be the starting point of our writing; we need to think carefully about the question, then think through and plan our whole argument first. We will never be asked to simply discuss a very broad topic such as ‘pollution’ or ‘technology’, so keep reading until we have fully understood exactly issue we are being asked to write about.</p>
<p>Pay particular attention to the words and phrases in the question that indicate the claim or argument that is being made, because this is what we must respond to in our answer to achieve a good Task response score. Typical words and phrases to look for are:</p>
<p><em>should, should always; should not; would be better; the only way; the best way, etc</em></p>
<p>If there are any words in the question we do not know, read the whole question again more slowly. Skilled test writers try to help us understand words or ideas, either by giving an example, or using paraphrase, so take the time to look for these clues. Look at the following example:</p>
<div class="callout callout-style-default callout-note callout-titled">
<div class="callout-header d-flex align-content-center">
<div class="callout-icon-container">
<i class="callout-icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="callout-title-container flex-fill">
Note
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Some people believe that parents should be responsible for teaching children right from wrong. Others think that schools should also teach children to behave well.</p>
<p>Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Some candidates might not know the phrase ‘<em>to teach right from wrong</em>’, so the second sentence paraphrases this idea with ‘<em>teaching children to behave well</em>’, helping to explain it. This is done deliberately at the test writing stage, so make sure we use all of the help that is there in the question.</p>
<div class="callout callout-style-default callout-tip callout-titled">
<div class="callout-header d-flex align-content-center">
<div class="callout-icon-container">
<i class="callout-icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="callout-title-container flex-fill">
Tip
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Don’t quickly skim read the question so that you can start writing as soon as possible. Take the time to read it carefully; identify the issue you must discuss and the argument you must respond to. Look for clues within the question to help you understand the meaning of key ideas.</p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<section id="solution-2-begin-with-a-general-statement" class="level3" data-number="1.1.6">
<h3 data-number="1.1.6" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="solution-2-begin-with-a-general-statement"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.6</span> Solution 2: Begin with a general statement</h3>
<p>Our first sentence should introduce the broad topic and thus set the context for our essay. Although this is quite a general statement, it should still be relevant to the question and to our argument.</p>
<p>Accurately identifying the general topic in the question is an important first step.</p>
</section>
<section id="problem-4---translating-the-words-in-the-question" class="level3" data-number="1.1.7">
<h3 data-number="1.1.7" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="problem-4---translating-the-words-in-the-question"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.7</span> Problem 4 - ‘Translating’ the words in the question</h3>
<p>Having set the overall context in our first sentence, the next sentence will introduce the reader to the issue that is going to be discussed. Many people already know that you should avoid copying directly from the question, but then go too far by substituting each word with a synonym.</p>
</section>
<section id="solution" class="level3" data-number="1.1.8">
<h3 data-number="1.1.8" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="solution"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.8</span> Solution</h3>
<p>Although it is true that we should not copy large parts of the question, this does not mean you have to avoid <strong>all</strong> of the words, which may have been used because they are the most appropriate or the most natural. For example, ‘<em>Some people</em>’ is the most natural way to talk about an anonymous group; we don’t use ‘<em>Numerous individuals</em>’ or ‘<em>humans</em>’, in the same way. Similarly, ‘<em>teachers</em>’ is a better word to use than ‘<em>educational scholars</em>’ and ‘<em>children</em>’ is more natural than ‘<em>youths</em>’.</p>
<p>Rather than translating the words in the question, aim to <em>interpret</em> the overall meaning as precisely as we can. It can sometimes help to change the statement we are given into a question. This has the additional advantage of making our task clearer.</p>

<p>Complete the following introduction to our essay question using these words and phrases</p>
<p>at school, grow up, discipline, teach</p>
<p>Discipline is an important part of growing up. Some people believe that children should <em>be taught</em> how to behave at school, while others think this is the job of their parents.</p>

<p>In sentence 1, the focus is not accurate - this is about famous people, not ambitious people. The general topic is not accurate (the topic is the impact that fame has)</p>
<p>In sentence 2, the general topic is not accurate: ‘eminent personalities’ is an attempt to translate the question using synonyms but ‘eminent’ people (people who are important in society) are not the focus of this essay.</p>
<p>Sentence 3 translates the words in the question into synonyms and also introduces the issue rather than the focus and general topic.</p>
<p>Sentence 4 is a good opening sentence - the focus and general topic are clear. As you will see later, the phrase ‘fascinates many people’ introduces a theme that will occur later in the essay. ## Paraphrasing</p>

<p>Solution</p>
<p>If you decide to include a thesis statement in your introduction, you need to:</p>
<p>be fully aware of your position and main argument before writing it</p>
<p>give only a brief overview of your thesis (in one sentence)</p>
<p>make sure your thesis accurately reflects the argument you will make in your body paragraphs</p>

<p>Some candidates finish their introduction with a sentence that paraphrases the final question in the writing task. For example, ‘<em>In this essay I will discuss these two views before giving my own opinion</em>’. This copy the words in the task almost exactly, which is not a good idea. Others draw attention to the writing process in a different way: ‘<em>I will now prove that…</em>’. Again, this is unnecessary - your examiners knows <strong>why</strong> you are writing; In our introduction, they just want to learn <strong>what</strong> you are writing about.</p>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>Don’t paraphrase the question itself, only focus on the topic and the issue that will be discussed. Aim to write in a less personal way - keep the focus on your essay, not on yourself as the writer. For example, it is better to write: ‘<em>This essay will discuss …</em>’ instead of ‘<em>In this essay I will discuss…</em>’</p>

<h1 data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> The body paragraph</h1>
<p>Your body paragraphs are made up of sentences that connect together to form one unit; each sentence is rather like a small building block that helps create one larger building block within your overall argument. The reader should be able to identify the central topic from your first and last sentences, and this same topic should be reflected in the sentences in between, which each serve to explain and support your main ideas.</p>

<p>Make sure to write at least two sentences in your conclusion. The first should summarise the main</p>
<p>ideas in your argument. To help with this, look back at the first and last sentences in each body</p>
<p>paragraph and summarise these. In your final sentence, make sure to answer the question you were</p>
<p>given. In other words, make it clear whether you believe the advantages outweigh the disadvantages;</p>
<p>whether this is a positive or a negative development; or the extent to which you agree or disagree etc.</p>
<p>The biggest problems I see in conclusions are:</p>
<p>conclusions that are too short (often one sentence only)</p>
<p>summarising only one idea rather than the main points in the argument</p>
<p>not answering the question (i.e.&nbsp;not saying to what extent you agree / disagree etc.)</p>
<p>introducing a new idea that has not been discussed or mentioned earlier</p>
<p>Words and phrases should use:</p>
<p><em>To sum up, ; In conclusion, ; Therefore, ; I completely agree / disagree ; In my view, etc</em></p>

<section id="progression-and-development-within-an-argument" class="level1" data-number="1">
<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Progression and development within an argument</h1>
<p>As we have seen, individual arguments are logically connected through meaning, the effective use of linking words and phrases, and referencing (using a synonym or pronoun). In an earlier example we looked at, one candidate wrote, ‘<em>On the societal level, <u>the results</u> may be catastrophic if this is the case</em>’. This argument can only show clear progression if the reader can easily understand what the terms ‘<em>if this is the case</em>’, and ‘<em>the results</em>’ refer to. If these ideas remain unclear, then the whole argument will also be unclear. Thus, problems with progression are often connected to problems with cohesive devices, and to referencing in particular. These issues need to be controlled <strong>throughout your essay</strong> to achieve band 7 or above.</p>
<p><img src="https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/writing-task-2-8/Pasted image 20250916181359.png" class="img-fluid"> # Addressing Coherence and cohesion problems</p>
<ul>
<li>Use cohesive devices effectively but cohesion between sentences is faulty</li>
<li>does not always use referencing clearly</li>
</ul>
<p>This paragraph shows mixed success in using cohesive devices. Here are some examples where these are managed well</p>

</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>Each of these examples is a clear signpost showing how two ideas are connected - this is what cohesion means. However, the use of referencing sometimes causes confusion, making it difficult to follow the ideas</p>

<p>Even though we have fixed the referencing problems, the second sentence in the final exercises shows a further common coherence problem at band 6.5: it contains too many different ideas and so it is difficult to follow</p>

<p>This often happens when candidates write overly long, complex sentences.</p>
<p>Rewrite this extract to make it clearer. Try to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>split it into 2 or 3 separate sentences</li>
<li>add a cohesive device to make the links clearer (e.g.&nbsp;a linking phrase and / or a reference)</li>
<li>add modal verbs (can, might, may) to make the statements more cautious and less certain (hedging language)</li>
</ul>
<p>While doing this, the students become curious and want to know more about these people. That thinking can encourage the children to emulate their qualities, which consequently become integrated into their own personality.</p>

<p>The examiner must be able to follow your reasoning to give you a score of band 7 or above, the more difficult this is to do, the lower your score. The language you use (referencing, modal verbs, the length of your sentences) can have an impact on the examiner’s ability to follow your argument and understand your conclusions.</p>

<p>Reading our writing out loud in can helps you to notice repetition more easily. Although we cannot do this in a test situation, practicing like this before our test should help us silently read over our work in a more focused way. We can make inner voice seem ‘louder’ when we want to do this type of final checking.</p>

<p>We have a method for writing a paragraph known as PEEL. The P refer to making a Point, which is then Explained, Expanded, then clearly Links back to the question. The Point and Link also act as a frame for the main idea within the paragraph, and these are a good way to ensure that we ‘present a clear central topic’ (Band 7) - provided, that these sentences accurately reflect the idea within the paragraph. Look at the first and last sentences in our updated paragraph. Do you think that these help to ‘present a clear central topic?’</p>

<p>Children spend the largest part of their day at school, where the teachers can cultivate their minds and fill them with knowledge that is not only important for their career, but that can also help them grow into wise adults. They can mentor the students in many different ways, for instance through books or group activities, where they can learn to tell right from wrong. In addition, children become engaged in various extra-curricular activities at school, where they are often asked to dress up like great leaders. While doing so, the students may become curious and want to know more about these people, which could encourage the children to emulate their qualities. These positive traits may even become integrated into their own personality. Therefore, the role of schools in instilling good behavior is much more crucial than that of the parent.</p>

<h3 data-number="1.2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-first-sentence"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> The first sentence</h3>
<p>The first sentence tells us that the central topic in this paragraph will be: ‘<em>school and teachers cultivating the minds of children to fill them with knowledge that is important for their career and helping them grow into wise adults.</em>’ This is too long and complex to be a helpful signpost for the reader, but it also isn’t accurate - the children’s careers are never mentioned again. This sentence would work better as a second sentence, which shows a common problem - the first sentence of the paragraph is missing. The writer’s overall argument in this paragraph seems to be that ‘<em>schools have a lot of influence on children’s behavior</em>’, so this idea would produce a much more appropriate first sentence.</p>

<h3 data-number="1.2.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-final-sentence"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.2</span> The final sentence</h3>
<p>In the final sentence, the writer makes a good attempt at linking this paragraph to the question. However, it claims that the paragraph shows that ‘<em>the role of schools in instilling good behavior is much more crucial than that of the parent</em>’. This conclusion is not supported by the evidence given here and so remains unclear - the role of parents is not mentioned at all. A more appropriate sentence would be: <em>Therefore, the role of schools in instilling good behavior is a significant one.</em> Revising the first and last sentence so that they accurately reflect the ideas in the paragraph will significantly improve the Coherence and cohesion score here.</p>

</ul>
<p>The argument being made in this paragraph is that ‘<em>schools have a lot of influence on children’s behavior</em>’. This is the main idea or conclusion that needs to be made clear. The ideas within the paragraph need to explain and support this point if we want to present an adequately developed response. Remember, these explanations must help the reader to understand <em>why</em> the writer believes this, and show that it is a valid argument or conclusion.</p>

</table>
<p>The explanation for the last idea (point 3) takes up almost half of the paragraph, yet the argument that children can permanently alter their personality and behavior by temporarily wearing different clothes still does not seem to be a valid one. In contrast, the ideas that are far more relevant to the main idea and the central topic (the role of the teacher in group activities and mentoring) are insufficiently developed or explained and so also remain unclear.</p>
<p>There is a further problem here. The writing task told us to discuss whether schools should be responsible for teaching good behavior, not just parents, but the writer has introduced a theme that is not relevant: children learning how to behave by copying famous leaders.</p>
<p>If the writer had applied critical thinking before writing he would have realized that this idea should be deleted. Instead, by persisting with it, and explaining it over several sentences, he has gradually moved further and further away from the issue in the question. This is what happens when you think as you write, and will occur no matter what your level is. As a result, even with the improvements we have made to language and Coherence and Cohesion, this paragraph still represents band 6 Task response, which helps explain why native speakers also struggle to score band 7 or above.</p>

<p>Schools have a great deal of influence on young children. From the age of five or six, children spend most of their day there, under the guidance of their teachers. Although we tend to think of education in terms of academic knowledge, this is only part of the picture. At school, children learn to make friends and to think independently. Through group activities, teachers can show them how to cooperate with others and play well together. Children quickly learn self-control, and realize that there is a right and wrong way to behave. In fact, if teacher did not correct poor behavior, the result would be a noisy disruptive classroom, where learning is almost impossible. Therefore, schools inevitably play a crucial role in shaping a child’s character.</p>

<p>Structure our paragraphs using <strong>PEEL</strong>. Begin by making a Point, which we then Explain, Expand, and then clearly Link our paragraph and argument back to the question.

<li>The first sentence in the paragraph introduces the main idea (the ‘central topic’ here is the influence that schools have on children). The final sentence reaches a conclusion based on the evidence provided within the paragraph, shows how this is linked to the question, and makes our position clear.</li>
<li>We can see P and L in PEEL as overall conclusions about the argument within the paragraph. The first introduces these through a general statement or point, and the final sentence sums up the main argument in the paragraph, and shows that it is answering the question - in other words, why or how this is relevant to the question we have been given.</li>
<li>Each idea between those sentence</li>

<p>When we can do something well, we can make it look easy. Do not underestimate the skill required to neatly sum up an argument or main point in this way - do not be fooled into thinking ‘the level here is too low because it is too easy to understand’. Those who believe this continue to write in a way that makes their central ideas, conclusions, and position unclear.</p>

<li>The grammatical points are not used to boost the Grammatical accuracy and range score but to make the position and argument clear. Each grammar point serves this purpose. Look back at sentence 2 and 3 to see the role that conparatives, and modal verbs play in making the writer’s position verb clear.</li>
<li>The vocabulary used also serves the same purpose. Compare sentence 1 to sentence 4. In sentence 1, the writer is focused on clearly communicating the message - ‘have a great deal of influence on’ conveys the message very clearly while also showing good collocation (i.e.&nbsp;uses the correct combination of words: _have an influence on__). In sentence 4, the writer may have intended to say, ‘<em>Schools have a lot of influence on young children</em>’, but in trying to score Lexical resource points by using ‘high level’ words instead, they lost the clarity that is needed to reach the higher bands.</li>

<p>Extra practice Go back over previous essays you have written and focus on your body paragraphs. • Look for any pronouns you have used - what do these refer back to? Is this reference clear? • Find the conclusions you made in each argument (your points and claims) and the reasons you gave for believing these (your supporting evidence) and decide if your arguments and conclusions are clear and valid. What changes can you make to help make them clearer? • Look back at the first sentence in each paragraph - does it introduce one clear central topic? • Do your final sentences accurately reflect the evidence you have provided and link back to the question - in other words, do your paragraphs match the PEEL structure? • Is one paragraph more successful at this than another? (This is a common problem and indicates insufficient planning before writing.)| • Rewrite one or two paragraphs for practice when you have time. Make a note of any repeated language problems and grammar points, and make sure to study and practise them. For example, relative clauses, conditional sentences, modal verbs.</p>

<h2 data-number="1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-a-counterargument"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> What is a counterargument?</h2>
<p>Imagine that we have a good job, and we may be promoted soon, but we have been offered a new job in a different country. Before reaching a decision, we would naturally think carefully about all sides of the issue. We would consider the benefits of staying in our current job, as well as the benefits of the new job. We would also consider the disadvantages of both ideas. If someone asked us, ‘<em>What did you decide to do?</em>’ We might say:</p>
<p>‘<em>I’m going to take the job because it’s a really good opportunity. I know you might think that I’ll miss out on getting a promotion, but the pay is better, and I think I’ll learn so much more if I go.</em>’</p>
<p>This speaker is showing that they reached a decision after considering all sides of the issue; they show this by:</p>
<div class="callout callout-style-default callout-note callout-titled">

<p>Presenting an argument: <font color="#245bdb">I’m going to take the new job because it’s a really good opportunity.</font></p>
<p>Acknowledging a counterargument: <font color="#d83931">I know you might think that I’ll miss out on getting a promotion.</font></p>
<p>Refuting* the counterargument: <font color="#245bdb">But the pay is better and I think I’ll learn so much more.</font></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Acknowledging the counterargument in this way makes the argument stronger than simply saying: ‘<em>I’ve decided to take the job because it’s a really good opportunity and I will learn a lot in the new job</em>.’ Notice also that, even though they have referred to the counterargument, we still know what this person’s position is - we still know what they have decided to do.</p>
<div class="callout callout-style-default callout-note callout-titled">

</div>
<div class="callout-title-container flex-fill">
Note
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>An argument is made stronger by not only presenting evidence to support our conclusions, but also by considering, and then refuting, the argument that is against, or ‘counter’, to it: the counterargument. Doing this shows that we considered all sides of the issues before reaching our conclusion.</p>

<h2 data-number="1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-is-this-relevant-to-ielts"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> How is this relevant to IELTS?</h2>
<p>The following examples help to see this analogy in terms of some typical writing task 2 questions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Some people think it is better to stay in the same job all your working life. To what extent do you agree or disagree?</li>
<li>Some people think it is better to stay in the same job all your life. Others think it is better to do different jobs throughout your career. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.</li>
<li>Nowadays, people change jobs more often than in the past. Is this a positive or a negative development?</li>
<li>People are now more likely to have several different jobs throughout their career than in the past. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?</li>
</ol>
<p>When responding to each on of these questions, we can present an argument for changing jobs, and discuss the counterargument - the argument for staying in the same job. With questions 2 to 4, we <strong>must</strong> respond by considering both of these sides. Only question 1 is different</p>
</section>
<section id="to-what-extent-do-you-agree-or-disagree-do-you-agree-or-disagree" class="level2" data-number="1.3">
<h2 data-number="1.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="to-what-extent-do-you-agree-or-disagree-do-you-agree-or-disagree"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> To what extent do you agree or disagree? Do you agree or disagree?</h2>
<p>Only with questions like this, and the General Training equivalent of ‘<em>Do you agree or disagree?</em>’, do we have a choice in the way we respond. With these questions, we can:</p>
<p>A. present an argument that looks at both sides, then reach a conclusion about it</p>
<p>B. present an argument for only the side we agree with</p>
<p>C. present an argument for only the side we agree with, while also mentioning, and refuting, the counterargument.</p>

<p>PC said that the approach A’s advantages outweigh the disadvantages, and can be easier to achieve with less practice.</p>

<h2 data-number="1.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-bad-advice-causes-problems"><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Why bad advice causes problems</h2>
<p>If you write, ‘<em>It is thought</em>’, or ‘<em>It is felt</em>’, then you are not telling the examiner that <u>you</u> think of feel. Similarly, as we will see, the advice to avoid using ‘some’ or ‘some people’ results in candidates presenting what should be a counterargument as though it is an argument they actually believe.</p>
<p>By far the easiest way to present a clear counterargument is to say, ‘<em>Some people may think XYZ, but I think ABC</em>’.</p>

<p>When answering, ‘<em>To what extent do you agree or disagree?</em>’ questions, we are often asked how or when to include a counterargument. The examples below show, very briefly, some different ways we can do this. These arguments that might be made in answer to our previous question:</p>

  <title>Writing Task 2 - Teaching cooking</title>
  <dc:creator>Hung </dc:creator>
  <link>https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/w2-food/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><em>Some people think that students should study the science of food and how to prepare it. Others believe students should spend time on more important subjects. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Some people argue that schools should teach children about food science and cooking, while others believe the curriculum should concentrate only on academic subjects. This essay will examine both perspective before explaining why I believe that teaching food science and cooking is the more beneficial approach.</p>
<p>On the one hand, those who prioritize academic subjects argue that focus on food science or cooking in school is a waste of valuable study time. This is because they suggest that students should devote their time to core academic subjects, such as mathematics and science, which are regarded as more important for future success. For instance, entry to prestigious universities usually depends on high grades in these subjects, rather than in cooking or food science. For this reason, they see little value including cooking or food science in the school curriculum.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is also believed that learning cooking and food science is essential for young people to become independent adults. In particular, understanding nutrition and learning to cook simple meals can help young people lead healthier lives. For example, students who know how to cook are less likely to rely on fast food when they live away from home. Furthermore, these skills allow them to enjoy a wider variety of meals and to manage their finances more effectively. In fact, students who cook their own meals often spend far less money than those who rely on restaurants or fast food. As a result, these skills prepare young people to live both more healthy and more economically when they become independent.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while some people think schools should focus only on academic subjects, others believe that cooking and food science are equally important. I agree with the latter view, as these skills not only promote healthier lifestyles but also help young people manage their finances and prepare for independent living.</p>

<p>You should spend about 40 minutes on this task.</p>
<p>Write about the following topic:</p>
<p><strong>Many people in poor countries die from diseases that are curable because they cannot afford the medication required.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you believe that drug companies should make their products available at reduced prices in these countries?</strong></p>
<p>Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge and experience.</p>
<p>Write at least 250 words.</p>

<p>treat to give medical care to someone</p>
<p>treatment medical care given to someone</p>
<p>vaccine a substance you put in your blood to protect the body from disease</p>
<p>Intro paraphrase the question:</p>
<p>Many people in developing nations die from diseases that could be cured, mainly because medicines are too expensive.</p>
<p>thesis:</p>
<p>While pharmaceutical companies need profit to fund research and development, I believe they should sell their products at reduced prices in poorer countries to reduce inequality and save lives.</p>
<p>Body 1 - drug companies’ side</p>
<p>How do drug companies make money? -&gt; by selling medicines at high prices.</p>
<p>Why are medicines expensive? -&gt; cost of research, clinical trials, and production.</p>
<p>Is this good? Yes, because without profit, they cannot innovate or create new treatments/vaccines.</p>
<p>Example: Development of vaccines (like for COVID-19) required huge investment and profit incentives.</p>
<p>Body 2 - Poor countries’ situation</p>
<p>Can everyone in poor countries afford medicine? No, many live below poverty line.</p>
<p>Why unfair? -&gt; creates inequality; curable disease continue to kill people</p>
<p>Who else can help? Governments, NGOs, international organizations (e.g.&nbsp;WHO) can subsidize or negotiate reduced prices.</p>
<p>Example: Some vaccine programs (e.g.&nbsp;polio immunization) were subsidized globally, saving millions of lives.</p>
<p>Conclusion Summarize: Drug companies must balance profit with responsibility.</p>
<p>Opinion: They should make medicines affordable in poor countries, possibly through reduced prices or subsidies, because human life is more valuable than profit.</p>
<p>Many people in developing nations die from diseases that could be cured, mainly because medicines are too expensive. While pharmaceutical companies need profit to fund research and development, I believe they should sell their products at reduced prices in poorer countries to reduce inequality and save lives.</p>
<p>On the one hand, drug companies argue that their products are expensive because it need enormous resources to make. They must invest large amount of money on development process, such as research, clinical trials, vaccines, which can need several millions dollar and decades to success. Without profit, they would not be able to innovate or develop new treatments, enhance drugs. For example, the development of vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic cost billions of dollars, and only strong profits made this possible. Therefore, it is understandable that pharmaceutical companies charge high prices in order to recover their investment and continue developing new treatments.</p>
<p>On the other hand, people in poor countries often live below the poverty line, so some drugs have normal price in developed countries but cost a fortune of people in developing countries. This situation creates inequality because curable disease still kill people or destroy their family financial, making their future more hardly. In my opinion, drug companies can should reduce prices or allow governments and charities to subsidize treatments. A good example is the global campaign to immunize children against polio, where vaccines were provided a little or no cost, saving millions of lives. This shows that cooperation and reduced pricing can treat diseases effectively in poorer regions.</p>
<p>In conclusion, although drug companies must make a profit in order to fund research and the development of new medicines, I believe they also have an ethical duty to make essential treatments affordable in poorer countries. By reducing prices or cooperating with international organisations, they can continue to benefit financially while helping to reduce global inequality and save lives.</p>

  <title>Writing task 2 - International / local charity</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Some people think that charity organizations should only offer help to people of their own country. But others believe that these organizations should give aid to people in great need wherever they live. Discuss both views and give your opinion.</p>
<hr>
<p>Charitable organizations play an important role in supporting those in need, but there is debate about whether their assistance should be limited to people in their own country or extended across borders. While some argue that national responsibility must come first, others believe that aid should be based on human need rather than geography.</p>
<p>There is debate about whether charity organizations should limit their assistance to people in their own country or provide help to those in need regardless of location. While both sides present convincing arguments, I believe charities should not restrict their efforts by national borders.</p>
<p>There is ongoing debate about whether charity organizations should focus only on supporting people in their own country or whether they should extend their help to those in need abroad. While both perspectives have strong arguments, I believe the most effective approach is to provide assistance wherever it is most urgently required.</p>
<p>One reason some people argue that charities should concentrate on their own citizens is the issue of limited resources. Most charities depend on donations, which are rarely enough to address every problem. By focusing on national issues such as poverty, homelessness, or healthcare, these organizations can ensure that urgent needs at home are met. Furthermore, donors may feel more motivated to contribute if they know their money directly benefits their local community, which strengthens long-term support for these charities.</p>
<p>On the other hand, many believe that charity should not be restricted by geography. Natural disasters, famine, or war can create crises where entire populations are at risk, and local governments may lack the capacity to cope. In such circumstances, international charities are often the only organizations able to deliver essential aid like food, medicine, and shelter. Moreover, in today’s interconnected world, problems in one country - such as pandemics or climate change - can easily affect others, making international assistance not only compassions but also practical.</p>
<p>In my view, although it is reasonable for charities to prioritize local issues, they should not limit themselves entirely to national concerns. A balanced approach is most effective: dedicating part of their resources to domestic needs while also responding to international emergencies ensures that help reaches people in the greatest need, regardless of where they live.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while there are clear benefits to focusing on domestic problems, there also compelling reasons for providing international aid. Therefore, I believe charities should aim to strike a balance between supporting their local communities and offering help to people overseas who are facing severe hardship.</p>

  <title>Writing task 2 - International air travel</title>
  <dc:creator>Hung </dc:creator>
  <link>https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/w2-air-travel/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>International air travel has a negative impact upon the environment and should therefore be restricted. Do you agree or disagree?</p>
<hr>
<p>In recent years, some argue that international air travel should be curtailed due to its detrimental effect on the environment. However, I totally disagree with this idea, as restricting global flights would not only hinder economic growth but also undermine culture exchange.</p>
<p>On the economic front, air transport plays a pivotal role in facilitating tourism and trade, which are indispensable drivers of prosperity. For example, nations such as Thailand or Spain rely heavily on international visitors, and limiting flights would deal a severe blow to their hospitality industries. Moreover, multinational companies depend on global mobility to conduct business, attend meetings, and negotiate contracts. Without air travel, the interconnected nature of the global economy would collapse, creating ripple effects on employment and living standards worldwide.</p>
<p>Equally important is the cultural dimension. Air travel allows people from different continents to meet, share, and foster mutual understanding. This cross-cultural interaction broadens people’s horizons and reduces prejudices, ultimately paving the way for a more harmonious world. If flights were restricted, such opportunities would vanish, leaving societies increasingly insular and intolerant. Although environmental concerns are legitimate, governments should prioritize sustainable aviation technologies such as biofuels and carbon offsetting instead of imposing blanket restrictions on flights.</p>
<p>In conclusion, restricting international air travel would do more harm than good, as it would jeopardize both global economies and cultural connectivity.</p>
<hr>
<p>It is argued that international air travel damages the environment and should therefore be reduced. Although air transport is a source of pollution, I completely disagree that restricting flights is the right solution. This is because global mobility is essential in today’s world, and alternative measures can address the environmental challenges more effectively.</p>
<p>Firstly, limiting international flights would create serious social and economic problems. Air travel allows people to study abroad, expand businesses, and maintain international relationships. Restricting this freedom would not only harm global trade and tourism but also prevent cultural exchange and educational opportunities. For instance, many students depend on international flights to pursue higher education in other countries, which would be impossible if travel were severely limited. Therefore, placing restrictions would have far-reaching negative consequences.</p>
<p>Secondly, environmental issues caused by aviation can be addressed without banning or restricting flights. Governments and airlines are already investing in cleaner technology, such as more fuel-efficient engines and the development of sustainable aviation fuels. In addition, policies such as carbon offsetting and taxes on luxury or frequent travel can encourage responsible flying while still keeping it accessible. These strategies show that it is possible to reduce emissions without restricting international movement.</p>
<p>In conclusion, although air travel contributes to environmental problems, restricting it would cause more harm than good. A better solution is to continue supporting technological improvements and policies that make aviation more sustainable, while still allowing people to enjoy the benefits of international mobility.</p>

  <title>How to Structure a ‘Two Question’ Essay</title>
  <dc:creator>Hung </dc:creator>
  <link>https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/two-question-essay/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Let’s look at an example of this kind of question:</p>
<pre><code>*Nowadays governments are investing more in public transport such as buses and trains rather than in building new roads.*
*What are the reasons for this?*
*Is this a positive or negative development?*</code></pre>
<section id="clear-position" class="level1">
<h1>Clear position</h1>
<p>For this kind of task we need to discuss both questions. In the first question, we are given a situation and asked to explain why. The second question requires a clear opinion so <strong>we must choose a side.</strong> This is very important for our task response score. If we don’t choose a side and support that ‘position’ clearly, we will lose marks for our task response. We will get a maximum of 5 for task achievement if we do not choose a side.</p>
<p>It’s not important which side we choose as long as we choose one. Here are the options for the second questions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Agree</strong>: We think it’s a positive development that governments are spending more money on public transport. We support this opinion.</li>
<li><strong>Disagree:</strong> We think it’s a negative development that governments are spending more money on public transport. We support this opinion.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="clear-essay-structure" class="level1">
<h1>Clear essay structure</h1>
<p>David Lang recommend that we should give our opinion in the introduction as well as the conclusion (for all IELTS Task 2 questions). It’s OK to write a very general introduction and leave our opinion to the end. But it’s not as clear and we might run out of time before we’ve hot to our conclusion, so overall it’s a risky strategy. If we don’t choose a side and support that ‘position’ clearly, we will lose marks for our task response.</p>
<p>Therefore, him suggested essay structure is four paragraphs. The opinion is presented in the introduction and re-stated in the conclusion. Ideally each body paragraph in the introduction and re-stated in the conclusion.</p>
</section>
<section id="possible-essay-structures" class="level1">
<h1>Possible Essay structures</h1>
<p><strong>1. Agree</strong> - we feel it’s a positive development that governments are spending more money on public transport.</p>
<p>We need at least <strong>one good reason</strong> why it’s happening and <strong>one good reason</strong> why it’s a positive development.</p>
<table class="caption-top table">

  <title>Performance-Enhancing Drugs in Sports</title>
  <dc:creator>Hung </dc:creator>
  <link>https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/performance-enhancing-drug/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><em>In recent years, there has been a rise in the use of performance-enhancing substances in sports.</em> <em>What are the consequences of doping for athletes?</em> <em>What measures should be taken to combat this issue?</em></p>
<p>There has been a considerable rise in detections for performance-enhancing substances in athletic competitions recently. In my opinion, the most likely consequences for athletes concern their careers and this infraction is best tackled through more sophisticated screening tests.</p>
<p>In the majority of cases, athletes risk lasting career repercussions when caught doping. The first and most obvious consequences are financial. An athlete who tests positive for a banned substance will certainly be banned for a defined amount of time, potentially permanently in serious cases, and will forfeit salary and prize money over this period. Beyond raw salary, most athletes receive endorsements and a worsening public image will undoubtedly damage those business relationships as well. Relatedly, an athlete’s legacy is also at stake. A well-known example of this would be the baseball player Barry Bonds who not only lost the final years of an illustrious career to suspensions but has also not been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame due to his past transgressions and numerous failed tests.</p>
<p>In order to combat the pervasiveness of performance-enhancing drugs, sporting authorities must invest in modernized testing procedures. The most complex testing is currently utilized in the Olympics, however there are flaws in this system as it is often compromised by corruption and the equally sophisticated doping methods of certain nations. A more pertinent case of study would be in sports such as boxing and MMA where testing can literally mean the difference between life and death. In boxing, athletes often agree to their own testing procedures contractually. This method is inferior to vesting power in an authority, such as the UFC, that can ensure tests are modern and fairly conducted. Most UFC athletes are tested at random points throughout the year as well as prior to and immediately after bouts. Applying such a policy across various sports would not only catch the bast majority of infractions but also, more importantly, deter abuse even beginning.</p>
<p>In conclusion, athletes risk reputational and financial damage by doping and this can be prevented as testing becomes more comprehensive and potent. These measures are necessary to safeguard the integrity of sporting competitions around the world.</p>
<hr>
<p>In recent years, the use of performance-enhancing drugs in sports has increased, posing significant challenges to fair competition. Doping not only harm an athlete’s career and finances but also damages the trust between fans, sponsors, and sporting institutions. I firmly believe that to protect the integrity of sports, it is essential to implement more advanced and transparent testing procedures.</p>
<p>Athletes who resort to doping face serious long-term consequences that extend beyond temporary suspensions. When an athletes tests positive for banned substances, they risk losing salaries, prize money, and lucrative endorsements. For example, a renowned baseball player might be suspended, causing them to forfeit not only their immediate earnings but also potential future opportunities, such as Hall of Fame induction. This example clearly shows that doping can irreversibly tarnish an athlete’s legacy and career, leading to both financial ruin and a permanent stain on their reputation.</p>
<p>To effectively counter the issue of doping, sports authorities must adopt modern, comprehensive testing protocols. While major competitions like the Olympics employ advanced testing, the current is sometimes undermined by corruption and the ever-evolving sophistication of doping techniques. In sports like boxing and mixed martial arts, for instance, some athletes are subjected to self-regulated tests and lack objectivity. In contrast, organizations such as the UFC implement rigorous, random testing both before and after events, ensuring a fairer system. Adopting these strict measures across all sports would not only detect infractions more reliably but also serve as a strong deterrent against doping. By ensuring that testing is both modern and impartial, the integrity of competitive sports can be maintained, safeguarding athletes’ careers and reputation of the sport.</p>
<p>In conclusion, doping leads to severe financial and reputational damage for athletes while undermining the fairness of sports competitions. Only through the implementation of advanced, transparent testing procedures can we hope to deter doping and preserve the true spirit of sportsmanship for future generations.</p>

  <title>Health Services</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><em>Health services are a basic necessity. However, private companies have made them quite costly for ordinary individuals</em> <em>Do the advantages of private health care outweigh its disadvantage</em></p>
<section id="analysis" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>Advantages of Private Health Care: - Efficiency and shorter Waiting Times: Private hospitals offer quicker services compare to public hospitals, where long waiting lists are common. - Better facilities and advanced technology: Many private health institution provide cutting-edge medical technology, specialized treatments, and higher standards of care. - Greater Patient Choice: Individuals can select their preferred doctors, hospitals, and treatment plans, leading to more personalized care. Disadvantages of Private Health Care: - High costs and Limited Accessibility: Private health care is expensive, making it inaccessible for low-income individuals who cannot afford quality treatment. - Profit-driven System: The focus on profit can sometimes lead to unnecessary medical procedures, overcharging, or prioritizing financial gain over patient well-being. - Health inequality: A reliance on private health care can widen the gap between the rich and the poor, as only those who can afford it receive top-tier medical services. ## Sample essay Health care is an essential service, yet private medical facilities often make it unaffordable for many individuals. While private health care offers significant advantages such as efficiency, superior technology, and greater patient choice, it also has considerable drawbacks, particularly its high costs and contribution to social inequality. In my view, although private health care enhances medical standards, its disadvantages outweigh its benefits due to its exclusive and financial burden on ordinary citizens.</p>
<p>One of the key benefits of private health care is it efficiency. Unlike public hospitals, which often suffer from overcrowding and long waiting times, private institutions provide quicker access to medical attention. This is particularly crucial for emergency treatments or specialized procedures that require immediate intervention. Additionally, private hospitals invest heavily in advanced medical technology and modern infrastructure, ensuring high-quality treatment and specialized care. For instance, many private institutions offer robotic surgeries and personalized cancer treatments, which are not always available in public hospitals. Furthermore, private health care allows patients to choose their doctors and treatment plans, leading to a more personalized and comfortable experience.</p>
<p>However, the drawbacks of private health care are significant. The most pressing concern is its exorbitant cost, making it unaffordable for a large portion of the population. Many life-saving procedures and medications are out of reach for lower-income individuals, forcing them to rely on overstretched public health systems. Furthermore, because private hospitals overate on a profit-driven model, there is a risk of unnecessary procedures being performed to maximize revenue, sometimes at the expensive of patient welfare. Lastly, the presence of an expensive private health care sector creates a divide between the wealthy and the poor, exacerbating health inequalities. In countries without strong public health care, the underprivileged often suffer from preventable diseases simply due to financial constraints.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while private health care provides high-quality services and efficiency, its high costs and potential for exploitation make it a less viable option for the general population. A well-functioning public health system remains crucial to ensuring that medical care is accessible to all, regardless of financial status. Governments should regulate private health care costs and prioritize investment in public health services to balance quality with accessibility.</p>

<h1>David Lang’s essay</h1>
<p>Today, the cost of basic health services due to privatization has risen dramatically. In my opinion, although this can lead to greater innovation in the medical field, it is a negative burden overall for the average person.</p>
<p>Those who argue in favor of private medical care point out the benefits for medical knowledge generally. There is significant evidence in a wide range of industries as to the efficacy of privatization in driving innovation. The medical field i no different as hospitals in countries such as United States compete to develop innovative therapies and procedures that can enhance their reputations and generate higher revenues. These efforts in turn encourage the hiring of the brightest medical minds in the world. Without such competition, it is unlikely that many current advances in medical technology would exist at all.</p>
<p>However, these advances do little do alleviate the dramatic financial repercussions for ordinary citizens. In the United States, a person without medical insurance is likely to owe at least thousands for relatively simple procedure. Contrast this approach with many western European nations that function on a socialized approach to medicine. In these countries, a person is comforted by the knowledge that a trip to the hospital or consultation with a doctor will be largely paid for by the government. The result of this more equal system is that there is little disparity in the care given to the wealthy and less affluent segments of population.</p>
<p>In conclusion, despite the value of stimulating competition among medical institutions, there would be greater impact in a scheme wherein the individual could receive medical care without incurring excessive expenses. In many countries, this is already the situation.</p>

  <title>IELTS Writing Task 2 - Topic Sentences – The Fastest Way to Improve your Score</title>
  <dc:creator>Hung </dc:creator>
  <link>https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/english-topic-sentence/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<section id="what-are-topic-sentence" class="level1">
<h1>What are topic sentence ?</h1>
<p>The standard essay structure for a IELTS Task 2 essay is four paragraphs - an introduction, two body paragraphs and a conclusion.</p>
<p>The topic sentence is the first sentence of each body paragraph. It tells the examiner the main idea of the paragraph so it functions like a mini introduction.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-are-topic-sentences-important" class="level1">
<h1>Why are Topic Sentences Important?</h1>
<p>Good topic sentences help to make our paragraphs clear and easy to read.</p>
<p>As we can see from the table below, clear paragraphs really help our coherence and cohesion score.</p>

<section id="how-to-write-a-good-topic-sentence" class="level1">
<h1>How to Write a Good Topic Sentence ?</h1>
<p>A good topic sentence should be clear and simple.</p>
<p>A basic topic sentence has two parts: 1. The topic. 2. The reason / main idea. ![[18920776_935567866585887_4103732896360495495_o-768x575.jpg]]</p>
<p><strong>Example Question</strong></p>
<pre><code>Global warming/Climate change are pressing problems that every country and the world will have to deal with in the future.
What are the causes of global warming ?
What are some possible solutions ?</code></pre>
<p><strong>Body paragraph 1 (the main cause of global warming)</strong> Topic: the main cause of global warming Reason/ main idea: mass consumption of fossil fuels</p>
<p>So the topic sentence is: The main cause of climate change is the mass consumption of fossil fuels.</p>
<p><strong>Body paragraph 2 (a possible solution)</strong></p>
<p>Topic: one possible solution for dealing with global warming Reason/main idea: higher taxes on automobiles</p>
<p>The topic sentence is: One possible solution for dealing with climate change could be higher taxes on automobiles.</p>
</section>
<section id="topic-sentence-will-help-us-to-stay-married-to-one-main-idea." class="level1">
<h1>Topic sentence will help us to stay married to one main idea.</h1>
<p>As we saw in the table above, we should “present a clear central topic within each paragraph”. This means each body paragraph should be focused on just one main idea.</p>
<p>Therefore planning for our topic sentences helps us to decide what is the main idea for that paragraph.</p>
<p>After that we should ONLY think of support for that idea. We are married to that main idea. We can’t cheat on it with another main idea.</p>
<p>So for the following topic sentence, we should only discuss the mass consumption of fuels.</p>
<pre><code>The main cause of climate change is the mass consumption of fossil fuels.</code></pre>
<p>Some students spend nearly the whole paragraph discussing one main idea. But then near the end, they seem to panic or get overexcited, and suddenly add a second unrelated idea e.g.&nbsp;deforestation or methane emissions from animals. This is a very common mistake but as the table above showed this will lower our coherence and cohesion score. Remember each paragraph can only have “one central topic”. As part of our planning stage in the task 2 writing exam, we should write down our topic sentences. This will make it easier when we start writing our essay to keep our supporting ideas clear, and focused on our main idea. If we accidentally include a second main idea at the end - cross it out. Stay focused.</p>

  <title>Zoos</title>
  <dc:creator>Hung </dc:creator>
  <link>https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/english-writting-zoos/zoos.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><em>Zoos have long been a subject of debate. While some people argue that zoos play a crucial role in conserving endangered species and educating the public about wildlife, others contend that confining animals to artificial environments is unethical. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.</em></p>
<section id="analysis" class="level1">
<h1>Analysis</h1>
<p>Advantage: pros: Conservation zoos often participate in breeding programs and reintroduction efforts for endangered species. Education: They provide a unique opportunity for the public to learn about wildlife and environmental issues. Research: Zoos support scientific research and rehabilitation programs that can benefit species survival</p>
<p>Disadvantage Cons: Ethical concerns: Confining animals can lead to physical and psychological stress, raising serious animal welfare issues. Natural Behavior: The artificial habitats in zoos may prevent animals from expressing their natural behaviors, potentially leading to a diminished quality of life.</p>
</section>
<section id="sample" class="level1">
<h1>Sample</h1>
<p>In recent years, zoos have become a focal point of heated debate. On the one hand, proponents argue that zoos are indispensable for conserving endangered species and educating the public. On the other hand, critics maintain that confining animals to unnatural settings is inherently unethical. In my view, while the welfare of captive animals must be a priority, the benefits of well-managed zoos in conservation and education are substantial.</p>
<p>Supporters of zoos highlight their critical role in preserving biodiversity. With numerous species facing extinction, zoos provide a controlled environment where endangered animals can be bred and nurtured away from the threats of habitat loss and poaching. Many institutions have pioneered successful breeding programs, subsequently reintroducing species into the wild. Moreover, zoos serve as a vital educational platform, offering visitors first-hand exposure to wildlife. This experience not only fosters environmental awareness but also inspires future generations to engage in conservation efforts. Additionally, ongoing research in these settings has led to significant advancements in veterinary medicine and species rehabilitation.</p>
<p>Conversely, opponents argue that the confinement of animals infringes on their natural rights. Critics assert that even the most well-intentioned zoos cannot replicate the complex ecosystems that wild animals depend on, often leading to behavioral and psychological issues. The ethical debate is further intensified by instances of inadequate care and substandard living conditions in some facilities. While these concerns are valid, they underscore the need for stringent regulations rather than the outright dismissal of zoos as an institution.</p>
<p>In conclusion, although the ethical implications of captivity are significant, I believe that the conservation, education, and research benefits provided by zoos justify their existence - provided that animal welfare is rigorously safeguarded. This balanced approach can ensure that zoos continue to contribute positively to both wildlife preservation and public understanding of environmental issues.</p>

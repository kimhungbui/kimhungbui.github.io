  <title>Agriculture</title>
  <dc:creator>Hung </dc:creator>
  <link>https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/essay-agriculture/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In spite of the advances made in agriculture, many people around the world still go hungry. Why is this the case? What can be done about this problem? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own experience or knowledge. Write at least 250 words.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Recent years have witnessed tremendous developments in agricultural science yet every day people all over the world continue to suffer and even die from hunger. In my opinion, this is because innovations rarely impact the developing world and the best solution for it is to direct humanitarian funding towards these advances.</p>
<p>The main cause of more advanced agricultural methods not reaching the people who need it the most is that the developing world has trouble implementing these methods. There are a number of reasons for this ranging from limited financial resources to poor existing infrastructure to political instability, depending on the country in question. One example of this would be in many African nations, where malnourishment has historically been highest. Countries like the Congo have seen revolution after revolution over the last several decades, which has effectively destabilized the entire country. The universities where students would learn about changes in agriculture are frequently shut down or destroyed. The young people who would become agricultural scientists end up drawn into the conflict as soldiers or victims. Long-term economic neglect means that the government has very limited ability to subsidies farming. These problems are present to varying degrees in countries around the world and offer one possible explanation for the continued prevalence of hunger.</p>
<p>The solution that I believe would be most effective is directing humanitarian funds previously focused on food aid towards education and agriculture. Food aid is a notoriously poor solution because it only offers an immediate solution and warlords often exploit it to support their continued mistreatment of their people. It hurts more than it helps. However, there would be better long-term effects if international organizations and governments redirects that money into helping build better farms, provide more modern equipment, and sending qualified professions to train people in need. There is a TedTalk by a young man in Kenya who built his own windmill out of old bicycle parts and reading a book in the local library. It is large enough to power irrigation channels for the entire village. If more people like him can be found or trained when this will have an impact that lasts for decades and is relatively impervious to the factors preventing agricultural advances from taking root in developing countries.</p>
<p>In conclusion, developing companies face myriad problems that hinder their ability to take advantage of newer agricultural models and we should direct more funding to helping these countries learn more about new farming methods. This is likely to be an important issue in the world as the gap between rich and poor, developed and undeveloped widens while technological progress continues its indifferent march forward.</p>

  <title>IELTS Cambridge 16 Essay - Driverless Vehicles</title>
  <dc:creator>Hung </dc:creator>
  <link>https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/driverless-vehicles/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><strong>In the future all cars, buses and trucks will be driverless. The only people travelling inside these vehicles will be passengers.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you think the advantages of driverless vehicles outweigh the disadvantages?</strong></p>
<p>A future filled with driverless vehicles is an inevitability. In my opinion, though there are concomitant moral risks, the practical import for health such a seismic shift will be positive on the whole.</p>
<p>Critics of this trend suggest that machines should not be responsible for the potential loss of human life. This argument rests on the fact when there is an accident involving humans, it is possible to either assess blame and assign punishment or accept that human error played a role. In contrast, an individual severely injured as the result of a collision caused by a machine may justly feel that all human autonomy and free will is absent from their fate. This is analogous to a natural disaster with the crucial distinction being that humanity has engineered the situation. It is human nature to prefer to control a situation rather than surrender the outcome to an autonomous machine.</p>
<p>Proponents of automated vehicles, on the other hand, argue the tangible ramifications concerning public safety. The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that driverless vehicles cause fewer accidents than humans. The reason for this is that humans are prone to errors related to fatigue, distractions such as smartphones, and, in some cases, altered states. Machines might experience the occasional technical error, however, they are far more consistent by comparison. In fact, the few accidents that have occurred with automated vehicles were the fault of human drivers. If all cars were driverless, this would enabled a greater</p>
<hr>
<p>In the coming years, it is predicted that all vehicles, including cars, buses, and trucks, will operate autonomously without human drivers. While this development may raise some concerns, I firmly believe that the advantages of driverless transportation far outweigh the disadvantages.</p>
<p>One major advantage of autonomous vehicles is improved road safety. The majority of traffic accidents today are caused by human error, including distracted driving, fatigue, and impaired judgment. Driverless vehicles, on the other hand, rely on advanced sensors, algorithms, and machine learning, which allow them to make precise decisions and maintain constant awareness of their surroundings, can process vast amount of data in real time and react faster than any human driver. This can greatly reduce accidents, save lives, and lower the burden on healthcare systems. In addition, driverless technology could improve traffic flow and reduce congestion by enabling vehicles to communicate and coordinate more efficiency.</p>
<p>However, this transformation is not without drawbacks. A major concern is job loss among professional drivers, including taxi drivers, truckers, and bus operators. The widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles could lead to large-scale unemployment in these sectors. Moreover, ethical challenges arise in situations where a vehicle must choose between two harmful outcomes, raising questions about how machines should be programmed to make such decisions.</p>
<p>Despite these issues, I believe that the long-term benefits are more compelling. The reduction in traffic accidents, the potential for greater mobility for elderly and disabled individuals, and the increase in productivity for commuters are all powerful advantages. With proactive government policies, including retraining programs and strong ethical guidelines for AI systems, the negative impacts can be mitigated.</p>
<p>In conclusion, although there are valid concerns about the rise of driverless vehicles, particularly regarding employment and ethics, the positive impacts on safety, efficiency, and accessibility make this a highly promising development. Therefore, I believe the advantages clearly outweight the disadvantages.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><img src="https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/line-chart-social-center/Pasted image 20250602163817.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>David Lang essay:</p>
<p>The line chart details participants according to activity at a social center in the Australian city of Melbourne from 2000 to 2020. Looking from an overall perspective, it is readily apparent that participants for all activities increased to varying degrees except in terms of martial arts and amateur drama. Film club was by far the most popular activity throughout, though table tennis demonstrated the strongest growth.</p>
<p>In 2000, 64 individuals participated in the film club, a figure that dipped to 60 in 2010 and then more than recovered to finish the period at 65. The trend for martial arts was similarly stable with a beginning data point of 38, a high of 39 in 2010, and a final figure of 37.</p>
<p>The remaining activities started the period lower with 27 participants for amateur drama, 18 for table tennis, and 0 for musical performances (unavailable at the time). Over the next 10 years, amateur dramatics commenced a decline that would end at just 5 by 2020, while table tennis underwent the inverse transformation, peaking at 52 by the same year. Musical performances were only an option starting in 2005, with participants growing and leveling off to just under 20 by the end of the period.</p>

  <title>Task 1 Recycle paper</title>
  <dc:creator>Hung </dc:creator>
  <link>https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/english-recycle-paper/</link>

<p>David Lang</p>
<p>The diagram details how recycled paper is made. Looking from an overall perspective, it is readily apparent that the process involves three main stages beginning with initial collection and transportation, followed by cleaning and processing, and lastly the rolling of the final product. The process is entirely man-made.</p>
<p>In order to produce recycled paper, used paper is first sourced and transported by conveyor belt to a processing plant. The used paper is then made into unfiltered pulp by using water and various chemicals. The pulp must then be filtered with water being removed.</p>
<p>After filtering is complete, the filtered paper pulp is sent by a tube to a container with water and soap to be further cleaned. Air is pumped into the container and ink is removed. There is then an additional cleaning with water and chemicals before the final rolling states commence. To create useable recycled paper rolls, the cleaned and filtered pulp is placed on a conveyor belt where heated rollers flatten the paper and remove excess water.</p>
<p>Chat GPT</p>
<ul>
<li>Overall process: cyclical but shown in a linear step-by-step format.</li>
<li>Number of stages: 4 main stages - making pulp, filtering, cleaning, and making paper.</li>
<li>Raw material: Used paper.</li>
<li>End product: Recycled paper rolls.</li>
<li>Materials/chemicals used: Water</li>

<li>Used paper transported on a conveyor belt.</li>
<li>Mixed with water and chemicals - pulp.</li>
<li>Filtered to remove larger impurities.</li>
<li>Cleaned using soap, air, water -&gt; removes ink.</li>
<li>Final cleaned pulp used to make paper -&gt; heated rollers + drying.</li>
</ol>
<p>Useful vocab: - Recycled materials - Industrial process - Mechanical separation - De-inking - Environmental sustainability</p>
<p>The diagram illustrates the step-by-step process involved in the production of recycled paper from used paper materials. The procedure consists of four main stages, starting with the creation of pulp and culminating in the manufacture of new paper rolls.</p>
<p>In the first stage, used paper is placed on a conveyor belt and carried to a machine where it is mixed with water and chemicals. This mixture breaks the paper down into unfiltered pulp. The pulp then moves to the next stage where is it filtered. This step removes large unwanted materials, leaving behind filtered pulp.</p>
<p>In the third stage, the filtered pulp is cleaned using water, soap, and air. This helps separate and remove ink from the pulp. Water and additional chemicals are also added to enhance the cleaning process. As a result, the pulp becomes cleaner and suitable for making new paper.</p>
<p>Finally, the cleaned pulp is transferred onto a conveyor belt and passed through heated rollers. These rollers press and dry the material, forming sheets of recycled paper, which are then rolled up for reuse.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li><p>How are environmental problems dealt with in your country? In my country, environmental issues are taken seriously, but there’s still a long way to go. The government has made some rules about pollution and waste, and there are programs to plant more trees. But I think sometimes the laws are not enforced strictly, and people still throw garbage in the wrong places. In my country, environmental problems are addressed through a combination of legislation and public awareness campaigns. For instance, the government has introduced stricter regulations on industrial emissions and waste disposal. However, enforcement remains inconsistent, and public participation <strong>is not as widespread as it could be</strong>, which limits the overall effectiveness of these measures.</p></li>
<li><p>What can be done to make people recycle more often? I think if people know more about the benefits of recycling, they might do it more. Also, the government can give rewards or discounts to people who recycle. Putting more recycling bins around cities would help too. To encourage more frequent recycling, a combination of education and incentives could be effective. Public awareness campaigns can highlight the environmental and economic benefits of recycling, while practical steps- like providing more accessible recycling bins and offering financial incentives - can make the habit easier to adopt. Legislation that mandates in households and businesses could also play a significant role.</p></li>
<li><p>What is the most pressing environmental problem? In my opinion, the biggest problem is air pollution, especially in big cities. The air quality is really bad because of cars and factories. It affects people’s health, and it’s hard to fix quickly. Arguably, climate change is the most urgent environmental issue we face today. It not only exacerbates other problems like extreme weather and rising sea levels but also poses serious threats to biodiversity and food security. While localized issues like air pollution are severe, climate change has a truly global impact that requires immediate and coordinated action.</p></li>
<li><p>Is recycling a common practice in your country? Recycling is becoming more common, but it’s not something everyone does. Some people separate their trash at home, but many still throw everything together. It depends a lot on where you live - cities usually have more systems in place. Recycling is practiced in many parts of the country, particularly in urban areas where infrastructure is more developed. However, it’s far from universal. While some individuals and communities are highly conscientious, others lack access to proper facilities or are simply unaware of how to recycle effectively. So, it’s growing, but still inconsistent.</p></li>
<li><p>Are governments or individuals more responsible? I think both are responsible. The government needs to make good rules and make people follow the, but individuals also need to care about the environment and take action. It’s a shared responsibility. While both governents and individuals play vital roles, I believe governents bear greater responsibility due to their ability to enact policies, regulate industries, and invest in sustainable infrastructure. That said, individual behavior is equally crucial, as collective action often stes fro personal choices. Ideally, both should work hand in hand to address environental issues effectively.</p></li>

  <title>Transitive Verb an Intransitive Verb</title>
  <dc:creator>Hung </dc:creator>
  <link>https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/transitive-verb/transitive verbs.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>A transitive verb is a verb that requires an object to receive the action.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[!Example] Example Correct: The speaker <strong>discussed</strong> <em>different marketing strategies</em> in the video. Incorrect: The speaker <strong>discussed</strong> in the video. The verb “discuss” requires an object (“different marketing strategies”). It is necessary to state that the speaker discussed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Example Sentences:</strong></p>
<p>Some other examples of transitive verbs are “address,” “borrow,” “bring,” “discuss,” “raise,” “offer,” “pay,” “write,” “promise,” and “have.”</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The instructor <strong>addressed</strong> <em>the student’s</em> question.</p></li>
<li><p>Miriam <strong>borrowed</strong> <em>the methodology book</em> from her classmate because she forgot her copy.</p></li>
<li><p>Can you <strong>bring</strong> <em>your copy of the textbook</em> to our study group meeting?</p></li>
<li><p>The committee members <strong>will raise</strong> <em>money</em> for the new project.</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="direct-and-indirect-objects" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="direct-and-indirect-objects">Direct and Indirect Objects</h2>
<p>A transitive verb can take more than one object.</p>
<ul>
<li>Donovan <strong>gave</strong> <strong><em>his sister</em></strong> <em>a laptop</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this sentence, there is an indirect object, “his sister,” and a direct object, “a laptop.” However, there is another way to say this same idea using a prepositional phrase.</p>
<ul>
<li>Donovan <strong>gave</strong> <em>a laptop</em> to his sister. In English, an indirect object may come between a transitive verb and the direct object, as the first example sentence about Donovan, or the indirect object could be in the form of a prepositional phrase, like the second example sentence about Donovan.</li>
</ul>
<p>An indirect object is only needed if the action is being done to or for somebody, when using a transitive verb, we need to include a direct object, but we may not need to include in indirect object.</p>
</section>
<section id="finding-the-object" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="finding-the-object">Finding the object</h2>
<p>We can figure out the object by using the question format: “The subject did what?” or “The subject ‘verb’ what?” The instructor <strong>addressed</strong> what <em>the student’s question</em></p>
<p>Miriam <strong>borrowed</strong> what? <em>the methodology book</em></p>
<p>Can you <strong>bring</strong> what? <em>your copy of the textbook</em></p>
<p>The speaker <strong>discussed</strong> what? <em>different marketing strategies</em></p>
<p>The committee members <strong>will raise</strong> what? <em>money</em></p>
<p>We can find the indirect by asking the question “To whom?” or “For whom?”</p>
<p>Donovan <strong>gave</strong> <em>a laptop</em> to whom? <em>his sister</em></p>
</section>
<section id="intransitive-verbs" class="level1">
<h1>Intransitive Verbs</h1>
<p>An intransitive verb does not take an object. Using an object immediately after an intransitive verb will create an incorrect sentence. However, there may be other information after the verb, such as one or more prepositional phrases or an <em>adverb</em>.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[!Example] Example Correct: The students <strong>arrived</strong> at the residency in Houston. Incorrect: The students <strong>arrived</strong> <em>Houston</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second sentence is incorrect because the verb cannot take an object.</p>
<p><strong>Example Sentences</strong></p>
<p>Some other examples of intransitive verbs are “deteriorate”, “vote”, “sit”, “increase”, “laugh”, “originate”, “fluctuate”, and “trend”.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The patient’s health <strong>deteriorated quickly</strong>. Ahmad <strong>voted</strong> in the local election. May I <strong>sit <em>here</em></strong> Attendance&nbsp;<strong>increased</strong>&nbsp;at the weekly study sessions&nbsp;as finals drew near. Susan <strong>laughed</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: An intransitive verb can take more than one prepositional phrase of adverb.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The patient’s health <strong>deteriorated <em>quickly</em></strong> <em>during the night</em>. Ahmad <strong>voted</strong> <em>for the incumbent</em> in the local election.</p>

  <title>Farm animals and Vegetables</title>
  <dc:creator>Hung </dc:creator>
  <link>https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/english-farm-animals-vegetables/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><strong>It has been suggested that primary children should learn how to grow vegetables and keep animals.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?</strong></p>
<p>David Lang’s essay:</p>
<p>Some today have argued that it would be a sensible policy to teach children how to farm and raise animals at school. In my opinion, though this would require enormous resources, it would be beneficial in terms of both physical and intellectual development.</p>
<p>Those arguing against this proposal point out the resources needed. In order to implement such an ambitious programs, schools would firstly need land nearby where animals and crops be raised. This might be possible within a school’s pre-existing grounds, but there would still need to be significant investment in infrastructure. Schools would therefore have to reallocate a significant portion of their budget, potentially reducing the money for crucial facilities, staff, and teaching resources.</p>
<p>However, the advantages for the holistic development of children is overwhelming. Students today spend more time than ever before passively using technological devices. By spending more time outdoors learning about animals and crops, students will better understand their position within the natural food chain. Overtime, this may lead them to adopt environmentally friendlier, compassionate lifestyle choices such as becoming vegetarians or shopping locally rather than buying from large chains. Moreover, the work outdoors would necessarily involve physical exercise. Since obesity is a growing concern in most countries, this time outside could help to improve standards of physical fitness and establish healthy lifelong habits.</p>
<p>In conclusion, despite the money this reform would require, schools should adopt it when possible so as to achieve a more complete education for students. Governments should consider the long-term effects when deciding on such policies.</p>
<section id="chat-gpt" class="level1">
<h1>Chat gpt</h1>
<p>The proposal to incorporate agricultural and animal husbandry education into primary school curricula has garnered attention. In my view, while such initiatives offer certain benefits, the potential drawbacks, particularly concerning resource allocation and health risks, are more significant.</p>
<p>Advocates highlight that engaging children in growing vegetables and caring for animals can foster responsibility and a connection to nature. These activities may enhance students’ understanding of food sources and promote environmental stewardship. However, implementing such programs requires substantial resources. Schools would need to invest in appropriate land, infrastructure, and trained personnel to oversee these activities. This financial commitment could divert funds from essential academic subjects, potentially compromising the quality of core education.</p>
<p>Moreover, there are health and safety concerns associated with young children handling soil and animals. Exposure to allergens, zoonotic diseases, and physical injuries are risks that cannot be overlooked. Ensuring proper hygiene and safety measures would necessitate additional oversight and training, further straining school resources.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while teaching primary children to cultivate plants and care for animals has educational merits, the associated disadvantages, particularly in terms of resource allocation and health risks, outweigh the benefits. Schools should prioritize core academic subjects and consider integrating environmental education through less resource-intensive methods.</p>
<p>💡 Why David Lang’s Essay Feels Simple but Scores High</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Clear structure</li>
</ol>
<p>Introduction: Directly paraphrases the question + gives a clear opinion.</p>
<p>Body 1: Discusses the opposite view.</p>
<p>Body 2: Presents his own view (which he supports).</p>
<p>Conclusion: Restates the opinion and wraps up.</p>
<p>👉 Why it works: Examiners love clarity. They’re not grading you on how “fancy” your structure is — just that it’s logical and easy to follow.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Precise vocabulary, not fancy vocabulary</li>
</ol>
<p>He uses natural, topic-specific language, like:</p>
<p>“holistic development”</p>
<p>“environmentally friendlier”</p>
<p>“passively using technological devices”</p>
<p>👉 Why it works: Band 9 vocabulary is about being accurate and appropriate, not sounding like a thesaurus.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Balanced ideas + developed examples</li>
</ol>
<p>He acknowledges the disadvantages (cost, resources) and then shows why advantages outweigh them (fitness, habits, awareness). He explains his points — not just states them.</p>
<p>👉 Why it works: IELTS cares about depth more than how many ideas you list. One strong idea with support = better than five weak ones.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Grammar is natural and controlled</li>
</ol>
<p>He uses complex sentences when needed, not to show off.</p>
<p>👉 Example:</p>
<p>“Since obesity is a growing concern in most countries, this time outside could help…”</p>
<p>That’s complex, but clear. No over-complicated structures.</p>
<p>✅ How YOU Can Write Like David Lang</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Follow a clean structure</li>
</ol>
<p>Intro: Paraphrase + opinion</p>
<p>Body 1: Opposing view</p>

<p>It’s short.</p>
<p>Clear opinion.</p>
<p>No fancy words. Just focused.</p>
<p>Would you like to try writing your own version of the introduction before we move on?</p>
<p>Or should we go ahead to Body Paragraph 1?</p>

  <title>Ielts task 1 - Household work</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><strong>In the past, knowledge was contained in books. Nowadays, knowledge is uploaded to the internet. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?</strong></p>
<p>It is a fact of modern life that most information today is store online, rather than in physical books as it was in the past. In my opinion, this is a negative despite its obvious conveniences.</p>
<p>Supporters of this trend can point to the numerous ways knowledge kept online can be disseminated and used. Online information is almost universally accessible, narrowing socioeconomic differences in society and allowing for various conveniences. First of all, users can find relevant information on search engines from a wide range of sources including user-generated sites like Wikipedia to news outlets like The New York Times and academic journals as well. Once an individual locates the information they are looking for, it is also easier to search within that article, share it with others, have it wherever they go and store more than would be possible if it were a hard copy.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, storing information online encourages a dependence on computer technology that is harmful for the human mind. In the past, if a person wanted to research a given topic, they would have to check out a library book or talk with an expert. This process was much slower and open to the possibility of bias. However, it also meant that individuals were more conscientious and patiently learned from fuller, more nuanced sources. Nowadays, most people read short articles, hastily written to attract more clicks and generate advertising revenue. These tap into a fundamental human need to be constantly engaged and feeling pleasure. Over time, this has led to a generation addicted to devices, lacking the healthy habits engendered by careful research and study.</p>
<p>In conclusion, despite the handiness of online information, the impact on the human psyche makes this a negative trend on level. Individuals must themselves find ways to counter these potentially injurious effects.</p>
<p>Sample positive essay:</p>
<p>In the digital age, the migration of knowledge from physical books to online platforms has become a defining feature of global society. While critics argue that this shift undermines intellectual depth and fosters dependency, I firmly believe the advantages of accessible, dynamic, and. collaborative information far surpass its drawbacks.</p>
<p>Proponent of online knowledge store emphasize its unparalleled capacity to democratize information. Unlike traditional books, which are more constrained by physical availability and cost, digital platforms grant instantaneous access to vast repositories of data for anyone with an internet connection. Students in remote villages, for instance, can now access lectures from Ivy League universities, download academic journals, or participate in global forums - opportunities once reserved for the socioeconomically privileged. Moreover, search engines and algorithms allow users to pinpoint precise information within seconds, a task that previously required hours of library search. The integration of multimedia - such as video, interactive graphs, and hyperlinks- further enriches understanding, catering to diverse learning styles. Crucially, digital storage eliminates the environmental toll of paper production, reducing deforestation and carbon emissions linked to printing and distributing physical books.</p>
<p>Detractors, however, contend that the internet fosters misinformation, distraction, and superficial engagement. While valid, these concern are not insurmountable. It is true that unverified content proliferates online, yet this issue is counterbalanced by the rise of fact-checking tools, peer-reviewed databases, and digital literacy programs that empower users to discern credible sources. Similarly, although the constant influx of notifications and bite-sized content risks fragmenting attentions spans, individuals and educators can cultivate disciplined usage through structured learning frameworks and mindfulness practices. The digital divide-limited internet access in impoverished regions - remains a challenge, yet global initiatives to expand connectivity, such as satellite internet projects and affordable mobile data, are steadily bridging this gap.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the transition to online knowledge storage represents a net positive for humanity. Its capacity to democratize education, enhance efficiency, and promote sustainability far outweighs manageable risks like misinformation and distraction. To maximize benefits, society must prioritize digital literacy and equitable access, ensuring the internet remains a force for collective progress.</p>
<section id="speaking" class="level1">
<h1>Speaking</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li>How often do most people use the internet? Most people use the internet daily, if not constantly. Smartphones and Wi-Fi have made it ubiquitous whether for work, social media, or streaming. For instance, younger generations might spend 6+ hours online, while older adults might use it less frequently but still rely on it for news or banking.</li>
<li>Are there drawbacks to its overuse? Absolutely. Overuse can lead to addiction, reduced productivity, and mental issues like anxiety or loneliness. Physically, screen time strains eyes and disrupts sleep. Socially, it erodes face-to-face interactions - think of families ignoring each other to scroll through phones. Moderation is key.</li>
<li>What kind of information can people find online? Virtually <em>anything</em>. From academic research on Google Scholar to DIY tutorials on Youtube, and even niche forums discussing obscure hobbies. However, misinformation is rampant too - fake news, biased articles, or conspiracy theories. Critical thinking is essential to navigate this flood of data.</li>
<li>How was this changed the way people get their information? It’s deepen integration into daily life. Think smart homes controlled via apps, AI-driven healthcare consultations, or virtual reality workspaces. However, privacy concerns will grow, and the digital divide may widen unless access becomes universal. Education and jobs will increasingly depend on digital literacy.</li>

  <title>How to Structure a ‘Two Question’ Essay</title>
  <dc:creator>Hung </dc:creator>
  <link>https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/two-question-essay/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Let’s look at an example of this kind of question:</p>
<pre><code>*Nowadays governments are investing more in public transport such as buses and trains rather than in building new roads.*
*What are the reasons for this?*
*Is this a positive or negative development?*</code></pre>
<section id="clear-position" class="level1">
<h1>Clear position</h1>
<p>For this kind of task we need to discuss both questions. In the first question, we are given a situation and asked to explain why. The second question requires a clear opinion so <strong>we must choose a side.</strong> This is very important for our task response score. If we don’t choose a side and support that ‘position’ clearly, we will lose marks for our task response. We will get a maximum of 5 for task achievement if we do not choose a side.</p>
<p>It’s not important which side we choose as long as we choose one. Here are the options for the second questions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Agree</strong>: We think it’s a positive development that governments are spending more money on public transport. We support this opinion.</li>
<li><strong>Disagree:</strong> We think it’s a negative development that governments are spending more money on public transport. We support this opinion.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="clear-essay-structure" class="level1">
<h1>Clear essay structure</h1>
<p>David Lang recommend that we should give our opinion in the introduction as well as the conclusion (for all IELTS Task 2 questions). It’s OK to write a very general introduction and leave our opinion to the end. But it’s not as clear and we might run out of time before we’ve hot to our conclusion, so overall it’s a risky strategy. If we don’t choose a side and support that ‘position’ clearly, we will lose marks for our task response.</p>
<p>Therefore, him suggested essay structure is four paragraphs. The opinion is presented in the introduction and re-stated in the conclusion. Ideally each body paragraph in the introduction and re-stated in the conclusion.</p>
</section>
<section id="possible-essay-structures" class="level1">

  <title>IELTS Essay Having Children at an Older Age</title>
  <dc:creator>Hung </dc:creator>
  <link>https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/having-children-at-older-age/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Question:</p>
<p><strong>Some people choose to have their first child at an older age.</strong> <strong>What are the reasons?</strong> <strong>Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?</strong></p>
<p>David Lang’s sample In recent years, an increasing number of individuals have opted to start their families later in life. This trend raises the question of why more people are choosing to have their first child at an older age and whether the benefits of doing so justify the drawbacks.</p>
<p>One of the primary reasons for delaying parenthood is the pursuit of career stability in a worrying economic climate. In today’s competitive job market, many individuals, particularly women, prefer to establish themselves professionally before starting a family. By focusing on their careers in their twenties and early thirties, they can achieve financial security and attain higher positions, which often translates to job satisfaction and greater resources for their future children. This growing trend is reflected in how mainstream society now places significant emphasis on personal development and achieving personal goals before embarking on parenthood. For that reason, many young adults prioritize their own personal and financial welfare, a situation that engenders an atmosphere less conductive to having children early in life.</p>
<p>There are legitimate disadvantages connected with having children later in life. One of the primary concerns is the potential health risks for both the mother and the child. Advanced maternal age is often associated with a higher risk of complications such as gestational diabetes, hypertension, and chromosomal abnormalities. However, despite these drawbacks, the advantages of having children later in life due to greater maturity overshadow the hypothetical drawbacks. The emotional maturity and life experience that older parents bring to child-rearing can result in a more stable and nurturing environment. Older parents are likely to be more financially secure and better prepared to provide for their children’s education and well-being. The ability to make well-considered decisions and the patience developed over time can contribute to a more thoughtful and deliberate approach to parenting.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while there are valid concerns regarding the health risks associated with having children later in life, the benefits, such as financial stability, emotional maturity, and better preparation for parenthood, outweigh these disadvantages. As societal norms and medical advancements continue to evolve, the rend of delaying parenthood is likely to remain prevalent, reflecting the changing priorities and values of modern individuals.</p>
<p>Sample, disadvantages over advantages.</p>
<p>An increasing number of individuals are choosing to have their first child at an older age. This trend is driven by factors such as career prioritization, financial security, and a desire for greater personal maturity. While some argue that the benefits of delayed parenthood - like improved financial stability and enhanced life experience - outweigh the disadvantages, I strongly disagree. The potential health risks, fertility issues, and other practical challenges mean that the disadvantages ultimately outweigh any advantages.</p>
<p>Modern society has shifted priorities, and many couples now postpone parenthood for several reasons. Primarily, individuals strive to establish their careers and achieve financial stability before starting a family. This approach allows prospective parents to create a secure environment for their child, free from economic uncertainty. Furthermore, many believe that greater life experience and emotional maturity can lead to more thoughtful parenting decisions. As a result, the decision to delay having a first child is often seen as a strategic move to optimize one’s personal and professional circumstances.</p>
<p>Despite these reasons, the drawbacks of having a first child at an older age are significant. Health concerns are paramount; older mothers face increased risks of pregnancy complications, such as gestational diabetes and hypertension, which can jeopardize both maternal and infant health. Additionally, advancing age is closely linked to decreased fertility, often necessitating expensive and emotionally draining fertility treatments. Beyond health, older parents might experience reduced physical stamina, which is crucial for the demanding nature of childcare, and a larger generational gap that can affect the parent-child relationship. These challenges make the prospect of delayed parenthood less attractive, as the risks and long-term implications overshadow the benefits of waiting.</p>
<p>In conclusion, although delaying parenthood may provide some advantages in terms of financial and emotional preparedness, the significant health risks, fertility challenges, and practical issues associated with having a first child later in life outweigh these benefit. Therefore, i contend that the disadvantages of postponing parenthood ultimately make it a less favorable option compared to earlier family planning.</p>
<p>Sample, advantages over disadvantages.</p>
<p>In recent years, an increasing number of individuals have chosen to have their first child at an older age. This trend is largely influenced by factors such as the pursuit of career goals, the desire for financial stability, and the accumulation of life experience before entering parenthood. I firmly believe that these advantages not only lead to more secure and thoughtful family planning but also contribute to improved parenting outcomes, ultimately outweighing the potential disadvantages.</p>
<p>Modern societal shifts have prompted many prospective parents to postpone starting a family. Primarily, individuals are keen to establish a stable career and secure a robust financial foundation before welcoming a child. This approach allows them to create a nurturing environment where the child’s needs are met without the stress of <strong>economic uncertainty</strong>. Furthermore, waiting until later in life often results in enhanced emotional maturity and life experience, enabling parents to make more considered decisions and effectively manage the challenges of raising a child. These reasons underscore why many see value in delaying parenthood as a strategic, long-term investment in both personal and familial well-being.</p>
<p>The advantages of choosing to have a child at an older age are manifold. With a well-established career and financial security, older parents are better equipped to provide for their child’s educational and extracurricular needs, contributing to the child’s overall development. In addition, greater maturity and life experience often translate into more patient, empathetic, and balanced parenting. Such parents typically possess enhanced problem-solving skills and resilience, which can be invaluable when navigating the inevitable challenges of childcare. Moreover, studies have shown that older parents tend to invest more time and resources in their children’s upbringing, resulting in a more stable and nurturing home environment. Collectively, these advantages not only promote healthier family dynamics but also pave the way for the child’s long-term success and well-being.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while there are inherent challenges associated with delayed parenthood, the benefits- ranging from financial stability and career establishment to increased emotional maturity and effective parenting- clearly outweigh the drawbacks. By choosing to have a child at an older age, many individuals are better prepared to offer a secure, supportive, and enriching environment for their children, ultimately leading to more positive outcomes for families.</p>

  <title>IELTS Essay Financial Matters</title>
  <dc:creator>Hung </dc:creator>
  <link>https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/financial-matters/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Question:</p>
<p><strong>In numerous nations, there is a growing trend for individuals to frequently discuss financial matters, such as their earnings or expenditure, in everyday conversation</strong>. <strong>What are the reasons behind this phenomenon?</strong> <strong>Is it advantageous or detrimental?</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>There is an increasing tendency for individuals in the modern world to openly discuss their finances in daily conversation. In my opinion, this is a result of a general lack of self-awareness and is decidedly negative given the opportunity cost it engenders.</p>
<p>The primary reason many people are prone to talk their financial dealings originates in society generally. In the past, a sense of modesty or concern for decorum might have compelled reticence. Today, some of the most widely discussed topics in the media, online, in film, and in literature concern cryptocurrencies, the real estate market, stock equities, the price of gold, and other investments. A person discussing these matters is likely only interested in subtle boasting if venting frustrations without awareness of the emotions or engagement of their interlocutor. The result over time has been that many people have developed a shameless habit.</p>
<p>In my view, discussion finances often precludes a number of more worthwhile topics of conversation. Since the majority of useful financial research can be conducted online or done in professional settings, there are more pressing areas that should be discussed in daily life. For example, two friends having a conversation at a cafe would derive greater value from telling stories, joking with one another, or delving into a more serious topic related to politics, the arts, or psychology. Such discussions are likely to develop their understanding of the world and their emotional intelligence. Discussion of money, on the other hand, wastes valuable time and energy for little concrete outcome.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the inclination to speak of one’s personal finances stems from a fundamentally modern self-indulgence and often prevents the discussion of more enjoyable or meaningful topics. Naturally, these generalizations do not apply to all individuals.</p>
<hr>
<p>ChatGPT’s essay:</p>
<p>In numerous nations, a growing trend has emerged where people openly discuss financial matters, including their earnings and expenditures, in everyday conversations. This phenomenon can be attributed to a range of social and economic factors, and i firmly believe that it is advantageous. Open dialogue about personal finances not only foster financial literacy but also encourages better money management and transparency within communities.</p>
<p>One primary reason for this trend is the rapid spread of financial education and the influence of digital media. With the advent of social media platforms and financial blogs, individuals have unprecedented access to information about budgeting, investing, and saving. This exposure has led many to feel more confident in discussing their financial situations, as they seek advice and validation from peers. Additionally, economic uncertainty in many regions has prompted individuals to share personal financial experiences as a way of coping and learning from one another. For instance, during periods of economic downturn, people often exchange tips on reducing expenses or finding alternative income sources. This collective sharing not only helps individuals navigate challenging time but also creates a support network where practical financial strategies are exchanged openly.</p>
<p>The open discussion of financial matters carries significant benefits for both individuals and society at large. Firstly, it promotes financial literacy by normalizing conversations about money, which can demystify complex financial topic and empower people to make informed decisions. As people become more knowledgeable about financial planning and investment strategies, they are better equipped to secure their futures and contribute to economic growth. Secondly, this trend encourages transparency and accountability, reducing the stigma around discussing personal finances. For example, when individuals talk about budgeting and debt management, it can inspire others to examine their own spending habits, ultimately leading to a more financially responsible community. By fostering an environment where financial struggles and successes are shared openly, society as a whole benefits from improved financial stability and reduced inequality.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the increasing tendency for individuals to discuss financial matters in everyday conversation is driven by greater access to information and a need for mutual support during uncertain economic times. I contend that this development is advantageous, as it enhances financial literacy, transparency, and responsible money management. Ultimately, such open dialogue can empower communities to achieve greater financial stability and economic well-being.</p>

  <title>IELTS Essay Writing by Hand</title>
  <dc:creator>Hung </dc:creator>
  <link>https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/writing-by-hand/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Question:</p>
<p><strong>Fewer and fewer people today write by hand using a pen or pencil.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What are the reasons for this?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Is this a positive or a negative development?</strong></p>
<p>David Lang’s essay:</p>
<p>Today, the act of writing by hand using a pen or pencil has become increasingly uncommon. This essay will delve into the reasons behind this trend and evaluate whether it is a positive or negative development for individuals and society as a whole.</p>
<p>One primary reason for the dwindling use of handwriting is the pervasive presence of technology. Inn an age dominated by computers, smartphones, and tables, individuals find it more convenient to type their thoughts and ideas rather than engaging in the laborious process of writing by hand. The speed and efficiency offered by digital devices have made it easier to edit, store, and share written content, rendering handwriting seemingly obsolete. To illustrate this, consider the rapid rise of communication platforms such as email, instant messaging apps, and social media. These platforms provide users with the ability to effortlessly send and receive messages, eliminating the need for handwritten letters or notes. This convenience extends to practical considerations for professionals in various fields, such as journalists, researchers, and writers, who often rely on digital platforms and word processors for their work. The ease of editing, revising, and sharing digital content outweighs the traditional pen-and-paper approach.</p>
<p>While the decline of handwriting may offer certain advantages, it also brings forth potential negative consequences. Handwriting is an essential skill that fosters cognitive development, improves memory retention, and allows for creative expression. The act of physically forming letters and words engages different areas of the brain, promoting better comprehension and critical thinking skills. Losing this skill may hinder individuals ability to think and express themselves effectively. Most importantly, the personal touch and emotional connection associated with handwritten letters or cards cannot be replicated by digital alternatives. Handwritten messages convey sincerity, thoughtfulness, and a see of intimacy. Losing the art of handwriting may irrevocably erode these meaningful human connections.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the decline of handwriting can be attributed to the prevalence of technology and practical considerations. While there are advantages to digital communication and typing, the negative implications for cognitive development and personal connections are more significant and must be mitigated by the relevant authorities.</p>
<p>Arguing that it is a positive development</p>
<p>In today’s digital age, fewer and fewer people write by hand and using a pen or pencil. This shift can be attributed to pared technological advancements and changing educational practices, and I firmly believe that it is a positive development. The move away from handwriting not only enhances efficiency and accessibility but also reflects progress towards modern communication methods.</p>
<p>The decline in handwriting is primarily driven by the ubiquity of digital devices and evolving communication needs. With the widespread availability of computers, smartphones, and tablets, individuals find it more convenient to type and send messages instantly. Educational institutions are increasingly incorporating technology into their curricula, emphasizing digital literacy over traditional penmanship. Moreover, the rise of social media and email as primary communication tools has diminished the need for handwritten correspondence. These factors have collectively contributed to a cultural shift where efficiency and speed in communication are prioritized over the art of handwriting.</p>
<p>Transitioning from handwriting to digital writing brings several significant benefits. Firstly, digital communication enhances productivity by enabling rapid information exchange and easy editing, which is especially beneficial in professional and academic settings. Additionally, typing reduces issues related to illegible handwriting, thereby minimizing misunderstandings. Digital platforms also offer vast storage and the ability to search through documents instantly, streamlining information management. Furthermore, this shift is environmentally friendly, as it reduces the consumption of paper and other stationery supplies. Overall, the adoption of digital writing foster greater accessibility and adaptability in our fast-pace, globalized world, contributing to more efficient and sustainable practices.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the decreasing reliance on handwriting in favor of digital communication is driven by technological advancements and evolving social practices. I contend that this development is positive, as it significantly boosts efficiency, clarity, and environmental sustainability while aligning with the demands of modern life. Embracing digital writing is not only a natural progression but also a vital step towards more effective and accessible communication in the 21st century.</p>

<h1>What are topic sentence ?</h1>
<p>The standard essay structure for a IELTS Task 2 essay is four paragraphs - an introduction, two body paragraphs and a conclusion.</p>
<p>The topic sentence is the first sentence of each body paragraph. It tells the examiner the main idea of the paragraph so it functions like a mini introduction.</p>

<h1>Why are Topic Sentences Important?</h1>
<p>Good topic sentences help to make our paragraphs clear and easy to read.</p>
<p>As we can see from the table below, clear paragraphs really help our coherence and cohesion score.</p>

<h1>How to Write a Good Topic Sentence ?</h1>
<p>A good topic sentence should be clear and simple.</p>
<p>A basic topic sentence has two parts: 1. The topic. 2. The reason / main idea. ![[18920776_935567866585887_4103732896360495495_o-768x575.jpg]]</p>
<p><strong>Example Question</strong></p>
<pre><code>Global warming/Climate change are pressing problems that every country and the world will have to deal with in the future.
What are the causes of global warming ?
What are some possible solutions ?</code></pre>
<p><strong>Body paragraph 1 (the main cause of global warming)</strong> Topic: the main cause of global warming Reason/ main idea: mass consumption of fossil fuels</p>
<p>So the topic sentence is: The main cause of climate change is the mass consumption of fossil fuels.</p>
<p><strong>Body paragraph 2 (a possible solution)</strong></p>
<p>Topic: one possible solution for dealing with global warming Reason/main idea: higher taxes on automobiles</p>
<p>The topic sentence is: One possible solution for dealing with climate change could be higher taxes on automobiles.</p>
</section>
<section id="topic-sentence-will-help-us-to-stay-married-to-one-main-idea." class="level1">
<h1>Topic sentence will help us to stay married to one main idea.</h1>
<p>As we saw in the table above, we should “present a clear central topic within each paragraph”. This means each body paragraph should be focused on just one main idea.</p>
<p>Therefore planning for our topic sentences helps us to decide what is the main idea for that paragraph.</p>
<p>After that we should ONLY think of support for that idea. We are married to that main idea. We can’t cheat on it with another main idea.</p>
<p>So for the following topic sentence, we should only discuss the mass consumption of fuels.</p>
<pre><code>The main cause of climate change is the mass consumption of fossil fuels.</code></pre>
<p>Some students spend nearly the whole paragraph discussing one main idea. But then near the end, they seem to panic or get overexcited, and suddenly add a second unrelated idea e.g.&nbsp;deforestation or methane emissions from animals. This is a very common mistake but as the table above showed this will lower our coherence and cohesion score. Remember each paragraph can only have “one central topic”. As part of our planning stage in the task 2 writing exam, we should write down our topic sentences. This will make it easier when we start writing our essay to keep our supporting ideas clear, and focused on our main idea. If we accidentally include a second main idea at the end - cross it out. Stay focused.</p>

  <title>Ielts task 1 - Household work</title>
  <dc:creator>Hung </dc:creator>
  <link>https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/household-work/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><em>The bar chart below shows the average duration of household women did (unemployed, part-time employed and full-time) when compared to men who had full-time work in the UK between 1985 and 2005.</em></p>
<p><em>Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.</em></p>
<p><img src="https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/household-work/Pasted image 20250328022514.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The bar chart details hours of housework completed in the UK from 1985 to 2005 by fully employed males and females with various states of employment. Looking from an overall perspective, it is readily apparent that time spent on housework rose for all groups with the exception of unemployed women, which was stable overall. However, the latter category undertook by far the most housework, while men with full-time jobs did comparatively little.</p>
<p>Unemployed women led throughout the period in terms of hours, at a peak of 7 hours in 1985 and 2005 and a slight dip to 6.5 hours in between. In contrast, men with full-time work were unchanged at just 1 hour in 1985 and 1995, though there was a slight rise to 1.5 hours in 2005.</p>
<p>Women with part-time employment were slightly lower than their unemployed counterparts throughout the period, beginning at 5.3 hours in 1985, before declining to 5 hours over the next 5 years, and then finishing the period with a surge to 6 hours. The figures for women with full-time employment resembled those of men, though they were marginally higher at 2, 1.5, and 2.8 hours in 1985, 1995, and 2005, respectively.</p>

<section id="tidiness" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tidiness"><strong>Tidiness</strong></h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>Are you a tidy person? Yes, I would say I’m quite a tidy person. I like to keep my things organized, whether it’s my room, desk, or digital files. I find that being tidy helps me concentrate better and reduces stress.</li>
<li>Are you more tidy at home or at school? I’m generally tidy in both places, but I’d say I’m more careful about tidiness at school or work. I think that’s because I want to create a good impression and maintain a productive environment. At home, I might be a bit more relaxed, especially when I’m tired.</li>
<li>Were you tidy as a child? Not really! When I was a child, I was pretty messy. My toys and clothes were usually all over the place, and my parents had to remind me constantly to clean up. It wasn’t until I got older that I started appreciating the value of being organized.</li>
<li>Are people in your country very tidy? It depends on the individual, but in general, I think people in my country value cleanliness and order, especially in public spaces. There’s a strong emphasis on hygiene and keeping things neat, though of course, there are exceptions.</li>
</ol>
<p>not tidy:</p>
<ul>
<li>To be honest, I’m not the tidiest person. I try to keep things in order, but I often get caught up in other tasks and end up leaving a bit of a mess behind. It’s not that I enjoy clutter - I just tend to prioritize other things over cleaning. That said, I do try to do a proper tidy-up when it gets out of hand.</li>
<li>I’m definitely less tidy at home. When I’m at school or work, I feel a bit more pressure to maintain a neat space, especially if I’m sharing it with others. But at home, I tend to [[let things slide]] - especially if I’m busy or tired. My room isn’t chaotic, but it’s far from spotless.</li>
<li>Not at all. I was one of those kids who always had toys and books scattered everywhere. My parents used to joke that a tornado had hit my room. Tidiness just wasn’t something I [[paid attention to]] - I was more interested in playing or creating things than cleaning up after myself.</li>
<li>I think it varies a lot. Some people are incredibly meticulous and keep everything spotless, while others are more laid-back like me. I wouldn’t say tidiness is a national trait - it really depends on the individuals and sometimes on how they were raised.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tidiness: 1. Are you a tidy person ? Yes, I would definitely consider myself a tidy person. I find that having a clean and organized environment helps my think more clearly and stay focused. Tidiness isn’t just about appearance for me - it’s more about creating a calm and efficient space where I can function at my best. 2. Are you more tidy at home or at school? I’d say I’m equally tidy in both settings, but in slightly different ways. At home, I like everything to be in its space - I clean regularly and keep my space minimalist. At school or work, I might not be as meticulous with deep cleaning, but I still keep my desk organized and clutter-free. It helps me stay productive and avoid distractions. 3. Were you tidy as a child? Yes, even as a child I had a habit of keeping things neat. I used to arrange my books by color and make sure my toys were stored properly after playing. It wasn’t something my parents had to enforce - I think I just naturally liked having order around me. That tendency has definitely [[carried over]] into adulthood. 4. Are people in your country very tidy? I believe it depends on the person, but overall, people in my country do value cleanliness and order, especially in shared or public spaces. There’s a strong cultural emphasis on personal hygiene and maintaining a tidy home, particularly when guest are visiting. However, standards or tidiness can vary widely from one household to another.</p>
</section>
<section id="part-3" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="part-3">Part 3</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Do you think tidiness is important in the workplace? Absolutely. A tidy workplace not only creates a more professional image but also boosts efficiency. When things are organized, it’s easier to find what you need, which saves time and reduce stress. Moreover, a clean environment can promote better focus and even improve team morale.</li>
<li>Why do some people struggle to stay tidy? There could be a few reasons. Some people simply lead very busy lives and don’t prioritize tidiness, while others may not have developed habits of organization from a young age. In some cases, people might not even notice the mess around them - they’ve grown accustomed to it. For a few, it could also be tied to mental health challenges, like anxiety or ADHD, which can effect one’s ability to maintain order.</li>
<li>How can parents teach children to be tidy? The most effective way is by setting a good example. If children see their parents consistently keeping things organized, they’re more likely to adopt those habits themselves. It also helps to make tidying part of a daily routine and turn it into something fun or rewarding - for instance, though games or praise. Teaching them to take pride in their space can go a long way.</li>
<li>Do you think technology helps people stay more organized and tidy? Definitely. There are so many apps and digital tools now that can help people manages their time, declutter digitally, and keep track of tasks or schedules. Even simple things like calendar reminder or to-do list apps can encourage tidier habits. That said, technology can also contribute to digital clutter if not used mindfully.</li>
<li>Is there a difference in tidiness between younger and older generations? In some ways, yes. Older generations often place a high value on physical tidiness, perhaps because they grew up in a time when everything had to be done manually. Younger people, on the other hand, might prioritize digital organization - like keeping their phones or laptops neatly arranged. However, i think personal habits play a bigger role than age.</li>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><em>Zoos have long been a subject of debate. While some people argue that zoos play a crucial role in conserving endangered species and educating the public about wildlife, others contend that confining animals to artificial environments is unethical. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.</em></p>
<section id="analysis" class="level1">
<h1>Analysis</h1>
<p>Advantage: pros: Conservation zoos often participate in breeding programs and reintroduction efforts for endangered species. Education: They provide a unique opportunity for the public to learn about wildlife and environmental issues. Research: Zoos support scientific research and rehabilitation programs that can benefit species survival</p>
<p>Disadvantage Cons: Ethical concerns: Confining animals can lead to physical and psychological stress, raising serious animal welfare issues. Natural Behavior: The artificial habitats in zoos may prevent animals from expressing their natural behaviors, potentially leading to a diminished quality of life.</p>
</section>
<section id="sample" class="level1">
<h1>Sample</h1>
<p>In recent years, zoos have become a focal point of heated debate. On the one hand, proponents argue that zoos are indispensable for conserving endangered species and educating the public. On the other hand, critics maintain that confining animals to unnatural settings is inherently unethical. In my view, while the welfare of captive animals must be a priority, the benefits of well-managed zoos in conservation and education are substantial.</p>
<p>Supporters of zoos highlight their critical role in preserving biodiversity. With numerous species facing extinction, zoos provide a controlled environment where endangered animals can be bred and nurtured away from the threats of habitat loss and poaching. Many institutions have pioneered successful breeding programs, subsequently reintroducing species into the wild. Moreover, zoos serve as a vital educational platform, offering visitors first-hand exposure to wildlife. This experience not only fosters environmental awareness but also inspires future generations to engage in conservation efforts. Additionally, ongoing research in these settings has led to significant advancements in veterinary medicine and species rehabilitation.</p>
<p>Conversely, opponents argue that the confinement of animals infringes on their natural rights. Critics assert that even the most well-intentioned zoos cannot replicate the complex ecosystems that wild animals depend on, often leading to behavioral and psychological issues. The ethical debate is further intensified by instances of inadequate care and substandard living conditions in some facilities. While these concerns are valid, they underscore the need for stringent regulations rather than the outright dismissal of zoos as an institution.</p>
<p>In conclusion, although the ethical implications of captivity are significant, I believe that the conservation, education, and research benefits provided by zoos justify their existence - provided that animal welfare is rigorously safeguarded. This balanced approach can ensure that zoos continue to contribute positively to both wildlife preservation and public understanding of environmental issues.</p>

</ul>
<hr>
<p>Zoos have sparked widespread debate for decades. While many view them as essential institutions for wildlife conservation and public education, others believe that they are inherently unethical due to the unnatural confinement of animals. This essay will examine both perspectives before arguing that, under strict regulations, zoos can offer more benefits than harm.</p>
<p>Supporters of zoos emphasize their role in protecting endangered species. Many animals face threats such as habitat destruction, poaching, and climate change, and zoos offer a controlled environment for breeding and recovery. Additionally, modern zoos serve as educational platforms. They allow people, especially children, to learn about wildlife up close, fostering a sense of connection and responsibility toward environmental preservation. In this way, zoos contribute not only to species survival but also to broader conservation efforts.</p>
<p>On the other hand, critics argue that keeping animals in captivity is inherently cruel. Wild animals, particularly large or intelligent species, often display signs of stress, such as pacing of self-harm, when confined to small or unnatural enclosures. Moreover, some zoos operate more like entertainment venues than conservation centers, prioritizing visitor experience over animal welfare. This raise ethical concerns, particularly when animals are denied the opportunity to engage in natural behaviors or live in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while concerns about animal welfare in zoos are valid, I believe that when zoos are properly regulated and focus on genuine conservation and education, they play a vital role in protecting biodiversity. Rather than abolishing zoos entirely, efforts should focus on improving standards to ensure they serve both animals and society ethically.</p>

<p>One place that comes to mind is the Singapore Zoo, which I visited a couple of years ago. It’s located in the northern part of the city and is widely regarded as one of the most ethical and well-designed zoos in the world.</p>
<p>What impressed me most was the open-concept layout. Instead of case, many animals live in naturalistic habitats separated from visitors by moats or hidden barriers. I was able to observe orangutans swinging freely in trees above the walkways and giraffes roaming spacious enclosures.</p>
<p>There were also interactive sessions, such as feeding times and educational talks by zookeepers, where I learned a lot about endangered species and conservation efforts. The zoo also partners with various wildlife protection organizations and supports breeding programs for rare species.</p>
<p>I felt genuinely inspired by the experience. It made me realize that when zoos are operated responsibly, they can help preserve biodiversity and raise public awareness about the threats facing wildlife today. I felt the zoo feeling hopeful and more committed to supporting conservation causes.</p>

<p>Yes, I believe they are still necessary, but only under strict ethical and scientific standards.

<p>Wildlife sanctuaries and virtual reality experiences might be viable alternatives.

<p>The argument that expanding the exotic animal exhibit will increase zoo revenue is unconvincing, as it rests on several questionable assumptions and lacks sufficient supporting evidence. Without addressing these issues, the zoo may risk investing in an initiative that fails to produce the expected benefits.</p>
<p>First, the argument assumes a direct causal relationship between exotic animals and increased attendance. While the director cites a survey indicating that 85% of new visitors came specifically to see exotic species, this data may be misleading. The survey does not clarify whether these visitors would have attended the zoo regardless of the exhibit, nor does it prove that exotic animals were the primary motivator. Other factors such as promotions, seasonal events, or group tours may have influenced their visit. Without clear evidence of causation, the conclusion remains speculative.</p>
<p>Secondly, the reliability of the survey itself is questionable. The argument does not provide information about the sample size, methodology, or representativeness of the surveyed visitors. For instance, if the survey was conducted only during a temporary exotic animal showcase, the data may not reflect general visitor preferences. Additionally, focusing solely on new visitors ignores the preferences of returning guests, who may value other aspects of the zoo such as local wildlife, interactive experiences, or conservation programs.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the argument overlooks potential downsides and costs associated with expanding the exhibit. Exotic animals often require specialized care, habitats, and veterinary expertise, which can significantly increase operating expenses. If the new exhibit fails to attract sufficient new visitors or if existing patrons are alienated by the change, the zoo might face financial losses rather than gains. A cost-benefit analysis would be necessary to determine whether the investment is justified.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the argument makes a hasty recommendation based on incomplete and possibly flawed evidence. To strengthen the case, the director should conduct more comprehensive research, including long-term visitor trends, preferences of different demographics, and a detailed financial projection. Only then can the zoo make an informed decision about expanding its exotic animal exhibit.</p>

<p><em>Health services are a basic necessity. However, private companies have made them quite costly for ordinary individuals</em> <em>Do the advantages of private health care outweigh its disadvantage</em></p>
<section id="analysis" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>Advantages of Private Health Care: - Efficiency and shorter Waiting Times: Private hospitals offer quicker services compare to public hospitals, where long waiting lists are common. - Better facilities and advanced technology: Many private health institution provide cutting-edge medical technology, specialized treatments, and higher standards of care. - Greater Patient Choice: Individuals can select their preferred doctors, hospitals, and treatment plans, leading to more personalized care. Disadvantages of Private Health Care: - High costs and Limited Accessibility: Private health care is expensive, making it inaccessible for low-income individuals who cannot afford quality treatment. - Profit-driven System: The focus on profit can sometimes lead to unnecessary medical procedures, overcharging, or prioritizing financial gain over patient well-being. - Health inequality: A reliance on private health care can widen the gap between the rich and the poor, as only those who can afford it receive top-tier medical services. ## Sample essay Health care is an essential service, yet private medical facilities often make it unaffordable for many individuals. While private health care offers significant advantages such as efficiency, superior technology, and greater patient choice, it also has considerable drawbacks, particularly its high costs and contribution to social inequality. In my view, although private health care enhances medical standards, its disadvantages outweigh its benefits due to its exclusive and financial burden on ordinary citizens.</p>
<p>One of the key benefits of private health care is it efficiency. Unlike public hospitals, which often suffer from overcrowding and long waiting times, private institutions provide quicker access to medical attention. This is particularly crucial for emergency treatments or specialized procedures that require immediate intervention. Additionally, private hospitals invest heavily in advanced medical technology and modern infrastructure, ensuring high-quality treatment and specialized care. For instance, many private institutions offer robotic surgeries and personalized cancer treatments, which are not always available in public hospitals. Furthermore, private health care allows patients to choose their doctors and treatment plans, leading to a more personalized and comfortable experience.</p>
<p>However, the drawbacks of private health care are significant. The most pressing concern is its exorbitant cost, making it unaffordable for a large portion of the population. Many life-saving procedures and medications are out of reach for lower-income individuals, forcing them to rely on overstretched public health systems. Furthermore, because private hospitals overate on a profit-driven model, there is a risk of unnecessary procedures being performed to maximize revenue, sometimes at the expensive of patient welfare. Lastly, the presence of an expensive private health care sector creates a divide between the wealthy and the poor, exacerbating health inequalities. In countries without strong public health care, the underprivileged often suffer from preventable diseases simply due to financial constraints.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while private health care provides high-quality services and efficiency, its high costs and potential for exploitation make it a less viable option for the general population. A well-functioning public health system remains crucial to ensuring that medical care is accessible to all, regardless of financial status. Governments should regulate private health care costs and prioritize investment in public health services to balance quality with accessibility.</p>

<h1>David Lang’s essay</h1>
<p>Today, the cost of basic health services due to privatization has risen dramatically. In my opinion, although this can lead to greater innovation in the medical field, it is a negative burden overall for the average person.</p>
<p>Those who argue in favor of private medical care point out the benefits for medical knowledge generally. There is significant evidence in a wide range of industries as to the efficacy of privatization in driving innovation. The medical field i no different as hospitals in countries such as United States compete to develop innovative therapies and procedures that can enhance their reputations and generate higher revenues. These efforts in turn encourage the hiring of the brightest medical minds in the world. Without such competition, it is unlikely that many current advances in medical technology would exist at all.</p>
<p>However, these advances do little do alleviate the dramatic financial repercussions for ordinary citizens. In the United States, a person without medical insurance is likely to owe at least thousands for relatively simple procedure. Contrast this approach with many western European nations that function on a socialized approach to medicine. In these countries, a person is comforted by the knowledge that a trip to the hospital or consultation with a doctor will be largely paid for by the government. The result of this more equal system is that there is little disparity in the care given to the wealthy and less affluent segments of population.</p>
<p>In conclusion, despite the value of stimulating competition among medical institutions, there would be greater impact in a scheme wherein the individual could receive medical care without incurring excessive expenses. In many countries, this is already the situation.</p>

<section id="question" class="level1">
<h1>Question</h1>
<p><em>Due to television and the internet it is easier today for a large number of people to become famous. Is this a positive or negative development?</em></p>
<p>David Lang;</p>
<p>It is easier than ever today for people to become famous because of increased channels for distribution such as television and the internet. This is clearly a positive trend as it opens up the entertainment industry to greater diversity.</p>
<p>Those who decry this trend typically to talentless celebrities. In the past, a comedian or musician might work for years honing their craft in order to get a slot on one of the few talkshows and then become famous overnight. Nowadays, many celebrities start on reality TV or a YouTube channel and do not have any discernible talents. The socialite Paris Hilton was one of the first to take advantage of her wealth who through dating celebrities and canny use of social media and television was able to become a celebrity in her own right.</p>
<p>Despite the aforementioned cases, this is on a whole a positive trend because of the more diverse range of famous people today. Fame used to be the prerogative of white men and women, with the occasional exception from an ethnic group. One of the reasons for this is that whites typically come from more privileged backgrounds and have greater opportunities, thereby making up a disproportionate share of success stories. The internet in particular has leveled the playing field to an extent. Anyone with a smartphone today has the ability to broadcast their talents and cultivate a loyal fanbase, regardless of gender or ethnicity and without the barriers that existed in the past such as ingrained reluctance from authority figures to give certain ethnicities an honest chance.</p>
<p>In conclusion, there are clear cultural drawbacks to the ease with which many achieve fame but today it is nonetheless more inclusive. A greater concern should be the age at which people become famous as it can have developmental side effects.</p>
<p>ChatGPT:</p>
<p>In today’s digital age, becoming famous is easier than ever due to the explosion of online platforms and television opportunities. While some see this as a democratization of fame, it is, in reality, a negative development that has diminished the value of talent, effort, and cultural depth.</p>
<p>Fame today is often disconnected from genuine ability. In the past, achieving celebrity status typically required years of dedication to a particular craft. A musician, for instance, might have spent decades perfecting their skills before getting a rare shot on a major talk show. This long road filtered out the mediocre and ensured that fame reflected a certain level of excellence. By contrast, many modern celebrities rise to prominence through reality TV or social media, sometimes without any identifiable talent. Paris hilton is prime example, became a household name not because of any specific talent, but because of her social status and media presence. Similarly, Kim Kardashian built a brand through strategic use of television and social media, not through traditional artistic or professional success.</p>
<p>This shift also sends a harmful message to younger generations: that fame can be achieved without effort or substance. As a result, more people may value visibility over personal development or hard work. In previous decades, fame was generally linked to expertise or originality - actors, musicians, writers, and athletes were admired for what they did, not just who they were. Today, however, social media influencers can gain millions of followers by simply being entertaining or attractive online. This can create unrealistic aspirations and encourage superficiality. Furthermore, the psychological impact of sudden fame, especially among young people, cannot be ignored. Many find themselves under intense pressure to maintain their online image, which can lead to mental health challenges such as anxiety, stress, and loss of identity.</p>
<p>In conclusion, although more people now have the opportunity to become famous, the way fame is achieved today often undermines the importance of talent, discipline, and meaningful contribution. This is a negative development that not only lowers cultural standards but also risks harming individuals who are unprepared for the realities of public life. Rather than celebrating fame for its own sake, society should place more value on substance and long-term achievement.</p>

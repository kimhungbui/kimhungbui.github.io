  <title>Explaining and Clarifying ideas</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<section id="explaining-an-idea---when-and-how" class="level1" data-number="1">
<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Explaining an idea - when and how</h1>
<p>As part of our argument, we may need to give an explanation. We can do this to explain the meaning of a key term, explain the context for our ideas, or explain a complex idea in a simpler way. A question we are often asked is, ‘How do I know when I need to explain an idea?’.</p>
<p>We wrote about the topic of homelessness, and the issues surrounding this topic are generally the same in many parts of the world. However, with other topics, this is often not the case, which is why our ideas sometimes need to be explained further. For example, when writing about eating healthy, one person might make the following argument.</p>
<p><em>It is important to eat fruit every day, because it contains vitamins that help keep us healthy. Therefore, I completely agree with the idea that schools should encourage all children to eat fruit.</em></p>
<p>However, someone with an intolerance to fruit, who gets a severe stomach ache and skin problems after eating it, may write:</p>
<p><em>Eating fruit makes people feel unwell, and it even affects their ability to work. Therefore, I completely disagree with the idea that schools should encourage all children to eat fruit.</em></p>
<p>Anyone without the same intolerance is likely to be confused by the first statement in this argument. Again, language plays a key part: this is not a fact that is generally true for <em>everyone</em>, yet the use of the simple present suggests that it is. Using modal verbs (<em>may, can, etc</em>), as well as words and phrases like ‘<em>sometimes</em>’, ‘<em>for some people</em>’, helps to clarify ideas like this. For example:</p>
<p><em>Eating fruit can make some people feel unwell, and it can even affect their ability to work. Therefore, I completely disagree with the idea that schools should encourage all children to eat fruit.</em></p>
<p>In this version, the writer has presented a fact that logically supports their argument, and helps the reader understand why they hold this position.</p>
<p>Our test question will sometimes do this too:</p>
<p><em>There are now millions of cars on the road in most big cities. Pollution from cars is the most important problem that big cities face today.</em></p>
<p><em>To what extent do you agree or disagree?</em></p>
<p>The first sentence in this writing task presents a fact to support the argument being made in the second sentence - that this type of pollution is ‘<em>the most important</em>’ problem that big cities face.</p>
<section id="fact-and-opinion" class="level2" data-number="1.1">
<h2 data-number="1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fact-and-opinion"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Fact and opinion</h2>
<p>A fact is something that can be objectively measured and verified, while an argument or opinion cannot. In the test question, we know that the first sentence is a fact because we can verify it by counting the number of cars on the roads. We cannot verify the second statement because it is an opinion; we can only discuss it, and decide whether it is a valid argument or not. This is what our essay must do, which helps to explain why there is no right or wrong answer in task 2.</p>
<div class="callout callout-style-default callout-tip callout-titled">

<p>KEY IDEA: In writing task 2, you will be presented with an argument that you must discuss and respond to, there is no right or wrong answer. The question will sometimes include a fact that supports the argument being made. You do not need to discuss this fact, but you should not ignore it - it is there to make the context for your essay clear.</p>

<section id="perspective" class="level1" data-number="2">
<h1 data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Perspective</h1>
<p>It is important to be aware when we are writing about things that are universally, or generally true, and when we are writing about things that are only true for us. This matters for bigger ideas too - our city will not necessarily look the same as my city, and it will not operate by the same rules, which are based on our culture and history. Thus, our ideas on city living, and life in general, will reflect our own background and experiences, and when we are writing, we need to help the reader see these issues from our viewpoint. Perspective matters.</p>
<p><img src="https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/writing-task-2-5/Pasted image 20250904203437.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>To the person in these images, the tree and the house appear large or small, and easy to see or difficult to see, depending on where they are standing, and what is happening around them. This neatly illustrates the meaning of the terms viewpoint, point of view, and position. Thus, a rich person, who has always lived in a luxurious penthouse, will not have the same perspective on city life as a homeless person living in the same city. Similarly, someone with severe food allergies will not see the topic of food and diet in the same way as a person without these problems.</p>
<p>If we live in a city where the justice system is unfair, this will inevitably affect our opinions about this topic, so we need to explain the context for our argument when discussing this issue. If we are writing about traffic problems, and we live in a very busy city like Ho Chi Minh city, we need to help the examiner to see the problem as we see it - from our perspective. We can do this by explaining the context for our dieas</p>
<p><em>Crime and punishment are extremely emotive issues in my country, where …</em></p>
<p><em>The traffic in my city is …, so …</em></p>
<section id="language-note" class="level2" data-number="2.1">
<h2 data-number="2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="language-note"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Language note</h2>
<p>In academic writing, or when writing about a serious issue, we often begin by defining key terms. This can help to explain the context for the ideas in our argument. For example, if we are writing about the topic of ‘success’, we could begin by defining what this word means to us, or in our culture, which may be different to the examiner’s interpretation of the word.</p>
<p>Sometimes, we rephrase an idea in order to make it clearer. For example:</p>
<p><em>Many cities have more people than houses. This means that many people do not have anywhere to live.</em></p>
<p>In planning, we can use equals sign (=) to represent this:</p>
<p><em>Many cities have more people than houses = many people do not have anywhere to live.</em></p>
<p>Rephrasing the issue in this way help us to show a different way of looking at it; it changed the focus and helped to highlight how this issue affects the people involved. Other phrases that can be used like this are:</p>
<p><em>This means, … which means, … In other words, …</em></p>
<p>Whenever we use these phrases, what follows should be an explanation, or a different way to interpret what we have just said. However, the verb ‘to mean’ can also be used to show a consequence or result of something, like this:</p>
<p><em>Increasing house prices means fewer people can afford to buy a house.</em></p>
<p>When planning, we would use an arrow to show the connection between these ideas:</p>
<p>Increasing house prices -&gt; fewer people can afford to buy a house.</p>

<h3 data-number="2.1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="exercises"><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> Exercises</h3>
<p>In the following extracts how are the phrases ‘in other words’ or ‘this means’ being used?</p>

<td></td>
<td>ok</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In sentence 1, the writer is showing a different way of looking at the issue of having a lot of money.</p>
<p>In sentence 2, the problem may be one of vocabulary (the word ‘sincere’ is inaccurate here) but this is not an explanation of the previous sentence.</p>
<p>In sentence 3, the writer is showing two results or consequences of what happens when local businesses close.</p>
<p>In sentence 4, the second sentence is providing a reason for the previous sentence, so ‘This is because’ would be more accurate</p>

<section id="jumping-to-a-conclusion" class="level1" data-number="3">
<h1 data-number="3"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Jumping to a conclusion</h1>
<p>When candidates don’t allow enough time for critical thinking, they tend to jump to a conclusion that does not seem logical to the reader and so is rather confusing. The phrase ‘jump to a conclusion’ means reaching a quick decision when we don’t have all of the evidence we need, or before considering the evidence. Here is an example:</p>
<p><em>John has arrived late for work every day this week. Clearly, he is not committed to his job.</em></p>
<p>The first sentence is a verifiable fact - we can check the time that John arrived at work every day. However, the second sentence jumps to a conclusion about what this fact tells us about John’s attitude towards work. There are several reasons why John may be arriving late, such as problems with transport, a problem or illness at home, he may even arranged with his manager to stay late to finish an important project and start the day later than normal. The fact in the first sentence requires further investigation before a valid conclusion can be reached about what it means. Similarly, in the writing test, if we do not stop to think, we will not gather the evidence needed to reach a valid, logical conclusion that we can then explain clearly. Even more importantly, if we jump to a conclusion about what the test question means, then we are likely to lose marks for Task response.</p>
<p>Read the paragraph and try to guess what the topic of the writing task was.</p>
<p><em>First, let us consider the disadvantages of this trend towards driving more. If people drive more and more, our fossil fuels are likely to be depleted in the very near future. By 2050, it is estimated that human beings will have used up all of the natural resources if people keep using their vehicles more. Spending more time driving to work also means that people will have less time at work to do meaningful tasks. If it takes a person about 30 minutes to get to their destination, then they will lose approximately 15 hours a month. That invaluable amount of time could be better spend. In addition, the more time people spend driving, the more carbon emissions there will be in the atmosphere, which will further exacerbate our current environmental problems.</em></p>
<p>This is the topic he was asked to discuss:</p>
<p><em>Many people are now spending a lot of time traveling to work or school. Some people believe that this is a negative development while others think there are some benefits.</em></p>
<p>As we can see, driving is not mentioned in the question at all, but work is. This writer had spent a considerable amount of the paragraph explaining an issue that is not mentioned in the question (car driving and its impact on the environment), and then trying to connect this to the issue that <em>is</em> mentioned (work).</p>
<p>When PC asked why he had focused on cars and driving, he told that he lives in a very busy city, with major traffic problems, and where the vast majority of people drive to work or school every day. His perspective led him to interpret this question as, ‘everyone is now driving even more when traveling to work.’ In his city, the logical effects of this are that fossil fuels are being depleted, traffic is made worse, and work time is also being lost. Although we are being asked to use our own knowledge and experience to answer the question, the examiner needs help to be able to see the issue in the same way as we do.</p>
<p>What changes could you make to help the examiner see this candidate’s perspective more clearly? On our worksheet, try to rewrite the paragraph ourself so that the perspective is clear, and the argument is logically connected to the issue raised in the question.</p>
<p><em>First, let us consider the disadvantages of this trend. In my country, the vast majority of people drive to school or work. Therefore, if people are spending more time traveling, this means that they are also driving more and more. Because of this, our fossil fuels are likely to be depleted. In addition, the more people drive, the more carbon emissions there will be in the atmosphere, which will further exacerbate our current environmental problems. Spending more time driving to work and school also means that people will have less time to work on important tasks. If it takes a person about 30 minutes to get to their destination, then they will lose approximately 15 hours a month. That invaluable amount of time could be much better spend if people were abloe to shorten their journeys.</em></p>
<section id="points-to-notice" class="level2" data-number="3.1">
<h2 data-number="3.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="points-to-notice"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Points to notice</h2>
<ul>
<li>We can now understand the perspective and, as a result, the argument is clearer.</li>
<li>She used the phrases ‘In my country’ and ‘this means’ to show a different way of lokking at the issue raised in the question - one that reflects the perspective of the writer.</li>
<li>She has changed the order of some ideas so that they are organized more logically.</li>
<li>She cut this sentence: ‘<em>By 2050, it is estimated that human beings will have used up all of the natural resources if people keep using their vehicles more.</em>’ She did this because it is not necessary (the point about fossil fuels has already bene explained) and it is not directly connected to the original question. Going off on a tangent like this will reduce our Task response score.</li>

<h3 data-number="2.0.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="q18.-what-is-the-most-important-requirement-for-volunteers-at-the-festivals"><span class="header-section-number">2.0.1</span> <strong>Q18. What is the most important requirement for volunteers at the festivals?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Transcript extract:</strong></p>
<p><em>“We try to use volunteers who are flexible, though, because some festival events are held outdoors and the weather may affect the size of the audience and even whether the event can take place. So there can be changes at short notice.</em> <strong><em>What’s essential, though, is being able to get on well with other people and also to deal with someone who’s behaving badly, as occasionally happens.</em></strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Your answer:</strong> C (Flexibility)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Correct answer:</strong> A (Interpersonal skills)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>✅ <strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p>The speaker first <em>mentions flexibility</em> (and IELTS often puts distractors before the correct answer). But then comes the keyword <em>“What’s essential, though…”</em> which signals the true answer.</p>
<p>So, the test checks if you notice the contrast between <em>“try to use”</em> vs.&nbsp;<em>“What’s essential”</em>.</p>
<p>⚠️ <strong>Your mistake:</strong> You stopped at “flexibility” and treated it as the final answer. But IELTS often hides the real answer in the <em>second half</em> of the sentence with phrases like <em>“but, however, what’s essential, in fact”</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Transcript extract:</strong></p>
<p><em>“Our plan is to get your work in September</em> <strong><em>after a week’s training starting on the 2nd</em></strong>_. So, we’ll be timetabling you for duties_ <strong><em>the following week from the 9th onward.</em></strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Your answer:</strong> A (2 September)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Correct answer:</strong> B (9 September)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>✅ <strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p>The speaker mentions <em>training starts on the 2nd</em> (distractor), but the actual <em>start of work</em> is <em>the following week from the 9th onward</em>.</p>
<p>The key is the words <em>“after a week’s training”</em> → you don’t start on the 2nd, that’s only training.</p>
<p>⚠️ <strong>Your mistake:</strong> You focused on the first date you heard (Sept 2) instead of waiting for the sentence to finish. IELTS loves this “first date is training, second date is real start” trap. # Recording 3</p>

<section id="arguing-by-adding-information" class="level1" data-number="1">
<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Arguing by adding information</h1>
<p>The choice will depend on the ideas that occur to us when planning our essay - it cannot be decided in advance. This is because our ideas shape our argument, which then determines the language we must use. This cannot happen in reverse, beginning with the language, which is why a fixed template approach will not work.</p>
<p>When creating an argument:</p>
<p><img src="https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/writing-task-2-3/Pasted image 20250904165711.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>One way to build a clear argument is by presenting the different reasons that, when added together, led us to our conclusion. In our planning, we can use plus sign (+) to show arguments like this.</p>
<p>Words and phrases often used in this type or argument are:</p>
<p><strong>Firstly, Secondly, Thirdly, In addition, Similarly, also, etc.</strong></p>
<p>We will look at a model and use critical thinking to identity the ideas within the argument and to understand how the ideas are connected.</p>
<section id="practice" class="level3" data-number="1.0.1">
<h3 data-number="1.0.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="practice"><span class="header-section-number">1.0.1</span> Practice</h3>
<p>Look at the argument being made in the paragraph below and try to identify 3 points or ideas (PC’s conclusion) and 3 reasons given for believing them. (Mentally adding ‘because’, or ‘therefore’ can help us identify a reason or conclusion - this is helpful for IELTS reading too)</p>
<p><em>There are several reasons why the government collects taxes. Firstly, the money raised can be used to build new roads or public buildings. Secondly, existing infrastructure, such as schools and hospitals, can be updated or repaired. Finally, these funds are needed to pay the salaries of all government workers, including firefighters and the police. Thus, taxes help improve the community while also making it safer.</em></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The ‘evidence’ is the reason why her believe a conclusion is valid or reasonable, so the three reasons given in this paragraph are her supporting evidence. She used her experience and knowledge of the world to think of these, which is what the task tells us to do. The conclusions, or the points she make, are her personal views about what this evidence shows or tells us. Remember, each of these conclusions, or points, reveals her position on this issue - if the reasons she give to support are unclear or illogical (as we saw in the previous lesson), then her position and conclusions will also be unclear. If this evidence is missing, her ideas will be both unclear and undeveloped.</li>
<li>The points she make (her conclusion) are broad, general ideas (e.g.&nbsp;Taxes help make the community safer). In contrast, the reasons given are more specific, and they provide concrete supporting evidence to support her ideas (e.g.&nbsp;Taxes are used to pay the salaries of firefighters). Notice also that she was able to provide supporting evidence without using the phrases ‘For example’. We will review this idea in Lesson 6.</li>
<li>Notice her use of referencing in this paragraph (the way that she refer back to previous ideas). In the practice exercise, she used the word ‘taxes’ repeatedly, by if we look at her paragraph, we will see that she used synonyms to avoid repeating this word. This helps with our Coherence and cohesion score, and shows how building our vocabulary helps improve our writing score.</li>
</ol>
<p>Two words are used as synonyms to refer back to ‘taxes’: money, funds</p>
<p>Infrastructure refers to public services such as water, transport, rubbish collection etc.</p>
<p>Salaries refer to the money paid to workers. ## Adding emphasis</p>
<p>The language used in this argument tells the reader that each reason is equally important. However, we sometimes want to show that one reason is more important than the others, as in the following example.</p>
<p>There are several reasons why the government collects taxes. In terms of infrastructure, the money raised can be used to build new roads or public buildings, or to maintain existing structures such as schools and hospitals. <strong>More importantly,</strong> these funds are needed to pay the salaries of all government workers, including firefighters and the police. Thus, taxes <strong>not only</strong> help improve the community <strong>but also</strong> make it safer.</p>
<p>The phrases in bold are used to show her position, which can be summed up as: there are several good reasons for collecting taxes, and I believe that safety is the most important of these. Other phrases we may find useful when making an argument like this are:</p>
<p><strong>Moreover, Furthermore, What is more, Even more importantly.</strong></p>
<p>Notice that she did not use a connecting phrases between the first two sentences - the link between them is made clear through the use of referencing (‘the money raised’ refers back to ‘collects taxes’). As we have seen, some writers go even further, omitting even more connecting words and phrases. As well as removing clear signposting, this also creates a different tone in the writing, and sometimes goes too far.</p>
<p>Version 1:</p>
<p><em>There are several reasons why the government collects taxes. Firstly, the money raised can be used to build new roads or public buildings. Secondly, existing infrastructure, such as schools and hospitals, can be updated or repaired. Finally, these funds are needed to pay the salaries of all government workers, including firefighters and the police.</em></p>
<p>Version 2:</p>
<p><em>There are several reasons why the government collects taxes. The money raised can be used to build new roads or public buildings. Existing infrastructure, such as schools and hospitals, can be updated or repaired. The funds are needed to pay the salaries of all government workers, including firefighters and the police.</em></p>
<p>Second version is far more difficult for language learners to master.</p>
<p>In Version 2 the links are made clear through the use of synonyms (‘collects taxes’ in sentence 1 = ‘The money raised’ in sentence 2 and ‘these funds’ in sentence 3) The sentences are also connected through a common theme or context - each sentence provides a reason why the government collects taxes.</p>
<p>Something between these two:</p>
<p>Version 3:</p>
<p>There are several reasons why the government collects taxes. The money raised can be used to build new roads or public buildings. Existing infrastructure, such as schools and hospitals, can also be updated or repaired. Furthermore, the funds are needed to pay the salaries of all government workers, including firefighters and the police.</p>

<section id="arguing-by-showing-cause-and-effect" class="level1" data-number="2">
<h1 data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Arguing by showing cause and effect</h1>
<p>Rather than separate reasons added together, these arguments show that one idea has an impact on a second, and perhaps even a third, in a domino effect.</p>
<p>They are all connected, like links in a chain, which is why we also refer to this as a chain reaction. This type of argument helps explain that we believe something is a good or bad idea because of the effect it can have, and these provide the evidence in this type of argument. Generally, these arguments are based on facts or claims made by the writer, which may come from a claim made in the question itself or may be based on our own knowledge or experience.</p>
<p>In planning, we should use an arrow to show the connection between ideas in this kind of argument. Here are some examples of phrases that are often used to present an argument like this:</p>
<p><em>This means that …; This causes …; This can lead to …; As a result …; in turn; if … then …</em></p>
<section id="practice-2" class="level3" data-number="2.0.1">
<h3 data-number="2.0.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="practice-2"><span class="header-section-number">2.0.1</span> Practice</h3>
<p>Read the extract and identify the claim being made and three effects this has.</p>
<p>In many big cities, the population exceeds the number of flats and houses available, which means that many people do not have anywhere to live. This causes several problems. Firstly, it can put pressure on local charities, who then have to find food and shelter for the homeless.</p>
</section>
<section id="point-to-notice" class="level2" data-number="2.1">
<h2 data-number="2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="point-to-notice"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Point to notice</h2>
<p>This argument relies on her ability to clearly explain a complex problem: a lack of houses leads to increased homelessness, which then increases problems for local charities. A plan or map of this argument looks like this:</p>
<p>In many big cities the population exceeds the number of flats and house -&gt; many people do not have anywhere to love -&gt; puts pressure of local charities -&gt; charities have to find food and shelter for the homeless.</p>
<p>The complex chain of events forced her to produce complex grammatical structures. Complexity is not something we should aim to build into our writing through adding even more complex grammar points, creating overly long sentences, or using high-level vocabulary.</p>

<p>If you try to boost your score by writing long, complex sentences, the complex issues you are explaining will be confusing to the reader, and your argument will be impossible to follow. Explaining complex ideas in a clear and simple way will raise your chances of achieving band 7, not lower it.</p>

<section id="arguing-by-predicting-a-result-or-effect" class="level1" data-number="3">
<h1 data-number="3"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Arguing by predicting a result or effect</h1>
<p>We may want to prove that an action is good or bad by making a claim about the effect or result it <em>will, would, may,</em> or <em>could</em> have. in this type or argument, we are offering this predicted result as a reason why we believe it should, or should not, be allowed to happen. We may be sure of the result or effect of this action because we have direct experience of it, or we may be expressing a future concern, or making a possible prediction.</p>
<p>This type of argument uses the language of speculation, and such sentences often begin with ‘If’ or ‘When’. The language tells us how likely it is that the action will occur, and how confident the writer feels about the result of the action. Thus, when it is used accurately and appropriately, the language we use helps to make our position clear and, if it is used inaccurately, it can make our position less clear.</p>

<p>Many people try to use complex grammatical structures such as conditionals in their writing to boost their Grammatical range and accuracy score. However, this will only work if the structures are used accurately and appropriately - in other words, when they help to clearly explain your argument and your position.</p>

<section id="practice-3" class="level2" data-number="3.1">
<h2 data-number="3.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="practice-3"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Practice</h2>
<section id="q-1" class="level3" data-number="3.1.1">
<h3 data-number="3.1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="q-1"><span class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> Q 1</h3>
<p>In conditional sentences (using if or when), one clause is dependent on another clause happening first. We are essentially saying: If (or when) X happens / happened, Y will / would / may / might / could (etc.) happen / happens as a result.</p>
<p>We can see these two clauses as the action and the result, or effect, of this action.</p>
<p>The different tenses used tell us how likely these actions and results (or effects) are.</p>
<p>Look at the following sentences (1-6) and identify the action and the result.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If the government helps homeless people, this will solve all of their problems. (action: helps homeless people, result: all their problems are solved)</li>
<li>When homeless people are given free accommodation, their health often improves as a result. (action: give free accommodation to homeless people, result: improve their health)</li>
<li>If the government built more affordable housing, this could improve the situation for many people.</li>
<li>When homeless people have nowhere to shelter, winter is extremely difficult for them.</li>
<li>Very few people would be upset if taxes were increased to help the homeless.</li>
<li>If people are unemployed for a long time, they can eventually become homeless.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="q2" class="level3" data-number="3.1.2">
<h3 data-number="3.1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="q2"><span class="header-section-number">3.1.2</span> Q2</h3>
<p>Look at the tense used for each action in the sentences above and decide how likely it is to happen.</p>
<table class="caption-top table">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 48%">
<col style="width: 14%">
<col style="width: 14%">
<col style="width: 21%">

<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th></th>
<th>this happens in the real world</th>
<th>this is possible in the future</th>
<th>this is less likely to happen in the future</th>

</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>If the government helps homeless people, this will solve all of their problems.</td>
<td></td>
<td>ok</td>
<td></td>

<tr class="even">
<td>When homeless people are given free accommodation, their health often improves as a result.</td>

<td>ok</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>If people are unemployed for a long time, they can eventually become homeless.</td>
<td>ok</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Notice that the writer is telling us how likely these actions are through the use of the different tenses:</p>
<p>If + the simple present tells us this is possible in the future</p>
<p>When + the simple present tells us this generally happens (If can also be used in other way:)</p>
<p>If + simple past tells us the writer thinks this is less likely to happen.</p>
<p>For sentences 1 and 6, we need to consider both clauses. In sentence 1, the use of ‘will solve’ tells us the writer is presenting a possible future action in the first clause (‘if the government helps’). In sentence 6, the second clause (‘can eventually become’) tells us the writer is presenting a real situation and not an imagined one.</p>
</section>
<section id="q3" class="level3" data-number="3.1.3">
<h3 data-number="3.1.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="q3"><span class="header-section-number">3.1.3</span> Q3</h3>
<p>Now look at the tense used for each result. How sure does the writer feel about each result?</p>
<table class="caption-top table">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 75%">
<col style="width: 8%">
<col style="width: 7%">
<col style="width: 7%">

<tr class="odd">

<tr class="even">

<tr class="even">
<td>… they can eventually become homeless.</td>
<td>ok</td>
<td></td>
<td>ok</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>again, the tenses used tell us how confident or sure the writer feels about this result. In conditional sentences (where the result is dependent on a previous action): - the simple present, will, and would all tell us the writer is 100% sure that this will / would result - the modal verbs may, could, might tell us the writer is only 50% sure, or sees this as just one possible result - adverbs (e.g.&nbsp;probably) and phrases such as ‘is likely to’ can be used to show 75% certainty that a result would or will probably happen or is likely to happen.</p>
<p>Being cautious</p>
<p>If the government helps homeless people, this … solve … of their problems.</p>
<p>…, this could/ may /might/ is likely to solve many/ some/ most of their problems.</p>

</section>
<section id="points-to-notice-about-conditional-sentences" class="level2" data-number="3.2">
<h2 data-number="3.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="points-to-notice-about-conditional-sentences"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Points to notice about conditional sentences</h2>
<ul>
<li>The likely <strong>actions</strong> are i the simple present, and use if or when</li>
<li>The <strong>less likely / unlikely actions</strong> use the simple past.</li>
<li>The less certain results use <strong>may / could / possibly</strong> / etc.</li>
<li>The 100% sure results use <strong>will, would</strong>, or <strong>the simple present</strong></li>
<li>Remember, these sentences require 2 clauses, and one clause (B) is ‘conditional’ upon the other (A).</li>
<li>We can say: ‘If A happens then B will result’. This is a very firm prediction about the result.</li>
<li>We can also say: ‘If A happened then B would result’. Although the first event is less likely to happen, we are still making a firm prediction about the result. We are saying that ‘A’ is less certain (it may not happen), but if it <strong>DID</strong> happen, then B <strong>would definitely</strong> result from this.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first sentence from this exercise makes a very strong prediction about the result of the government’s action</p>
<p><em>If the government helps homeless people, this will solve all of their problems.</em></p>
<p>It is highly unlikely that all of the problems that homeless people face will definitely be solved in this way. In formal writing, it is better to be more cautious about claims or predictions that we make. The language used to show this is known has ‘hedging language’, and it is important in making an argument and in making our position clear.</p>
<p><img src="https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/writing-task-2-3/Pasted image 20250904181229.png" class="img-fluid"> • To practise further, look through any of your previous essays and scan your writing for the following words and phrases: If, when, as a result, result in, causes, will, would, could, might. • Look carefully at the arguments you made using these words — is your position clear? Does the tense or verb accurately reflect how sure you feel about the result? (Think about your use of conditionals and modal verbs.) Make a note of any grammar points you need to study and make sure to practise these often. • If you have written any essays based on questions asking you to discuss the problems and solutions or the causes and effects of a problem, look at the body paragraphs in your essay and think about the following: • Can you Identify any claims you have made and the effects that you discussed? • How are the ideas in your argument connected? • How did you show this connection? • What improvements can you make?</p>

<p>Candidates at C1 and C2 (bands 7 to 9) have mastered the language from A1 to C2; they use high-level language accurately and only at the appropriate time. You will show C1 and C2 skills by clearly explaining a complex argument, not by using as much high-level grammar or vocabulary as possible.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>We can provide strong reasoning or give extra support for an idea by making a point a bout a contrasting idea or argument. This can be a useful way of finding extra ideas when we are stuck. To get ideas like this, ask ourseves, ‘<em>What would happen if we <u>didn’t</u> have / <u>do</u> this?</em>’ or ‘<em>What happens when we <u>don’t</u> have / <u>do</u> this?</em>’ For example, ’What happens if the government <u>doesn’t </u>help poor people.</p>
<p>This type of argument can be useful when writing about whether a development is positive or negative. The words and phrases we might find in this type of argument are:</p>
<p><strong>If … does not … then; Without … ,</strong></p>
<p>Look at the following example:</p>
<p><em>In many big cities, the population exceeds the number of flats and houses available, which means that many people do not have anywhere to live. This causes several problems. Firstly, it can put pressure on local charities, who have to find food and shelter for the homeless. If the government does not step in to help people who are struggling financially, then this puts even more stress on community programs, and causes homelessness to rise even further.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>The tenses used here (the simple present and the conditional) indicate that the writer has some experience or knowledge of this topic, and feels very confident that these effects <em>will</em> happen. Remember, if we are less certain, we can show this by using modal verbs (can, may etc) like this</li>
</ul>
<p>If the government does not step in to help people who are struggling financially, then this can put even more stress on community programs, and may cause homelessness to rise even further</p>

<li>The same language is useful in presenting a counterargument.</li>

<h1 data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Combining different types of arguments</h1>
<p>At the moment, our paragraph is quite short. However, if we want to add another negative effect resulting from a lack of housing, we need to be very careful. A common mistake at band 6 is to simply add a new idea, like the final sentence in this extract:</p>
<p><img src="https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/writing-task-2-4/Pasted image 20250904182248.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The final sentence here creates a referencing problem - the pronoun ‘it’ confuses the reader, and so the conclusion becomes unclear. A pronoun generally refers back to the last noun or idea mentioned, which in this case is either the rise in homelessness, or ‘If the government does not step in to help people.’</p>
<p><img src="https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/writing-task-2-4/Pasted image 20250904182419.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The reader understands this as</p>
<p>If the government does not step into help people who are struggling financially, this means that house prices and rents remain very high.</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>If homelessness rises further, this means that house prices and rents remain very high.</p>
<p>In both cases, the link between these ideas is not clear, so a referencing problem like this often results in a band 6 ‘unclear conclusion’.</p>
<p>The writer actually intended to add another negative effect of the issue mentioned in the first sentence of this paragraph and make the following more logical argument:</p>
<p>‘When the population exceeds the number of houses and flats available, this makes house prices high’.</p>
<p>To show that we are adding a new point to a much earlier idea, we need to use a synonym or paraphrase to refer back, like this.</p>
<p>‘In addition, a lack of accommodation means that house prices and rents remain very high.’</p>
<p>Using paraphrase or a synonym rather than a pronoun to refer back to an earlier part of the paragraph clearly signals which 2 ideals are being linked by the connection phrases. ‘In addition.’ Look out for this type of referencing in the IELTS reading test too.</p>

<p>Which of the following points would follow on logically to conclude our paragraph?</p>
<p>Thus, housing problems have an impact on everyone in the community.</p>
<p>Thus, houses are likely to become even more expensive in the future.</p>
<p>Thus, employment is also a very important issue.</p>
<p>Thus, the government is not responsible for housing problems.</p>
<p>1 <img src="https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/writing-task-2-4/Pasted image 20250904183157.png" class="img-fluid"> # Joining ideas together to vary sentence length</p>
<p>High-level writers show an awareness of style, and try to vary the length of their sentences. Using a mixture of long and shorter sentences makes reading easier and also makes our writing less repetitive.</p>
<p><em>In many big cities, the population exceeds the number of flats and houses available, which means that many people do not have anywhere to live. This causes several problems. Firstly, it can put pressure on local charities, who have to find food and shelter for the homeless. If the government does not step in to help people who are struggling financially, then this puts even more stress on community programmes, and causes homelessness to rise even further. In addition, a lack of accommodation means that house prices and rents remain very high. Thus, housing problems have an impact on everyone in the community.</em></p>
<p>The first sentence of the paragraph makes a claim, and the remaining sentences either explain the effects of this claim, or a reaching conclusion about what these effects tell us. Remember, the effects can be seen as the supporting evidence or reasoning in this type of argument.</p>

<p>As this image shows, this is a very complex argument. It combines arguing by showing cause and effect, arguing by showing contrast, and arguing by adding information. Because of this complexity, there is a greater chance of language errors, and it is particularly difficult to explain the progression of the argument clearly and simply. When planning, we need to be aware of how complex our argument is before begin writing so that we can take extra care when connecting our ides, particularly when referring back to a much earlier idea.</p>

  <title>GRE Verbal Practice</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Although the film is rightly judged imperfected by most of today’s critics, the film being created today are … it, since its release in 1940 provoked sufficient critical discussion to enhance the intellectual respectively of cinema considerably.</p>
<p>A beholden to</p>
<p>B in debted to</p>
<p>C derivate of</p>
<p>D based on</p>
<p>E distinguishable from</p>
<p>F biased against</p>
<p><img src="https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/gre-verbal-practice/Pasted image 20250902174949.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Step 1: Logic</p>
<p>The sentence contrast two ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>The 1940 film is imperfect. (negative)</li>
<li>Despite this, it had an important influence on films today (positive).</li>
</ul>
<p>So, the blank must mean “owe something to / influenced by”.</p>
<p>Step 2: Options</p>
<p>A beholden to -&gt; means “indebted to” (slightly archaic but valid) B indebted to -&gt; directly means “owe something to” C derivative of -&gt; means “copied from” (too strong slightly off) D based on -&gt; possible, but usually used for content/story, not influence E distinguishable from -&gt; opposite meaning F biased against -&gt; opposite meaning</p>
<p>Step 3: Best fit</p>
<p>the correct sense: today’s films owe something to that 1940 film.</p>
<p>So the best choice is:</p>
<p>B/ indebted to</p>
<p>(A. beholden to could also work in older/literary phrasing, but GRE prefers the more standard form).</p>

  <title>Practice Writing Task 1</title>

<p><img src="https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/w1-pie/Pasted image 20250901114900.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The three pie charts compare the proportions of five categories of books sold by a bookseller in 1972, 1992, and 2012.</p>
<p>Overall, adult fiction rose dramatically to dominate sales by the end of the period, whereas biography and the residual “others” category both contracted sharply. Children’s titles edged up slightly, while travel books first gained ground and then fell back.</p>
<p>In 1972, sales were fairly balanced: adult fiction, children’s fiction and biography each accounted for 20%, with travel on 15% and others the single largest segment at 25%. By 1992, adult fiction had become the clear leader at 25%, children’s books stood at 22%, and travel rose to 18%. In contrast, biography slipped to 15%, and others declined to 20%.</p>
<p>The most pronounced change occurred over the following two decades. Adult fiction more than doubled its share, surging to 45% in 2012. Children’s fiction continued a modest upward trajectory to 25%, placing it second. By comparison, travel’s slice nearly halved to 10%, biography fell even more steeply to 8%, and others shrank to 12%. Consequently, by 2012, the market had become far less even, with adult fiction alone representing almost half of all books sold.</p>

<li><p>Trap: The phrase “touring professionals” + “professional stringer” tempts you to connect them, but IELTS checks if it’s explicitly stated.</p></li>
<li><p>Since text only mentions stringing is important, <strong>frequency / most players / taking stringers on tour</strong> is NOT GIVEN.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lesson:</strong> If the text does not <strong>quantify</strong> (most, many, few, all) → answer = NOT GIVEN.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>“…much of the serving power of US professional player Pete Sampras was attributed to the addition of four to five lead weights onto his rackets.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>IELTS expects <strong>exact word form</strong>: the blank requires a <strong>noun</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>In the passage, the phrase = “lead weights”. If you only write “lead”, you miss the <strong>object</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Trap: IELTS often tests <strong>precision</strong> → e.g., “metal <em>weights</em>” vs “metal”.</p></li>
<li><p>Also, “lead” alone doesn’t answer the question “Metal ___ ?” → correct noun = <strong>weights</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lesson:</strong> In completion tasks:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Always check the <strong>grammar of the blank</strong> (singular/plural, countable/uncountable).</p></li>
<li><p>Copy exactly from passage, but make sure it <strong>fits grammatically</strong> in the sentence.</p></li>

<h1 data-number="4"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> <strong>Top traps in Passage 2 (Pirates)</strong></h1>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Paraphrase trap</strong> — the text rarely repeats keywords from the question. The question may use a synonym or different grammatical form.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em> “eradicate piracy” → question uses “campaign to eradicate” or “how a campaign was carried out.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Chronology / reference trap</strong> — several paragraphs describe similar events at different times (Egypt, Greece, Rome). It’s easy to map the idea to the wrong paragraph if you don’t check the time/place signals.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implies vs states</strong> — the passage often <strong>implies</strong> motives (e.g.&nbsp;economy improved) without saying exactly what the question asks; watch for explicit phrasing. If the passage <em>implies</em> but does not <em>state</em> something, it can be a NOT GIVEN or wrong-match trap.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Detail displacement</strong> — many paragraphs contain several facts; the correct answer will be tied to one particular sentence. The distractor typically appears nearby, using a related idea. Read full sentence, not just phrase.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Multiple-use” paragraphs</strong> — a paragraph may support more than one question; this is normal. Don’t eliminate a paragraph after you use it once.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Plural / word-form trap</strong> in summaries — the exam often requires one-word answers. Make sure you copy the <strong>exact noun</strong> form that fits the gap (e.g., <strong>GRAIN</strong> not “grain ships”).</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Time markers</strong> (BCE dates, “By the 1st century BCE,” “In 67 BCE”) → map to Rome / Pompey.</p></li>

<p><strong>Correct: A – It may at some point provide us with a solution to misinformation.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Why A is right:</strong> The text says the means to correct misinformation <strong>“might, over time, be found in those same patterns of mass communication.”</strong> That’s a cautious, future-oriented <em>may/might</em> claim.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Common trap:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>D</strong> (“made it easier to check accuracy”) is <strong>not</strong> stated. No claim about fact-checking ease.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>B/C</strong> change the meaning: no claim about altering how people regard information (B) or how organisations use misinformation (C).</p></li>

<p><strong>Correct: C – Outlining which issues connected with misinformation are significant today.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Why C is right:</strong> The paragraph introduces <strong>“at least three observations… warrant the attention of researchers, policy makers, and everyone,”</strong> then lists them (initial belief, lack of blocking, costly correction). That’s a <strong>menu of key issues</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Common trap:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Correct: J – different ideas.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Why J is right:</strong> The text: <strong>“conflicting predictions”</strong> from the two philosophers. That paraphrases to <strong>“different ideas”</strong> about engagement with information.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Common trap:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A</strong> (“constant conflict”) misreads “conflicting predictions.” The philosophers aren’t fighting; their <strong>theories</strong> conflict. “Constant” isn’t in the text.</li>

<ul>
<li>Choosing <strong>NO</strong> because you <em>assume</em> it’s supported; but NO requires a <strong>clear contradiction</strong> (“it has <strong>not</strong> been opposed”). We don’t have that.</li>

<ul>
<li><p>You answered <strong>C</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Correct answer is <strong>F</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Paragraph <strong>C</strong> talks about perfectionists, low self-esteem, and avoiding judgment. It explains <em>who procrastinates</em> and <em>why</em>, but it never mentions realizing that <em>other people</em> also do it.</p></li>
<li><p>Paragraph <strong>F</strong>, at the end, says:</p>
<p><em>“We should remind ourselves that we’re not the first person to procrastinate, nor the last.”</em></p>
<p>→ This is exactly the “realisation that others also procrastinate.”</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> When the question asks about “realisation” or “awareness,” look for <em>mental attitude shifts</em> (not causes).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You answered <strong>D</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Correct answers are <strong>A and E</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Paragraph <strong>F</strong> gives the strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>“Forgiving ourselves and feeling compassion when we procrastinate…”</em> → That’s <strong>A (not judging ourselves harshly)</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>“…strategies that can help us fend off distractions that can occupy our minds when we should be focusing…”</em> → That’s <strong>E (avoiding things that stop us concentrating)</strong>.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>D (prioritising tasks)</strong> is <em>not</em> mentioned anywhere. It looks tempting because it feels logical, but IELTS traps you by including “reasonable but not in the text” options.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Always match answers <em>word-for-word</em> with evidence in the passage. If the text doesn’t mention it, it’s wrong — even if it sounds logical.</p>
<hr>
<p>✅ <strong>Summary of mistakes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Q15</strong>: Chose the wrong paragraph because you focused on causes of procrastination instead of the “realisation.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Q26</strong>: Fell into the “logical but not in the text” trap. # Part 3</p></li>

<p><strong>Paragraph A</strong></p>
<p>Many people believe stress comes mainly from external pressure, such as work deadlines. However, recent studies show that stress often arises from how we <em>interpret</em> events. If two people face the same challenge, one may feel anxious, while the other feels motivated.</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph B</strong></p>
<p>Researchers also discovered that people who openly share their worries with others tend to recover faster from stressful events. By realising they are not alone, they reduce feelings of isolation. This awareness has been shown to lower stress hormones.</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph C</strong></p>
<p>Although physical exercise is usually promoted for fitness, it also reduces stress. Exercise stimulates the release of chemicals in the brain that improve mood. For this reason, many doctors recommend regular activity to patients with high stress levels.</p>

<section id="performance-summary" class="level1" data-number="1">
<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Performance summary</h1>
<p>Correct: 38/40</p>
</section>
<section id="recording-1" class="level1" data-number="2">
<h1 data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Recording 1</h1>
<section id="q3-you-wrote-insects-correct-answer-data" class="level2" data-number="2.1">
<h2 data-number="2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="q3-you-wrote-insects-correct-answer-data"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> <strong>Q3 (you wrote</strong>&nbsp; <strong>INSECTS</strong>&nbsp;<strong>— correct answer</strong>&nbsp;<strong>DATA</strong>*)**</h2>
<p><strong>Where it appears in the recording:</strong> “They also collect and analyse <strong>data</strong> about the things they see.”</p>
<p><strong>Why DATA is correct:</strong> the verbs <em>collect and analyse</em> naturally collocate with <em>data</em> (you collect/record data, not collect insects in this context).</p>
<p><strong>Why you were tempted:</strong> earlier the speaker mentions <em>birds and insects</em> in the list of wildlife, and the science activity also involves plants and insects — it’s easy to grab a nearby noun instead of the object of the verb phrase.</p>
<p><strong>How to avoid it:</strong> focus on the <strong>verb + object</strong> pair. When you hear <em>collect / analyse</em>, expect a <strong>non-count / abstract noun</strong> (data / information / evidence) rather than a concrete species name. Train yourself to listen one or two words after the verb phrase to catch the direct object.</p>
</section>
<section id="q7-discovery---freedom" class="level2" data-number="2.2">
<h2 data-number="2.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="q7-discovery---freedom"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Q7 DISCOVERY -&gt; FREEDOM</h2>
<p><strong>Where it appears in the recording:</strong> “I would imagine they get a sense of <strong>freedom</strong> that might not be a normal part of their lives.”</p>
<p><strong>Why FREEDOM is correct:</strong> the exact phrase is <em>a sense of freedom</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Why you were tempted:</strong> the paragraph earlier uses <em>explore and discover</em>, so <em>discovery</em> feels topically relevant and was in your short-term memory.</p>
<p><strong>How to avoid it:</strong> watch for <strong>fixed expressions</strong> such as <em>a sense of </em>___. If the speaker uses <em>a sense of …</em>, the missing word is usually an abstract state (freedom, independence, belonging). Also, when you hear the pattern “I would imagine they get a sense of …”, slow down in your head and expect one concrete abstract noun — not a gerund or verbal noun derived from the previous sentence.</p>
</section>
<section id="q10-leader---leaders" class="level2" data-number="2.3">
<h2 data-number="2.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="q10-leader---leaders"><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Q10 LEADER -&gt; LEADERS</h2>
<p><strong>Where it appears in the recording:</strong> “There’s no charge for <strong>leaders</strong> and other adults - as many as you want to bring.”</p>
<p><strong>Why LEADERS (plural) is correct:</strong> the phrase <em>as many as you want</em> makes clear the plural; the recording explicitly uses <em>leaders</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Why you were tempted:</strong> hearing the single word <em>leader</em> in isolation (or reading the question fragment quickly) can look plausible, but it fails the grammar/number test.</p>
<p><strong>How to avoid it:</strong> check <strong>number signals</strong> in the sentence (as many / each / every / a / the). If the context allows more than one, answer must be plural. For summary completion always re-read the sentence mentally with your candidate word: does it fit grammatically?</p>

<section id="quick-practice-drills-2-minutes" class="level2" data-number="2.4">
<h2 data-number="2.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="quick-practice-drills-2-minutes"><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> <strong>Quick practice drills (2 minutes)</strong></h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Hear the verb <strong>“collect and analyse”</strong> → supply the noun that collocates (answer: <strong>data</strong>).</p></li>
<li><p>Hear the phrase <strong>“a sense of …”</strong> → think of abstract nouns that fit (freedom, pride, belonging). Practice choosing the one that fits the passage meaning.</p></li>
<li><p>Hear <strong>“as many as …”</strong> or <strong>“each”</strong> → force yourself to write plural vs singular appropriately (leaders ≠ leader</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Look again at the original sentence from the recording:</p>
<p><em>“There’s no charge for</em> <strong><em>leaders</em></strong> <em>and other</em> <strong><em>adults</em></strong> <em>— as many as you want to bring.”</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The word <strong>adults</strong> is plural, and it’s paired with <strong>leaders</strong> in the same structure.</p></li>
<li><p>In English, when two nouns are linked with <strong>and</strong> in a parallel list, they normally match in number and form.</p></li>
<li><p>If it were singular, the sentence would be odd: <em>“no charge for leader and other adults”</em> — imbalance.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So yes, <strong>ADULTS</strong> works as a <strong>plural signal</strong> for the missing word.</p>

<h3 data-number="2.4.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="strategy-tip"><span class="header-section-number">2.4.1</span> <strong>Strategy tip:</strong></h3>
<p>When filling blanks in IELTS <strong>sentence completion</strong>, always:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Look <strong>left and right</strong> of the blank for number cues (plural nouns, “as many as,” “other,” “these”).</p></li>
<li><p>Match your word form to those cues — IELTS often plants the singular/plural trap.</p></li>

<section id="performance-summary" class="level1" data-number="1">
<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Performance summary</h1>
<p>Correct: 38/40</p>
</section>

<section id="mistake-4" class="level3" data-number="2.0.1">
<h3 data-number="2.0.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mistake-4"><span class="header-section-number">2.0.1</span> <strong>❌ Mistake 4</strong></h3>
<p>You wrote: <strong>APPOINTMENT</strong></p>
<p>Correct answer: <strong>APPOINTMENTS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The audio says: <em>“making appointments, whether face to face or on the phone.”</em></p></li>
<li><p>IELTS needs you to capture <strong>plural vs.&nbsp;singular</strong> exactly.</p></li>
<li><p>You missed the <strong>-s</strong>, which is a common trap.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fix:</strong></p>
<p>👉 Train your ear for <strong>plural endings</strong> (“-s” / “-z” sounds). In notes, underline plural nouns during practice.</p>
<p>Yes, you can <strong>logically know</strong> that the answer (No.&nbsp;4) must be <strong>plural</strong>, because of the pronoun <em>“them”</em> in the phrase:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>_“…making 4 _______ and reorganising_ <strong><em>them</em></strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If it were singular, the sentence would need <em>“it”</em>, not <em>“them.”</em></p>
<p>So even if you mishear or miss the <strong>-s</strong> sound in <em>appointments</em>, the <strong>grammar clue</strong> (them = plural) tells you the correct form must be plural.</p>
</section>
<section id="ielts-strategy" class="level3" data-number="2.0.2">
<h3 data-number="2.0.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ielts-strategy"><span class="header-section-number">2.0.2</span> ** IELTS Strategy**</h3>
<p>When filling gaps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Listen carefully first</strong> → try to catch the sound.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Check grammar around the blank</strong> → pronouns, verbs, determiners often reveal whether it’s plural, singular, past tense, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Confirm spelling &amp; form</strong> → IELTS marks strictly. <em>Appointment</em> ≠ <em>appointments</em>.</p></li>
</ol>

<section id="mistake-9" class="level3" data-number="2.0.3">
<h3 data-number="2.0.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mistake-9"><span class="header-section-number">2.0.3</span> <strong>❌ Mistake 9</strong></h3>
<p>You wrote: <strong>1:50</strong></p>
<p>Correct answer: <strong>1.15</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The audio says clearly: <em>“What time would I finish? – One fifteen.”</em></p></li>
<li><p>Probably confusion because “fifty” and “fifteen” sound similar in fast speech. IELTS <strong>loves this trap</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fix:</strong></p>
<p>👉 Strategy:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Pay attention to <strong>teen vs.&nbsp;ty endings</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>fifteen</em> = stress on the <strong>second syllable</strong></p></li>
<li><p><em>fifty</em> = stress on the <strong>first syllable</strong></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>During listening practice, shadow numbers (13/30, 15/50, etc.) until you instantly distinguish them.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Audio said:</strong> “<em>The instructions were to</em> <strong><em>capture the clouds</em></strong> <em>as well — it couldn’t just be blue sky and a setting sun.</em>”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Table prompt:</strong> “<em>Scene must show some </em>______”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Grammar clue:</strong> “<strong>some</strong>” + <strong>countable noun</strong> → plural form. If it were singular, it would be <strong>“a cloud”</strong>; with “some,” it must be <strong>“clouds.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Why it’s easy to miss:</strong> The final <strong>/z/</strong> in “clouds” is short and can be swallowed in natural speech, especially before a consonant. Under time pressure, it’s common to write the base form.</p></li>
</ul>

<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Use the prompt grammar:</strong> When you see **“some ___,”** pre-decide it will be <strong>plural</strong> (or an uncountable noun). For sunsets, the natural collocation is <strong>“some clouds.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Listen for plural cues in the audio:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Determiner: <strong>“some”</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Verb agreement: <strong>“were”</strong> (if used)</p></li>
<li><p>Pronouns: <strong>“they/them”</strong> referring back</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Mark a quick “S?” in the margin</strong> when you spot “some/many/few/these/those.” Confirm during the replay/check window.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pre-activate likely vocabulary:</strong> For “sunsets,” anticipate <strong>clouds / cloud cover / horizon / silhouettes</strong>. When you expect “clouds,” you’re more likely to catch the plural.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Micro-listening practice:</strong> Train your ear for final consonant clusters <strong>/dz/</strong> (e.g., <strong>clouds, birds, roads</strong>). Say them aloud to feel the plural.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>“<strong>you should never consume mushrooms picked by friends or neighbours</strong> — always remember that some poisonous mushrooms look very similar to edible ones…” → maps to <strong>C</strong> (“Don’t eat mushrooms given to you”).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>You may have <strong>over-generalised</strong> “don’t eat” instructions and misread the target: Dan warns <em>against consuming others’ picks</em>, not against eating while you pick (D).</p></li>
<li><p>In exam pressure, short negative words (“never”, “avoid”) can blur; you heard the caution but not the <strong>object</strong> (who picked them).</p></li>

<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Listen for the direct object</strong> after negation words: when you hear <em>never / avoid / don’t</em>, ask immediately <strong>“who/what?”</strong> — e.g., <em>never consume</em> <strong><em>mushrooms picked by friends</em></strong> <em>→ answer refers to mushrooms given by others (C)</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Annotate differences in the margin:</strong> write a short code for the object: e.g., never consume (others) vs avoid (roads). This avoids confusing “don’t eat” with “don’t eat while…”.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Predict likely paraphrases</strong>: “mushrooms picked by friends” → “mushrooms given to you.” If an option paraphrases that, flag it.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Dan mentions apps positively earlier, so if you latch on to the first useful-sounding item, you may select <strong>A</strong> (use an app) without hearing the concluding recommendation.</p></li>

<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Listen for recommendation signals</strong>: <em>“you should…”, “I wouldn’t recommend…”, “if possible, …”</em> — these mark the final preferred action.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>When multiple options are mentioned, prefer the speaker’s final advice.</strong> Flag earlier options as “possible but limited” if hedging language appears (e.g., “but…”, “however”).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Note contrast markers</strong>: “I wouldn’t recommend X… There are some good apps, but… If possible, you should Y.” The contrast shifts to the correct choice.</p></li>

<p>Read each short excerpt (imagined speech). Which is the recommended action?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When you hear <strong>warnings/advice</strong>, mark the exact <strong>object</strong> of the warning (who/what/where).</p></li>
<li><p>Underline the <strong>modal phrase</strong> that expresses recommendation: <em>should / must / wouldn’t recommend / never</em>. The sentence containing that modal is usually the answer.</p></li>
<li><p>If several options are mentioned, <strong>prefer the speaker’s final recommendation</strong> unless the question asks for “mentioned” rather than “recommended”.</p></li>
<li><p>When options paraphrase the same idea, map synonyms in your head: <em>“picked by friends” → “given to you”</em>.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Listen for <strong>“never”</strong> or <strong>“avoid”</strong> followed by the <strong>object</strong> (what is forbidden).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Over-generalisation:</strong> letting prior knowledge or assumptions about the Luddites replace what the speakers actually said.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Missing both items:</strong> in a “choose TWO” question some candidates only find one relevant detail and then guess a plausible second (often from background knowledge).</p></li>

<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Listen for exact opinion signals.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Words/phrases that indicate judgment: <em>“they didn’t achieve anything”, “was ineffective”, “that didn’t work”.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Words that indicate empathy: <em>“I see why…”, “I can understand”, “I’d have felt the same”.</em></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Map phrase → option immediately.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>When you hear <em>“they didn’t achieve anything”</em> write shorthand: <strong>ineffective → A</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>When you hear <em>“I see why… felt threatened”</em> write <strong>understandable → E</strong>.</p>
<p>This removes the need to remember exact wording later.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>If the question asks for TWO, force yourself to find TWO distinct lines.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t stop after the first match. Keep listening and look for a second explicit opinion (not implied).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Ignore prior knowledge</strong> — focus strictly on what the speakers actually say in the recording.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use short symbols while listening:</strong> J (judgement), S (sympathy), F (fact). Then match them to options. Example: when you hear J → look for option meaning “ineffective”; when S → look for option meaning “understandable.”</p></li>

<p>Read each mini-excerpt and pick the correct opinion option(s) (A–E). Answers at the end.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Speaker A: “They tried hard, but in the end it changed nothing.”</p>
<p>Speaker B: “Still, I can see why they panicked.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Which TWO? → __________</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Speaker A: “This movement actually inspired much later legislation.”</p>
<p>Speaker B: “No, that’s exaggerated.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Which TWO? → __________</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Speaker A: “They were violent and broke equipment.”</p>
<p>Speaker B: “It’s easy to criticise them now, but their fears were real.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Which TWO? → __________</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answers:</strong> 1 → A &amp; E (ineffective; understandable).</p>

<p>3 → (A? or C?) Actually A = ineffective (not directly), C = unfair criticism? This item shows you must match exact wording — the safe mapping is E (understandable) and possibly none of the others — again don’t guess.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Which TWO opinions about the Luddites do the students express?</p>
<p><strong>Options:</strong></p>
<p>A. Their actions were ineffective.</p>
<p>B. They are still influential today.</p>
<p>C. They have received unfair criticism.</p>
<p>D. They were proved right.</p>
<p>E. Their attitude is understandable.</p>
<p><strong>Transcript references:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>“With those protesting workers called the Luddites destroying their knitting machines because they were so worried about losing their jobs.”</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>“Yes, and ultimately, they didn’t achieve anything.”</em> → <strong>A (ineffective)</strong></p></li>
<li><p><em>“Yes, that’s true — but it probably didn’t seem a positive thing at the time. I see why the Luddites felt so threatened.”</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>“I know. I’m sure I would have felt the same.”</em> → <strong>E (attitude is understandable)</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> <strong>21–22 → A, E</strong></p>
<p><strong>Trap:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Option <strong>B (still influential)</strong> looks attractive because of historical importance, but the speakers never say the Luddites influenced today.</p></li>
<li><p>Option <strong>D (proved right)</strong> is also tempting, but they explicitly said <em>“industrialisation created more jobs than it destroyed.”</em></p></li>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><strong>Topic:</strong> snacks</p>
<p><strong>Themes:</strong> Diet, health, lifestyle, habits</p>
<p><strong>Personal / Local</strong>: Present: These days, I usually snack on roasted peanuts or fruit because they’re healthier, but when I feel stressed with studying, I can’t resist ice cream with my girlfriend. I don’t eat any fast food or have sugary drinks at all.</p>
<p>Habits / preferences / like / dislikes:</p>
<p>I love chocolate, but I mostly eat dark chocolate because it has less sugar. If I do snacks, I have something protein-based or vegetable.</p>
<p>Past:</p>
<p>I used to snack a lot when I was working – especially in the afternoons. Back then, I could eat whatever I wanted without putting on weight, but eventually, it caught up with me and I gained weight, so I stopped.</p>
<p>Near future:</p>
<p>I don’t plan to change my current snack habits, but I know many people will still consume too much sugar to get a quick energy boost.</p>
<p><strong>Key memories:</strong></p>
<p>I associate that snack with my time spent with my girlfriend, sometimes we buy groceries in the supermarket and eat ice cream or French fries together.</p>
<p>When I was in high school, I often stayed up late playing computer games with friends. We always had chips and soda beside us, and at that time, I didn’t really care about health. Now when I see that brand of chips, it reminds me of those nights.</p>

<p>Some answers to this question reveal a common problem with data tasks: drawing the wrong conclusions about what the data tell us. As we saw in lessons 1 and 3, this can present problems for TA score.</p>
<p>To understand the issue, think about where the data in the bar chart has come from. Data about people and how they live generally comes from some sort of survey, where people answer personal questions. Our current data would be based on the answer to <strong>one question</strong>.</p>
<p>Which of the following questions could have produced the data in the bar chart above?</p>
<p>A. <em>Are you planning to buy or rent a house in the future?</em></p>
<p>B. <em>Where do you live now?</em></p>
<p>C. Do you live in a house or a flat?</p>
<p>D. Do you rent or own your home?</p>
<p>E. Would you prefer to own a home or rent?</p>
<p>F. Where did you live before you moved to this house</p>
<p>The only question that fits the data in this charts is Option D: <em>Do you rent or own your home?</em></p>
<p>This means we do not have any information about where people moved from, or what their living preferences are. Yet some people write sentences like this:</p>
<p>It is clear from the chart that <font color="#ff0000">owned accommodation</font> become <font color="#ff0000">more popular</font> in the final 4 decades.</p>
<p>To be able to say that something is ‘<em>more popular</em>’, we would need to ask a different question in the survey in the survey. With our current data, we can only say that home ownership was <font color="#245bdb">more common</font> in the later years. We do not know if the people concerned <font color="#ff0000">preferred</font> or <font color="#ff0000">chose</font> to rent - they may have been forced through circumstances (e.g.&nbsp;a lack of money or job). If homelessness was increasing, we would not say that it was becoming ‘<em>more popular</em>’.</p>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Always think about what the data actually tells us - what question does it answer? Avoid using the words <font color="#245bdb">popular</font>, <font color="#245bdb">favorite</font>, or <font color="#245bdb">choice</font> unless the data answers a question such as ‘<em>Which do you prefer / enjoy?</em>’ OR where it is clear that a choice has been made.</p>

<h2 data-number="1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="is-there-data-to-support-our-description"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Is there data to support our description?</h2>
<p>The data in this chart is from 9 different years, so the same question would need to be asked in each of these years. The first year is 1918 and the last year is 2011, which means this data covers a period of 93 years. Do you think the people who were asked this question in 1918 are the same people answering the question in 2011? I think you’ll agree this is highly unlikely. What about between 1971 and 1991? Again, we do not know. This tells us another important point: the data set for each year can tell us about general trends within the population of England and Wales, but it does not tell us about the movements of individual people. Therefore, we can’t draw conclusions like this:</p>
<p>However, <font color="#ff0000">over the next 40 years, more and more residents managed to buy their own place and moved out of rented accommodation.</font></p>
<p>This is going too far. We don’t know whether the people who said they owned their home in 1991 and moved out of rental accommodation - we do not have data for this. They could be people who have just moved to the area after selling a house somewhere else, they could have lived with their parents until they could afford to buy a house, someone may have given the house to them. The increased numbers of home owners may be due to housing becoming cheaper and easier to buy, government support, or many more homes being built in the area. We do not know, so we cannot make statements about this is our answer.</p>

<p>We need to present clear, logical evidence to support the points we make. The same idea applies in writing task 1. IF we make a statement such as ‘<em>more and more resident</em> <font color="#ff0000">moved out of rented accommodation</font>’, then we need to be sure we can supply evidence from the data we are given to support this. If there is no evidence in the data about <font color="#ff0000">people moving house</font>, then the statement is not relevant to the task.</p>

<h2 data-number="1.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="correlation-not-causation"><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Correlation not causation</h2>
<p>It is important to see the data set for each year in the graph as a separate set of people answering the survey question, and we shouldn’t try to connect the data in a cause and effect way. This is an important point in interpreting data, and a fact that is often repeated in academic writing that: <font color="#245bdb">correlation</font> (<em>two things matching or occurring at the same time</em>) should not be seen as <font color="#245bdb">causation</font> (<em>one thing being directly related to or caused by another</em>)</p>

<p>The increases in ice cream sales <font color="#245bdb">correspond</font> with increases in sun burn but this is <font color="#245bdb">correlation</font> not <font color="#245bdb">causation</font> - both just happen to occur in summer or hot weather.</p>

<p>Don’t try to find a connection between the data sets - we will not have enough information for this. We can talk about the data ‘<font color="#245bdb">corresponding</font>’, but we should not relate them directly or invent a story about what is happening.</p>

<h2 data-number="1.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="language-problems-in-this-task"><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> Language problems in this task</h2>
<p>This task presents some language challenges, especially as only 2 variables are mentioned (renting a home or living in a home you own). This means we need to try to avoid repeating the same words and phrases and we need to use different words to those in the question <strong>when possible</strong>. Remember, we do not need to vary this every time, sometimes a key word is unavoidable. We just need to reduce the number of times we repeat the same terms.</p>
<p>One way to do this is to vary the way we present the data. We can either write about the figures in the chart, or about the people behind the data. Look at the following examples, which all present the same fact:</p>
<ul>
<li><font color="#245bdb">The figure for rented</font> accommodation fell from just under 80% in 1918 to less than 70% in 1939.</li>
<li><font color="#245bdb">The percentage of people renting</font> accommodation fell from just under 80% in 1918 to less than 70% in 1939.</li>
<li><font color="#245bdb">Fewer people rented</font> accommodation in 1918 than in 1939 (just under 80% and 70% respectively)</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure to think about the people behind the statistic, and what the data presents.</p>

<h2 data-number="1.6" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="household-house-and-home"><span class="header-section-number">1.6</span> Household, House and home</h2>
<p>Although this question refers to ‘households’, this does not mean the people all lived in houses - they may have rented or owned a flat. A household refers to the group of people all living together within the same place - whether it is a house or flat. The word ‘home’ covers this nicely as a home refers to the place where we live, whether that is a tent, a boat, a flat, or a house.</p>
</section>
<section id="my-own-on-your-own-or-to-own" class="level2" data-number="1.7">
<h2 data-number="1.7" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="my-own-on-your-own-or-to-own"><span class="header-section-number">1.7</span> My own, on your own, or to own?</h2>
<p>The word ‘own’ often creates problems because of its different meanings and uses. For example, <font color="#245bdb">to own</font> is a verb meaning to have something that legally belongs to us; <font color="#245bdb">own</font> is also a pronoun, or can be used to mean ‘alone’</p>
<p>The verb ‘<font color="#245bdb">to own</font>’ is not used in the same way as the verb ‘to possess’, which has a much stronger meaning and is not appropriate in this context. Another important fact about the verb ‘to own’ is that it is a ‘stative’ verb, this mean it cannot be used in a continuous tense. So, we cannot say, ‘More people <font color="#ff0000">were owning</font> their home’. However, we can talk about ‘owning a home’ (the noun form of the verb), and we can also talk about ‘<font color="#245bdb">ownership</font>’ and ‘<font color="#245bdb">home ownership</font>’ (you will find this written as separate words, hyphenated, or as one word).</p>
<p>Look at the following sentences and decide whether the word ‘own’ is a verb, a pronoun, or means ‘alone’.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>That family is very rich, they live in a huge house and also <font color="#245bdb">own</font> 10 properties that they rent out. (verb)</li>
<li>I didn’t get my project finished because my family arrived and I couldn’t get any time <font color="#245bdb">on my own</font>. (alone)</li>
<li>I still live with my parents, I can’t wait to have <font color="#245bdb">my own</font> home. (pronoun)</li>
</ol>
<p>Consider also that, if we rent a property, someone owns it. The wording in the question and the chart is a little unhelpful here as it refers to ‘<font color="#245bdb">owned</font> accommodation’ and ‘<font color="#245bdb">rented</font> accommodation’. This works with ‘accommodation’ as the context is clear. But people are often tempted to write ‘<font color="#ff0000">living in an owned house / property</font>’, which does not work. We need to write ‘<font color="#245bdb">the percentage of people living in their own home</font>’ not ‘living in <del>an owned home</del>’</p>

<p>These words are useful umbrella terms to use as synonyms to avoid repetition.</p>
<p><font color="#245bdb">Sector</font> = and area of economic activity (similar to ‘field’ in the academic world). Examples of sector are: the banking sector; the tourism sector; the housing sector</p>
<p><font color="#245bdb">Market</font> = business or trade in a specific product (e.g.&nbsp;the rental market; the housing market)</p>

<li>Spend a few moments noticing the details in the bar chart. Pay attention to what is being measured as well as when, and how is it being measured.</li>
<li>Identify the key trends in the data and think about how to write about these in our overview. Remember - we should not mention just one trend.</li>
<li>Think about: what stayed the same, what changed, what comparisons can be made.</li>
<li>Group the information together so that we can write about it logically. Chronological order is the clearest and most logical. Remember to make comparisons where relevant.</li>
<li>Our paragraphs should cover one main idea (e.g.&nbsp;The data for renting) and this should be clear to the reader.</li>
<li>As we write, remember to vary our tenses and our sentences structures.</li>

<p>The chart shows the statistics of owning and renting accommodation of families in England and Wales from 1918 to 2011. Overall, people tend to lean more towards having their own properties as renting a house becomes less and less common.</p>
<p>In 1918, owned accommodations were less common, with just over 20% of people. This figure grew rapidly to 50% in 1971 and overtook the proportion of households in rented accommodations. The proportion of family living in their own home continued to rise to the peak of nearly 70% in 2011 before slightly dropping in 2011.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the figure for rented accommodations began the period with a dominant percentage, at nearly 4 times that of owned home in 1918. There was a mild fluctuation in the proportion in the figure of those renting home in 1918 and 1953. The period between 1953 and 2001 experienced a gradual drop in the figure, with just over 30% at the end of the period, before a small rising in 2011.</p>

<p>The chart illustrates the proportion of households in England and Wales that owned or rented accommodation between 1918 and 2011. Overall, the data shows a clear shift from renting to owning, with ownership becoming the dominant trend after the early 1970s.</p>
<p>In 1918, home ownership was relatively uncommon, accounting for just over 20% of households. This figure rose steadily throughout the period, reaching around 50% by 1971, at which point it overtook the share of rented homes. Ownership continued to increase, peaking at nearly 70% in 2001, before experiencing a slight decline in 2011.</p>
<p>By contrast, renting was the predominant form of housing in 1918, at almost four times the level of ownership. The percentage of renters fluctuated mildly between 1918 and 1953 but then fell consistently over the following decades, dropping to just over 30% by 2001. A small rebound occurred in 2011, although renting remained significantly less common than owning.</p>

<p>Suggested answers</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Change ‘which’ to ‘who’</li>
<li>This word should be singular: property</li>
<li>We generally don’t combine a related verb and noun (e.g.&nbsp;we do not say ‘they are planning a plan’) so we need to change either the verb or the noun: choosing this option / opting for this choice</li>
<li>We can either say ‘it decreased noticeably’ or ‘it decreased to 70%’, to say both, we need to add another verb (it decreased noticeably, failing to less than 70% …)</li>
<li>Change to: Home ownership / owning your own home</li>
<li>‘Possessing’ is not appropriate here. Change to ‘Owning’</li>
<li>‘Staying’ is temporary, this is about people ‘living’ in their own home.</li>

<ol type="1">
<li><p>The fact in this sentence contrasts to the previous one, so this needs to be indicated – (Hint: Start with ’However,…)</p></li>
<li><p>‘Before + ing’ is used to say what happened or what was done next and it is odd to use this with ‘remaining stable’ (i.e.&nbsp;nothing happened) ‘then remained’ would be better here.</p></li>
<li><p>How does this sentence connect with the previous one? (Hint: It is again introducing a contrasting idea, which needs to be indicated and it is also showing what happened from 1953, which also needs to be signalled). We have already used ‘However,….’ So show this contrast using ‘While….’ (Hint: To do that, you need to change the previous sentence and contrast this idea with remaining stable).</p></li>
<li><p>How do we use ‘as’? What is the function of ‘as’ here? (How does it connect the two ideas?) (Hint: Change this to ‘and’. What change could you make to ‘and reached’ to avoid repeating ‘and’ in the sentence?)</p></li>
<li><p>We use ‘the’ with the superlative when ranking several things but this is referring to the lowest point for renting, (Hint: use ‘its’)</p></li>
<li><p>This whole sentence is very long and this third point is different to the idea that started the sentence (People gradually became less interested in renting…) This means that again we need to show contrast, but it is also better to break this sentence into two. (Hint: Begin the new sentence with ‘It reached…’ and use ‘although’ to avoid repeating ‘however’ and ‘while’. )</p></li>

<p>Paragraph 2</p>

<li><p>This sentence should introduce the next topic. Is the main idea of this paragraph that ‘owning your home was less popular’? How can this be made clearer? Remember, you are helping the reader to follow your ideas.</p></li>
<li><p>Can you find a way to reduce the repetition of ‘owning’</p></li>
<li><p>We can sometimes use ‘however’ like this to add emphasis to the subject (This figure), but this seems odd here. Rewrite this to use ‘However’ correctly.</p></li>
<li><p>The word order makes this confusing reorder it so that it is clear exactly what happened in 1971 and add a new cohesive device to show when one figure ‘overtook’ the other.</p></li>

<ol type="1">
<li>and 2): Change to: ‘However, in 1939, it decreased noticeably, falling to less than 70%, then remained stable until 1953.’ (NB see next)</li>
</ol>
<p>3 To introduce a contrast and indicate the time element, we could start with: ‘However, from this point on/ onwards, …’ but we have already used ‘However,’ above, so, we need to change these sentences. For example:</p>
<p>‘’However, in 1939, it decreased noticeably, falling to less than 70%. While it remained relatively stable until 1953, from this point on, ….’’</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>‘As’ can be used to mean ‘at the same time / simultaneously’ (you can see this use in the overview) or to mean ‘because’. Neither meaning is appropriate here - we should not try to explain why something is happening in the data, so we need to change this to ‘and’. To avoid repeating ‘and’ we could change ‘and reached’ to ‘reaching’ :</li>
</ol>
<p>‘and the figure dropped steadily, reaching its lowest point of…’ (However, we will need to change this - see next sentence).</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li><p>change to ‘its lowest point’</p></li>
<li><p>The sentence needs to be broken up here and, again, we need to show contrast without repeating ‘However,’ or ‘While’. (see the final image below)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Paragraph 2</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>It is better to use ‘In contrast’ here. ‘On the other hand’ is used to give a balanced view or perspective and is not appropriate here. The main idea of the paragraph is that owned housing followed a different pattern. So we can say: ‘In contrast, owning a home followed the opposite trend.’ Or, we can just signal a change of subject: ’In terms of owning a home, in 1918…. / Turning to …,</li>
</ol>
<p>‘</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li><p>We can change ‘owning a home’ to ‘home ownership’ or change one of these to an active verb: ‘just over 20% of people owned ….’</p></li>
<li><p>However, …. (NB, to avoid repeating ‘However’ we could change this to: Nevertheless,)</p></li>
<li><p>To make the order of events clear, we need to put the date closest to the relevant verb: ‘However, in 1971, this figure rose rapidly to 50% and from 1981 overtook…’</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The bar chart provides statistic about families who lived in owned and rented accommodation in England and Wales from 1918 to 2011. Overall, renting a house became less and less common as people tended to lean more towards having their own property.</p>
<p>In 1918, rented accommodation was the dominant choice, with the majority of residents in England and in Wales choosing this option. The figure stood at nearly 80% of the total households in both countries. However, in 1939, it decreased noticeably, falling to less than 70%. While it remained relatively stable until 1953, from this point on, people gradually became less interested in renting accommodation and the figure dropped steadily. It reached its lowest point of around 30% in 2001, although it did rise slightly in 2011, the final year of the period.</p>
<p>In contrast, home ownership followed the opposite trend. In 1918, over 20% of families owned a property. Nevertheless, in 1971, this figure rose rapidly to 50% and from 1981 overtook the proportion of households in rented accommodation. By the end of the period, the percentage of households living in their own home had gone up to more than 60%.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Followed the chronological development and caught academic vocabulary (<em>waistcoat, breeches, silhouette</em>).</p></li>

<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Word Forms Practice</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Train with minimal pairs: <em>student / students</em>, <em>pocket / pockets</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>After each practice test, highlight every wrong answer by word form.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Dictation Training (2–3 min daily)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Listen to BBC podcasts / IELTS audios.</p></li>
<li><p>Write exactly what you hear (focus on <strong>articles, plurals, prepositions</strong>).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Distractor Training</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pause when you hear corrections (e.g., “It’s £30 – no sorry £13”) and train to always write the <strong>final version</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Theme Vocabulary</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Build word banks by IELTS themes (Fashion, Society, Education, Environment).</p></li>
<li><p>Review spelling and collocations weekly. # Recording 1</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>6. WIVENHOE (you wrote “WAVENHOE”)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>In the audio the recruiter <strong>spells it</strong>: “W-I-V-E-N-H-O-E”.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trap:</strong> unfamiliar UK place names + similar /w/ vs /v/ sounds.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fix:</strong> when a name is spelled, write letter-by-letter as you hear it. If you’re unsure of a consonant (v vs w), mark it and confirm when they repeat (“It’s quite central, just off Cork Street.”).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>8. £9.75 (you wrote £9.70)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Exact line: “<strong>to begin with, you’d be getting £9.75,</strong> but that goes up to £11.25 after three months.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trap:</strong> IELTS often says decimals as <strong>“nine seventy-five”</strong> (not “nine point seven five”). It’s easy to drop the “five”.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fix:</strong> train your ear for pay figures said as “seventy-five / twenty-five”. Also listen for <strong>contrast markers</strong> (“to begin with… but… goes up to…”) to lock in the <em>starting</em> rate vs the raise.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9. deliveries (you wrote “delivery”)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Exact cue: “making sure there’s enough stock each week — and <strong>sorting out all the deliveries</strong>.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trap:</strong> the table prompt “Maintaining stock and organising ______” doesn’t force plural, but the audio does (“<strong>all the</strong> deliveries”).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fix:</strong> Use <strong>grammar signals</strong> from the audio: <strong>“all the”</strong> → plural count noun → <strong>deliveries</strong>. (Also note the table heading: “Responsibilities include” → plural tasks.)</p></li>

<h2 data-number="5.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="q1114-short-corrections-why"><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> <strong>1) Q11–14 — short corrections + why</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Q11 &amp; Q12 — your answers: E, B — correct.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>E (convenient for workers)</em> — Mark says the site was chosen because there’s demand for housing for employees (commuting problem).</p></li>
<li><p><em>B (easy access to local facilities)</em> — he mentions the excellent hospital and a large secondary school nearby.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q13–14 — you answered:</strong> 13 <strong>B</strong> (correct), 14 <strong>E</strong> (incorrect).</p>
<p>This was a <strong>two-answer question (choose TWO letters B—E)</strong>; the correct pair is <strong>B and C</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>B (the impact on the environment)</em> — the public said the layout “blended in well with the natural features” and there was “provision made for protecting trees and wildlife.” That’s direct evidence for B.</p></li>
<li><p><em>C (encouragement of good relations between residents)</em> — Mark said the development “seem[s] a place where people of all ages can live together happily.” That indicates social harmony / good relations.</p></li>
<li><p><em>E (rural location)</em> is <strong>not</strong> a positive comment extracted in that passage (they did say “short drive to get out into the countryside” but that’s not framed as a positive feedback about the development itself the same way B and C are).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>i missed the word ‘short drive to get out’</p>
<p><strong>So:</strong> correct pair = <strong>B and C</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>21 — C</strong></p>
<p><em>It had a profound effect on society.</em></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Michelle: “what I found more significant was how it impacted directly and indirectly on political events, as well as having massive social and economic consequences.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>22 — A</strong></p>
<p><em>The number of places producing observations.</em></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Adam: “I was surprised there were so many weather stations established by that time — so… you can see how the weather changed, often by the hour.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>23 — B</strong></p>
<p><em>It was associated with health issues.</em></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Reports from the period blamed the haze for an increase in headaches, respiratory issues and asthma attacks.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>24 — B</strong></p>
<p><em>He was the first to identify the reason for the haze.</em> (what Michelle claimed and Adam corrects)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Michelle implied Franklin realised it first; Adam says “He’s often credited with that… but a French naturalist beat him to it.” So Adam corrects her claim that Franklin was first.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>25 &amp; 26 — A and B</strong> (choose TWO)</p>
<p><em>A. how widespread the effects were</em></p>
<p><em>B. how long-lasting the effects were</em></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>They note strange weather events reported <strong>two years after</strong> the eruption and <strong>as far away as North America and North Africa</strong>, showing both <em>widespread</em> and <em>long-lasting</em> effects.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Trap:</strong> D (speed of ash cloud) is mentioned (“the ash drifted so swiftly”) but the question asks for <strong>two</strong> issues that <em>surprised</em> them — the dialogue stresses <em>extent</em> and <em>duration</em> most clearly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I choose D, mistake, and trapped. They said 2 answer in 1 sentence and i missed ‘the far away ….’</p>
<p><strong>27 — D (Iceland)</strong></p>
<p><em>Animals suffered from sickness.</em></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“the effect on livestock was devastating… they were poisoned because they ate vegetation that had been contaminated with fluorine.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>28 — A (Egypt)</strong></p>
<p><em>This country suffered the most severe loss of life.</em></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“the famine there led to more people dying than any other country. It was worse than the plague.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>29 — C (UK)</strong></p>
<p><em>There was a significant increase in deaths of young people.</em></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“mortality rate… about double the usual number and included an unusually high percentage of people under the age of 25.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>30 — F (USA)</strong></p>
<p><em>It caused a particularly harsh winter.</em></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>George Washington: “they were snowbound until March in Virginia” and reports of “ice floating down the Mississippi.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 data-number="6.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="quick-exam-tips-from-this-section"><span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> <strong>Quick exam tips from this section</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p>For “what surprised them” style questions, listen for <em>explicit</em> surprise phrases (“I found all that hard to believe,” “It must have been terrible”) tied to concrete facts (distance, duration).</p></li>
<li><p>When two answers are required, don’t pick a detail mentioned in passing (D/speed) unless the speakers emphasise it as surprising.</p></li>
<li><p>Note attributions: words like <em>“credited with”</em> vs <em>“actually first”</em> indicate subtle corrections (see Q24).</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="q24-franklin-and-the-haze" class="level3" data-number="6.2.1">
<h3 data-number="6.2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="q24-franklin-and-the-haze"><span class="header-section-number">6.2.1</span> <strong>❌ Q24 (Franklin and the haze)</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Your answer:</strong> not correct.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Correct answer: B — He was the first to identify the reason for the haze.</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p>Michelle says Franklin realised the haze was caused by a volcano. Adam then <em>corrects her</em>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“He’s often credited with that… but in fact a French naturalist got there first.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the <em>claim about Franklin</em> = <strong>He was the first</strong>. That’s exactly what option B says. The answer is <strong>B</strong> (even though it was wrong historically, the question is about the claim).</p>
<p><strong>Trap:</strong> Many test-takers confuse what Franklin <em>actually did</em> with what he was <em>credited for</em>.</p>
</section>
<section id="q25-two-things-that-surprised-them" class="level3" data-number="6.2.2">
<h3 data-number="6.2.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="q25-two-things-that-surprised-them"><span class="header-section-number">6.2.2</span> <strong>❌ Q25 (two things that surprised them)</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Your answer:</strong> one wrong.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Correct answers:</strong> <strong>A — how widespread the effects were</strong> &amp; <strong>B — how long-lasting the effects were.</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p>Adam says:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Reports came in not just from Europe but from North America and North Africa too.” → <strong>Widespread</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“And even two years later there were still odd weather events linked to it.” → <strong>Long-lasting</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Option D (<em>how quickly the ash cloud spread</em>) is <strong>mentioned</strong>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The ash drifted so swiftly…”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But notice — they don’t say they were <strong>surprised</strong> by that. The question is “What surprised them?” So only A &amp; B fit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Trap:</strong> IELTS loves to mention three things, but only two are correct. Many candidates pick the wrong extra detail (here: speed).</p>
<p>✅ Key learning for you:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Q24:</strong> Focus on <em>the claim</em> (not the correction).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Q25:</strong> Only tick things explicitly linked to “surprised / amazed / hard to believe.” # Recording 4</p></li>

<p>The diagram shows the process of recycled paper production. Overall, the linear process comprises four main stages, beginning with making pulp from used paper and ending with producing recycled paper.</p>
<p>Firstly, used paper is transported by a conveyor belt. After that, chemicals and water are used to break down paper into pulp. After this stage, it will be passed through a filter to remove contaminants.</p>
<p>Next, the filtered pulp is cleaned by air, water, and soap before passing through water and chemicals. Clean pulp is moved by conveyor belt to paper-making machine. Finally, it will be passed through heated rollers to remove paper before being rolled and ready to use.</p>

<p>The diagram illustrates the process involved in the production of recycled paper. Overall, the procedure is linear and consists of four distinct stages, starting with the conversion of waste paper into pulp and ending with the manufacture of new rolls of paper.</p>
<p>In the initial stage, discarded paper is placed on a conveyor belt and combined with water and chemicals, which break it down into pulp. This pulp mixture is subsequently passed through a filter in order to remove contaminants such as plastic or staples.</p>
<p>At the next stage, the filtered pulp undergoes a cleaning process. It is treated with are, water, and soap, before additional chemicals are applied to ensure that any remaining impurities are eliminated. Once this cleaning is complete, the pulp is transferred by conveyor belt to a paper-making machine. Here, it is pressed between heated rollers to remove excess moisture. Finally, the recycled paper is rolled into large sheets, ready to be distributed for reuse.</p>

<p>The diagrams show different stages in the manufacturing process of sugar from sugar cane. Overall, the linear process takes at least 12 months and comprises three main stages, each of which takes place in a different production area.</p>
<p>In the first stage, sugar cane is grown and nurtured for 12 to 18 months. After growing, sugar cane will be harvested by machine or by hand. It is crushed by a machine to remove sugarcane residue and produce juice. The juice then passed through a limestone filter, which removes any contaminants.</p>
<p>At the end of this stage, the pure juice is boiled over fire to remove excess water, after which the juice is evaporated and becomes syrup. It will undergo a centrifuge process, separating sugar crystals from the syrup. Finally, the sugar is drying and cooling to remove excess moisture.</p>

<p>The diagrams illustrate the various stages involved in producing sugar from sugar cane. Overall, the linear process takes between 12 and 18 months and comprises three main stages: growing, processing, and refining.</p>
<p>In the first stage, sugar cane is cultivated and nurtured in the field for 12 to 18 months. Once mature, it is harvested either manually, using a knife, or mechanically, with the help of a harvester. The harvested cane is then crushed by a machine to extract juice, while the remaining residue is discarded. This juice is subsequently passed through a limestone filter to eliminate impurities.</p>
<p>Next, the purified juice is boiled in an evaporator to remove excess water. As a result, a concentrated syrup is produced. This syrup is transferred into a centrifuge, which spins at high speed to separate sugar crystals from the remaining liquid.</p>
<p>Finally, in the refining stage, the sugar crystals are dried and cooled to remove any residual moisture. At this point, the refined sugar is ready for packaging and consumption.</p>

<li>The length of time - this is only given in step 1, so we don’t know how long the other steps take.</li>
<li>The names we are given: e.g.&nbsp;<em>sugar cane, juice; limestone filter, syrup, heat, sugar crystals, sugar</em>.</li>
<li>Notice that with sugar cane, we can use the plural to write about the individual canes (as in the diagram) or the singular to write about the crop (as in the question).</li>
<li>Notice the different arrows - In particular, those showing that there are two ways of harvesting the crop.</li>
<li>In step 5 and 6 we are given extra information about what is happening.</li>
<li>Notice that ‘centrifuge’ is a noun not a verb (there is no ‘ing’ at the end)</li>

<h2 data-number="1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="stages-and-trends"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Stages and trends</h2>
<p>As we saw in lesson 9, process tasks have stages rather than trends, and it is these stages that we must highlight in our body paragraphs and summarise in our overview. We identity a trend by looking at the beginning point in the data. A common problem in process tasks is that, in their overview, candidates often mention only the first and the last stage in the process, thus confusing a stage with a trend. Look at the following example:</p>
<p><font color="#ff0000">The process consists of seven steps of various time length, starting by farming sugar canes and ending by dry sugar ready to use.</font></p>
<p>It not very helpful here.</p>
<p><em>There is an overview presented in the first paragraph which summaries the process into the farming stages and the drying stages. This summary could be more detailed, e.g.&nbsp;farming, crushing, separating and drying stages.</em></p>
<p>It is true that this is not a complete or clear overview because we do not get a clear picture of what happens between the farming of the sugar canes and the dry sugar at the end. However, the use of the word ‘detailed’ is unfortunate here. It would have been better to say that the overview needs to include more information in order to be a clear or complete overview.</p>
<p>Listing four of the steps in the diagram as example (e.g.&nbsp;farming, crushing, separating, and drying stages) also suggests you should include these words in our overview, which is not a good idea as they are given in the question. Later in this lesson we will look at how to avoid using words from the question paper, which is very important. In PC view, this advice is better expressed as follows: <font color="#245bdb">There is an overview presented in the first paragraph which mentions two stage: farming and drying. A clearer summary would give an overview of the main stages rather than just the first and the last steps in the process.</font></p>

<p>To identify the main stages in a process, we need to do more than just look at the beginning and end. Instead, we need to look at the different steps in the process and see if we can group them together in some way. This will help to categories them. With our current task, PC identified two main stages, each of which involves more than one step. Can you identify the two categories from the following list? NB The words you choose should umbrella terms rather than one specific step</p>

<h2 data-number="1.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="steps-and-stages"><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Steps and stages</h2>
<p>In lesson 4.2, PC recommended asking ourselves questions about a diagram, like this:</p>
<p><font color="#245bdb">Q: What are being shown here? A: This diagram is showing the steps involved in …</font></p>
<p>A step is one part of a process. Here are some useful phrases with the word ‘step’:</p>
<ul>
<li>When learning a new skill, it is best to do it <font color="#245bdb">one step at a time</font>. = (slowly and deliberately)</li>
<li>I will explain what you need to do <font color="#245bdb">step by step</font>. (=giving instruction in a logical order)</li>
<li>Changing the resources you need to use to practice is <font color="#245bdb">a step in the right decision</font>. (= a good starting point)</li>
</ul>
<p>The word ‘stage’ has a broader meaning:</p>
<p>We’re renovating the house <font color="#245bdb">in stages</font>, we’ll start with the downstairs areas, then do the upstairs rooms, and finally the area outside the house.</p>
<p>This mean than we can say that the diagram shows seven steps in a process, but we can also group these steps into key stages. This is very helpful in producing a clear overview, but we need ask a second question:</p>
<p><em>Q 1: What are we being shown here? Ans: The diagram shows the steps involved in a process.</em></p>
<p><font color="#245bdb">Q 2: What are main stages in this process?</font></p>
<p>Looking carefully at the diagram will help. One easy way to decide a ‘main stage’ is to look at the product or material being processed and noticing when it changes in form (e.g.&nbsp;from a plant to a juice). This means that, we need to notice:</p>
<ul>
<li><font color="#245bdb">What type of process it is (e.g.&nbsp;mechanical, manual)</font></li>
<li><font color="#245bdb">How many steps there are</font></li>
<li><font color="#245bdb">Where the process takes place</font></li>
<li><font color="#245bdb">the product and how it changes</font></li>
<li><font color="#245bdb">whether any of the steps can be grouped together into key stages</font></li>
</ul>
<p>In our current diagram there are seven steps numbered 1-7, but they are not all equal. Some are important separate stages (growing, harvesting) while others are smaller steps in a part of the process (purifying, evaporating, separating). Looking at how the product changes (from sugar canes, to juice, to syrup, then sugar) helps to group these together so that we can summarize them in a clear overview.</p>

Tip
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>We can identify the main stages by grouping steps together. Remember, we are always looking for the main changes, so looking at when the product changes form can also help.</p>
<p>For example: the plant -&gt; juice -&gt; syrup -&gt; sugar</p>

<p>PC’s note for this step</p>
<p><img src="https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/how-to-write-ielts-writing-task1-10/Pasted image 20250826151628.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>For her overview, she identified two main stages 1) the growing and harvesting the crop and 2) the processing of the juice from canes to produce sugar. To make sure our overview is ‘complete’ and ‘clear’, we can include the following</p>
<ul>
<li>the type of process</li>
<li>how many stages there are and what these are (using umbrella terms)</li>
<li>what happens during the process (without giving too much detail) i.e.&nbsp;the main changes</li>
</ul>
<p>Although we can’t avoid giving some details here (e.g.&nbsp;sugar cane and sugar) try to avoid giving too many other details in this overview. Write our version below then compare it to her later when we look at her model.</p>
<section id="overview-practice" class="level3" data-number="1.4.1">
<h3 data-number="1.4.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview-practice"><span class="header-section-number">1.4.1</span> Overview Practice</h3>
<p>Try to predict what PC overview will look like by writing an overview statement that includes the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>the type of process</li>
<li>the number of stages and what they are (use umbrella terms)</li>
<li>what happens during the process (avoid giving too much detail here)</li>
</ul>
<p>linear process 2 stages farming, and processing</p>
<p>Overall, the linear process consists of two main stages, including sugar cane farming and processing of juice to produce sugar. # Changing the language in the question</p>
<p>Process tasks generally have more language on the question paper than other tasks. This helps us to understand what is happening but it also means we need to be careful: in order to show our language skills, we need to avoid just copying the language on the diagram.</p>
<p>The different steps in the process are labelled, usually with the noun form of a verbs (the ing form). For example, <strong>growing, harvesting, crushing, purifying, evaporating, drying and cooling</strong>. Steps 5 and 6 in our current diagram are unusual. Rather than adding more detail to the diagram (e.g.&nbsp;showing and labelling the syrup and the centrifuge), the question is tell us that, in step 5 ‘juice becomes syrup’ and in step 6 the centrifuge ‘separates sugar crystals from syrup’. So we have even more language to avoid copying here.</p>
<p>Repetition is another common problem in process tasks, as it is easy to use the same grammatical structures repeatedly. To solve these problems, use the language points below to build our vocabulary and our grammatical range and accuracy.</p>

<h2 data-number="1.6" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="changing-from-ing-to-passive"><span class="header-section-number">1.6</span> Changing from ing to passive</h2>
<p>In our body paragraphs, we will need to change the ‘ing’ forms in the diagram and use the verbs actively or, more often, passively. For example:</p>
<p><font color="#245bdb">Step 1) growing -&gt; the sugar can is grown.</font></p>
<p>Be careful with verbs that cannot be used in the passive. Verbs like this cannot have an object. For example, the verb ‘fall’ cannot be used with an object (something can fall but we cannot fall something). So we can say:</p>
<p><font color="#245bdb">The apples fall into a bucket.</font></p>
<p>But we cannot say:</p>
<p>A worker <del>falls the apples</del> into a bucket.</p>
<p>Which is why we also cannot use it in the passive</p>
<p>The apples <del>are fallen</del> into a bucket.</p>
<p>Instead, we would need to use the verb ‘drop’ here.</p>
<ul>
<li><font color="#245bdb">A worker drops the apple into a bucket.</font></li>
<li><font color="#245bdb">The apples are dropped into a bucket.</font></li>
</ul>
<p>Problem verbs like these are called ‘intransitive verbs’ and we will see the letter [i] in brackets next to them in a dictionary. The verbs that can have an object are called transitive and have a [T] next to them. Some verbs can be both, depending on their meaning. Other intransitive verbs to be careful of (and which cannot be used in the passive) are:</p>
<p><font color="#245bdb">appear, arrive, become, come, disappear, go, jump</font></p>

<p>In a process task, we often need to say <font color="#245bdb">why</font> something is done. <font color="#245bdb">To + infinitive</font> can be helpful here. For example, this sentence, ‘Seeds are planted to produce the crop’, tells us why the seeds are planted.</p>

<h2 data-number="1.8" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="avoid-repetition"><span class="header-section-number">1.8</span> Avoid repetition</h2>
<p>To avoid repeating the same structures, we can also use a relative clause or reduced relative clause to explain the result of a step. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The plants are crushed <font color="#245bdb">to extract</font> the juice.</li>
<li>The plants are crushed<font color="#245bdb">,</font> <font color="#245bdb">which extracts</font> the juice.</li>
<li>The plants are crushed<font color="#245bdb">, extracting the</font> juice.</li>
</ul>
<p>As we saw in the vocabulary note, sometimes, we can add the verb ‘allow’:</p>
<ul>
<li>The plants are crushed <font color="#245bdb">to extract</font> the juice.</li>
<li>The plants are crushed, <font color="#245bdb">which allows the juice to be extracted</font>.</li>
<li>The plants are crushed, <font color="#245bdb">allowing the juice to be extracted</font>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 data-number="1.9" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="after-once-and-when"><span class="header-section-number">1.9</span> After, Once and When</h2>
<p>Another way to avoid repeating the same structures is to use <em>after, once</em> or <em>when</em>. This allows us to use a present perfect or present perfect passive and show a range of grammatical structures.</p>
<p>Look at the following examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><font color="#245bdb">First the crop is grown and then it is harvested.</font></li>
<li><font color="#245bdb">After the crop has grown, it is harvested.</font></li>
<li><font color="#245bdb">Once the crop has grown, it is harvested.</font></li>
<li><font color="#245bdb">When the crop has grown, it is harvested.</font></li>
</ul>
<p>We can vary the tense of the second clause by saying it: it <font color="#245bdb">can be</font> harvested, or it <font color="#245bdb">will be</font> harvested. However, we cannot use ‘will’ immediately following after, once, or when</p>
<p>After / Once / When the crop <font color="#245bdb">will be grown</font></p>

<p>The diagrams show the process used to make sugar. Overall, this is a largely mechanical process comprising two main stages: the farming of sugar cane and the processing of the crop, which turns it into a liquid and eventually into sugar.</p>
<p>The first stage of the process is the longest as the sugar cane takes between 12 to 18 months to grow tall enough for harvesting. Once it is fully grown, the crop can be harvested in two ways, either mechanically using specialist machinery or by hand, a much more labour-intensive method.</p>
<p>The second stage is wholly mechanical and involves five steps. First, the plants are crushed to form a juice, which is then extracted. The juice is purified by passing it through a limestone filter before being heated. During this step, the liquid content of the juice evaporates leaving behind a syrup. The syrup is then put in a centrifuge and spun at a high enough speed to separate out the sugar crystals, which are subsequently dried and cooled to produce the final product.</p>

<ul>
<li>PC overview mentions the two main stages and the main changes, and these are reflected in her two body paragraphs.</li>
<li>She was able to make two comparisons: 1) the longest stage in the process and 2) comparising the different methods used for harvesting</li>
<li>In her editing, she read her answer aloud to see if there was repetition - this lead her to change to sentences to fix the following problems: 1) a repetition of ‘then’ (<em>Is then extracted … is then heated</em>) and 2) in the last sentence, she had written ‘which are <u>finally</u> dried and cooled to produce the <u>final</u> product.’. Notice the changes she made to avoid this. Be sure to read through our own answer in our head if we have time at the end.</li>
<li>Notice the clear coherence and cohesion in her answer. She signaled the main topic of each paragraph very clearly (The first stage … The second stage) and the information is logically organized, step by step. Try to notice the referencing and how we can easily trace the ideas (the zig-zag pattern we saw in lesson 9) ## Writing clearly</li>
</ul>
<p>Look back at the overview sentence we wrote earlier and compare it to her. How clear is our writing?</p>
<p>A problem can occur in our overview if we identify the main stages but then do note make these clear in our overview. Look at the following example:</p>
<p><em>Overall, the process compromises two main stages,</em> <font color="#c00000">where sugar canes and their juice are processed, and there are several different tools involved.</font></p>
<p>This overview begins well, stating that there are two main stages, but then presents the information as though this is one stage: <font color="#ff0000">where sugar canes and their juice are processed</font>. We need to show these are two separate stages:</p>
<p><font color="#245bdb">Overall, the process comprises two main stages, during which sugar canes are grown in the field, and then processed in the factory, when their juice is extracted and turned into sugar.</font></p>
<p>It is important to note that there are many ways to give our overview. For example, in the new version above she mentioned the two locations (the field and the factory). The following is another example of a clear overview.</p>
<p>The entire process includes a total of 7 stages with the plant undergoing various changes in form from solid to liquid then to syrup. Although the process is partly manutal, most of the stages involves heavy machinery.</p>

<p>The diagrams show different stages in the manufacturing process of sugar from sugar cane. Overall, the linear process takes at least 12 months and comprises three main stages, each of which takes place in a different production area.</p>
<p>In the first stage, sugar cane is grown and nurtured for 12 to 18 months. After growing, sugar cane will be harvested by machine or by hand. It is crushed by a machine to remove sugarcane residue and produce juice. The juice then passed through a limestone filter, which removes any contaminants.</p>
<p>At the end of this stage, the pure juice is boiled over fire to remove excess water, after which the juice is evaporated and becomes syrup. It will undergo a centrifuge process, separating sugar crystals from the syrup. Finally, the sugar is drying and cooling to remove excess moisture.</p>

<p>The diagrams illustrate the process by which sugar is produced from sugar cane. Overall, this is a <strong>linear and partly mechanical process</strong> that requires at least twelve months and can be divided into three main stages: cultivation, extraction and purification, and crystallisation with drying.</p>
<p>In the first stage, sugar cane plants are cultivated for a period of 12 to 18 months until they reach maturity. Once this has occurred, they are harvested either manually or using mechanical equipment. The stalks are then crushed to extract juice, which is subsequently purified through a limestone filter to remove any unwanted residue.</p>
<p>Following this, the filtered juice is boiled in order to evaporate excess water and is converted into syrup. This syrup undergoes centrifugation, during which sugar crystals are separated from the remaining liquid. In the final stage, the crystals are dried and cooled, producing refined sugar ready for distribution.</p>

<p>Firstly, in the factory, limestone, clay are crushed to have raw powder. To create a thinner texture, it will be mixed by the mixer before being heated and rotated simultaneously by the rotating heater. The powder then moves to the grinder and becomes cement. After that, cement will be stored in bags and will be ready to use.</p>
<p>At the construction site, with a relatively small percentage of cement (15%), sand and gravel are added by a large percentage, by 25% and 50% respectively, and a little water (10%). The mixture is added to a concrete mixer to produce concrete.</p>

<p><strong>Question (summary):</strong></p>
<p>The diagrams show how cement is made and how concrete is produced.</p>
<p><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Paraphrase: The diagrams illustrate the process of cement production, and how this material is used to produce concrete.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Overview</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cement production: takes place in a factory, involves several stages.</p></li>
<li><p>Concrete: made by mixing different materials at a building site.</p></li>
<li><p>Key contrast: one is multi-step manufacturing, the other is simple mixing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Body Paragraph 1 – Cement production</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Raw materials: limestone &amp; clay.</p></li>
<li><p>Crusher → powder.</p></li>
<li><p>Mixer → rotating heater → grinding → cement.</p></li>
<li><p>Cement packaged in bags.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Body Paragraph 2 – Concrete production</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Four ingredients: cement (15%), water (10%), sand (25%), gravel (50%).</p></li>
<li><p>Combine in a concrete mixer → final product = concrete</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The diagrams show the process of producing cement and how this is then used in the production of concrete for construction. Overall, cement production involves several stages that take place in a factory, while concrete is made by combining different materials in a mixer at the building site.</p>
<p>In the first stage of cement manufacture, limestone and clay are crushed together to form a powder. This mixture then passes through a mixer before entering a rotating heater, where it is simultaneously heated and mixed. The resulting substance is ground in a grinder to produce cement. The finished product is then packaged in bags for use.</p>
<p>Concrete production, on the other hand, is a much simpler process. Four ingredients are combined in a concrete mixer: 15% cement, 10% water, 25% sand, and 50% gravel. These are throughly mixed together to form concrete, which can then be used in construction.</p>

<p>The diagram illustrates the process by which wool is obtained from sheep and transformed into various products. Overall, this is a largely mechanical process comprising two main stages: preparing the raw wool and converting it into yarn and finished goods.</p>
<p>The first stage of the process is shearing and can be done by hand. a vital step to obtain raw materials. This is followed by cleaning to eliminate impurities and drying to remove redundant water. While quality wool will be separated to be processed in the next step, messy wool will be strung and used for recycling. The wool is compacted into tufts and arranged and stored for the next stage.</p>
<p>The second stage is almost mechanical and involves four steps. First, the storage wool is dyed for the demanded colors. The colored wool is then put in a spinning machine and spun at a speed to create balls of yarn. The yarn will be either knitted into textiles or further crafted into jackets and carpets.</p>

<p>Fix grammar:</p>
<p>The diagram illustrates the process by which wool is obtained from sheep and transformed into various products. Overall, this is a largely mechanical process comprising two main stages: preparing the raw wool and converting it into yarn and finished goods.</p>
<p>The first stage of the process is shearing, which can be done by hand and is a vital step in obtaining the raw material. This is followed by cleaning to eliminate impurities and drying to remove excess moisture. While high-quality wool is separated for further processing, lower-quality wool is set aside for recycling. The wool is then compacted into tufts, which are arranged and stored for the next stage.</p>
<p>The second stage is mainly mechanical and involves four steps. First, the stored wool is dyed in desired colors. The dyed wool is then placed in a spinning machine and spun into balls of yarn. Finally, the yarn is either knitted into textiles or manufactured into products such as jackets and carpets.</p>
<hr>
<p>The diagram illustrates how wool is obtained from sheep and processed into a variety of products. Overall, the procedure consists of two main stages: preparing the raw wool and converting it into yarn for the production of textiles and garments.</p>
<p>In the first stage, sheep are shorn to obtain the fleece, a process which can be carried out manually. The raw wool is then thoroughly cleaned to remove dirt and other impurities before being dried to eliminate excess moisture. At this point, the fleece is graded: the finer wool is selected for further processing, while the lower-quality material is recycled. The usable wool is then compacted into tuffs and shored for later use.</p>
<p>The second stage is largely mechanical. The tufts are first dyed in a range of colors and subsequently spun in machines to produce balls of yarn. This yarn is either knitted into fabric or manufactured into finished goods such as jackets and carpets.</p>
<hr>
<p>Longer:</p>
<p>The diagram illustrates the process through which wool is obtained from sheep and converted into a range of products. Overall, it is a linear and partly mechanical procedure that can be divided into two broad stages: the preparation of raw fleece and the transformation of this material into yarn and finished items.</p>
<p>The process begins with the shearing of sheep, during which the fleece is removed by hand. This raw material then undergoes a series of treatments: it is carefully washed to eliminate dirt and grease, and subsequently dried to remove excess moisture. At this point, the wool is graded. While fine-quality fibres are selected for production, lower-quality portions are recycled rather than discarded. The usable wool is then compacted into tufts, which are systematically arranged and kept in storage until further processing.</p>
<p>In the second stage, the tufts are first dyed in a variety of colours. They are then fed into a spinning machine, where they are twisted at high speed into balls of yarn. This yarn can be knitted into fabric for textiles, or alternatively manufactured into a range of end products, including jackets for clothing and carpets for domestic use.</p>
<p>other essay:</p>
<p>The diagram outlines the intricate process of converting raw wool from sheep into various finished products such as jackets, carpets, and knitted items for personal or industrial use. Overall, the procedure involves a series of well-defined stages, from shearing and cleaning to dyeing and final crafting, with notable emphasis on recycling excess materials.</p>
<p>In terms of the initial stages, the process begins with shearing wool from the sheep, a vital step to obtain raw material. This is followed by cleaning to eliminate impurities and drying to ready it for subsequent stages. The processed wool is then compacted into tufts and stored to maintain a consistent resource flow.</p>
<p>Turning to the remaining phases, the stored tufts are dyed to introduce vibrant colors, enhancing their visual appeal. Next, the wool is separated into finer threads and spun into yarn using spinning balls. The yarn is subsequently either knitted into textiles or further crafted into jackets and carpets. Interestingly, surplus material from the separation stage is recycled, reflecting an eco-friendly approach in the process.</p>

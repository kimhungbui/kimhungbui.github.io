<section id="expressing-opinions-impersonally" class="level1 page-columns page-full" data-number="1">
<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Expressing opinions impersonally</h1>
<p>In academic communication, we tend to be impersonal, focusing more on actions, we effects of actions, and the things affected by actions rather than the people performing the actions. We often use <em>it-</em> clauses to express opinions impersonally in academic writing and speaking. Common patterns here:</p>
<p><strong><em>it</em> + be (adverb) + adjective + <em>to-</em> infinitive</strong></p>
<p>e.g.&nbsp;<strong>It is extremely difficult to evaluate</strong> the role of tourism in urban renewal.</p>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div class="">
<p><em>Other adjectives</em> commonly used in this pattern: <strong>(in)convenient, easy, hard, important, (im)possible, interesting, (un)necessary, (un)reasonable, (in)sufficient, useful</strong></p>
</div></div><p><strong><em>it</em> + be + (adverb) + adjective + <em>that</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>It is quite possible that</strong> a larger sample size would have shown different results.</p>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div class="">
<p><em>Other adjectives</em> commonly used in this pattern: <strong>apparent, (un)clear, (in)conveivable, doubtful, essential, evident, important, (un)likely, obvious, probable, true</strong></p>
</div></div><p>Note that not all adverbs and adjectives in these patterns can combine. For example, we commonly use <strong>quite + possible/ clear</strong>, nut rarely <strong>quite + doubtful/ essential</strong></p>
<p>We often use a passive verb form in an <strong>it- clause</strong> with <strong>that</strong> when we report another person‚Äôs opinion. Notice that we usually include a reference to the other person‚Äôs work, often immediately after the reporting verb or at the end of the sentences:</p>
<p><strong>It has been reported</strong> (Crane, 2015) <strong>that</strong> prolonged periods sitting in front of a computer may have significant health risks.</p>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div class="">
<p>Verbs commonly used in this pattern:<br>
<strong>argue*</strong>, <strong>claim*</strong>, <strong>contend*</strong>, <strong>demonstrate</strong>, <strong>estimate</strong>, <strong>maintain*</strong>, <strong>note</strong>, <strong>propose*</strong>, <strong>report*</strong>, <strong>show</strong>, <strong>suggest*</strong></p>
</div></div></section>
<section id="distancing-yourself-from-a-point-of-view" class="level1" data-number="2">
<h1 data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Distancing yourself from a point of view</h1>
<p>We often use an <strong>it-clause</strong> when we want to distance ourselves from an earlier point of view, perhaps because it is now disputed, or because we feel there was some limitation or problem with the earlier work:</p>
<p><strong>It has been claimed that</strong> cheese intake is associated with high cholesterol levels (Zemel, 2001), but more recent studies have found that cheese may even have a cholesterol lowering effect (Hamedi, 2018; Allen, 2019)</p>
<p><strong>It is often suggested that</strong> air pollutants from traffic, such as nitrogen oxide (NO2) and suspended particulate matter have a negative impact on child health (e.g.&nbsp;Janssen, 2004, Knape 2012). However, relatively few studies so far have looked at the health of children living near busy roads.</p>
<p>The reporting verbs mark * in Above margin note are often used in this way.</p>
</section>
<section id="disagreeing" class="level1" data-number="3">
<h1 data-number="3"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Disagreeing</h1>
<p>In academic contexts we often begin a disagreement by acknowledging that some part of the opposing position is true. <em>Its-clauses</em> are often used for this in academic writing and also in spoken academic contexts (presentation, seminars, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>It is sometimes argued that</strong> it is important for students to outline their essays before beginning writing (e.g.&nbsp;Cotton, 2004). While <strong>it is quite correct that</strong> much of an essay can be planned in advanced, <strong>it must also be noted that</strong> the act of writing itself facilities thought and shapes ideas.</p>
<p><strong>It‚Äôs often assumed that</strong> environmental sustainability and poverty reduction can go hand-in-hand. Although <strong>it‚Äôs certainly possible to find</strong> a small number of examples where this happens, in most cases in the literature <strong>it is reported that</strong> the costs of environmental improvement fall on the poor rather than the wealthy.</p>
<p>However, in less formal spoken contexts we sometimes prefer more personal forms. For example: <strong>We often assume that ‚Ä¶, ‚Ä¶ you can certainly find ‚Ä¶</strong>.</p>

  <title>Complex noun phrases and complex prepositions</title>
  <dc:creator>Hung </dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<section id="complex-noun-phrases" class="level1 page-columns page-full" data-number="1">
<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Complex noun phrases</h1>
<p>Long, complex noun phrases are typical of academic writing, allowing a lot of information to be included within one sentence element. They can make up <sup>1</sup> substantial parts of academic texts as subjects, objects, and complements. The complex noun phrases in this extract are in italics with the main noun in each phrase in bold.</p>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div class="">
<p><strong>üîç ‚Äúmake up‚Äù (phrasal verb)</strong><br>
Means:<br>
- <strong>form</strong><br>
- <strong>constitute</strong><br>
- <strong>compose</strong></p>
<p>üìò Example meaning:<br>
&gt; Complex noun phrases <strong>make up</strong> (= form) large parts of academic writing.</p>
</div></div><p>The <strong>changes</strong> in map data collection and representation that have arisen with the introduction of computers and digital techniques are remarkable. <strong>Information</strong> that used to be collected manually from surveys and ground observations can now be collected almost instantaneously by orbiting <strong>satellites</strong> that send data to Earth at the speed of light. <strong>Maps</strong> that were once hand-drawn can now be produced on a computer and printed out in a relatively short <strong>amount</strong> of time.</p>
<p>Note the word order in complex noun phrases -</p>
<ul>
<li>The most common elements <em>before</em> the main noun in a complex noun phrase are: determiners (e.g.&nbsp;<em>a, the</em>), and adjectives (<em>e.g.&nbsp;orbiting</em>)</li>
<li>The most common elements <em>after</em> the main noun are: relative clauses (<em>e.g.: that were once hand-drawn</em>), and adjectives (<em>e.g.&nbsp;orbiting</em>)</li>
<li>After the main noun in particular, elements are often embedded within others. For example, the relative clause <em>that have arisen with the introduction of computers</em> includes the prepositional phrase <em>with the introduction of computers</em> which in turn includes the prepositional phrase of <em>computers</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In academic writing we tend to use nouns to talk about <em>actions</em> and <em>processes</em> (more typically associated with verbs), and <em>qualities</em> (more typically associated with adjectives). This use of a noun to convey a meaning usually expressed with a word from another class is referred to as <em>nominalization</em>, and this process often results in a complex noun phrase. Compare the noun phrases in these two texts:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>Organizations have reported that <strong>the number of people volunteering has decreased rapidly</strong> in recent years. At the same time, <strong>more opportunities to volunteer have become available</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>An extremely rapid decrease in volunteering</strong> has been reported in recent years. At the same time, <strong>the availability of opportunities to volunteer has increased</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Where (i) uses a verb (<em>has decreased</em>) and adjective (<em>available</em>), (ii), more typical of academic writing, uses nouns (<em>decrease, availability</em>).</p>
</section>
<section id="complex-prepositions" class="level1" data-number="2">
<h1 data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Complex prepositions</h1>
<p>Complex prepositions comprise two, three or four words. Some of these occur more frequently in academic writing than in general use. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>As for</strong> the future, demand for electricity is expected to grow at a rate of 5% per annum. (= regarding)</li>
<li>The final chapter considers inequalities in health <strong>with reference to</strong> race and gender. (= what it is about)</li>
<li>Monthly average temperatures were higher than average <strong>with the exception of</strong> June. (= not including)</li>
</ul>
<div class="collum-margin">
<p>Also: <strong>as a result of, as distinct from, as opposed to, depending on, in comparison with, in line with, in the case of, irrespective of, on the part of, prior to, regardless of</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Note that four-word prepositions usually end in <em>of</em> and include an article.</p>
<p>Complex prepositions often occur as part of complex noun phrases:</p>
<ul>
<li>This essay has discussed <em>class identity</em> <strong>with reference to</strong> <em>gender differences</em>.</li>
<li>The study found a <em>less positive attitude</em> <strong>in the case of</strong> <em>customers exposed</em> to <em>advertising and marketing communications</em>.</li>

<p>The two maps show road access before and after it was developed as a city hospital connection. Overall, most development took place on the southern and eastern sides of the hospital, where a number of transport facilities had been built, while the north side was left retained.</p>
<p>Prior to development, this area did not need to handle a crowd. In terms of its transport facilities, there was a car park, which was on the east side of hospital road, used for the public and the staff of the hospital. Besides that, there were some bus stops on both sides of the hospital road. As part of the development program, three main roads - Ring Road, which encircles the hospital, Hospital Road, and City Road had largely been retained, with some structural work fitting around existing roads.</p>
<p>Following construction, although the area was more developed, the City Hospital was unchanged. In terms of access, there were two roundabouts on both sides of Hospital Road, which connected to the Ring Road and City Road. In terms of transport facilities, while a bus station had been built for people who come to this Hospital, all bus stops had been removed. Reaching the hospital had been made easier with the addition of a public car park on the east side of the hospital; the old car park was reserved for staff.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You gave a clear <strong>overall summary</strong>, identifying that most development happened in the south and east.</p></li>
<li><p>You <strong>covered all key features</strong>: roads, car parks, roundabouts, bus station, and removal of bus stops.</p></li>
<li><p>The use of passive voice (<em>had been built</em>, <em>was reserved</em>) is appropriate for describing map changes.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Some factual inaccuracies and unclear phrasing reduce precision:</p></li>
<li><p>‚ùå ‚Äúnorth side was left retained‚Äù ‚Üí grammatically incorrect; and factually unclear. There‚Äôs no major feature on the north side of the hospital that should be described as ‚Äúretained.‚Äù</p>

<li><p>‚ùå ‚Äúthree main roads‚Ä¶ had largely been retained‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Üí This sentence is confusing; you listed the roads as if they were new, then said they were retained. Also, the roads weren‚Äôt developed structurally‚Äîthe development was around them.</p></li>
<li><p>The task required clear before/after comparisons. Your timeline control is a bit weak in parts. For example:</p>
<p>‚ÄúFollowing construction, although the area was more developed, the City Hospital was unchanged.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚úÖ Better: ‚ÄúAfter redevelopment, the hospital building itself remained unchanged, while the surrounding infrastructure was significantly upgraded.‚Äù</p></li>

<p>‚úÖ Strengths:</p>
<p>Good use of sequencing phrases: ‚ÄúPrior to development,‚Äù ‚ÄúFollowing construction,‚Äù ‚ÄúIn terms of‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
<p>Logical paragraph structure with clear division: before vs.&nbsp;after.</p>
<p>üîß Areas for Improvement:</p>

<p>Repetition of ‚ÄúIn terms of‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äî try synonyms like ‚ÄúRegarding,‚Äù ‚ÄúWith respect to,‚Äù ‚ÄúConcerning,‚Äù etc.</p>
<p>Sentences sometimes lack clarity due to poor syntax:</p>

<p>‚úÖ Strengths:</p>
<p>You use some appropriate map-related vocabulary: roundabouts, bus station, hospital road, car park, retained, facilities.</p>
<p>üîß Issues:</p>
<p>Some inaccurate or awkward word choices:</p>
<p>‚Äúthe area did not need to handle a crowd‚Äù</p>
<p>‚úÖ Better: ‚Äúthe area had limited traffic demand before development‚Äù</p>
<p>‚Äúused for the public and the staff of the hospital‚Äù ‚Üí too wordy</p>
<p>‚úÖ Better: ‚Äúused by both the public and hospital staff‚Äù</p>

<p>The two maps show before and after road access was improved to serve the City Hospital. Overall, most development took place on the southern and eastern sides of the hospital, where a number of transport facilities had been built, while the hospital building itself remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Prior to development, the area had limited traffic demand. In terms of its transport facilities, there was a car park, which was on the east side of hospital road, used by both the public and hospital staff. Additionally, there were some bus stops on both sides of the hospital road.</p>
<p>After redevelopment, the hospital building itself remained unchanged, while the surrounding infrastructure was significantly upgraded. Regarding access, there were two roundabouts on both sides of Hospital Road, which connected to the Ring Road and City Road. Concerning access features, while a bus station had been built for hospital visitors, all bus stops had been removed. Access to the hospital was improved by the addition of a public car park on the east side of the hospital; the old car park was reserved for staff.</p>
<p>üîπ 1. Task Achievement:</p>
<p>‚úÖ What‚Äôs good:</p>
<p>You clearly identify changes between the two maps: bus station, car parks, roundabouts, etc.</p>
<p>You correctly state that the hospital building itself remained unchanged.</p>
<p>You use appropriate comparisons between before and after.</p>
<p>You included specific features with accurate location references (east side, both sides of Hospital Road, etc.)</p>
<p>üîß To improve:</p>
<p>The phrase ‚Äúdeveloped as a city hospital connection‚Äù is a little unclear or awkward. Better phrased as:</p>
<p>‚úÖ ‚Äú‚Ä¶developed to improve road access to the City Hospital‚Äù</p>
<p>‚úÖ OR: ‚Äú‚Ä¶developed to enhance transportation infrastructure around City Hospital.‚Äù</p>
<p>üîπ 2. Coherence and Cohesion:</p>
<p>‚úÖ What‚Äôs good:</p>
<p>Paragraphs are well-organized: introduction, before, after.</p>
<p>Clear linking: ‚ÄúPrior to development,‚Äù ‚ÄúAfter redevelopment,‚Äù ‚ÄúAdditionally,‚Äù ‚ÄúRegarding access,‚Äù ‚ÄúConcerning access features‚Äù.</p>
<p>üîß Suggestions:</p>
<p>Try not to repeat phrases like ‚Äúthe hospital building itself remained unchanged.‚Äù You used this twice in two paragraphs. Rephrase or omit the second mention.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>After redevelopment, while the hospital remained the same, major upgrades were made to the surrounding transport infrastructure.</p>
<p>‚ÄúConcerning access features‚Äù is a bit unnatural/formal. Instead, use:</p>
<p>‚úÖ ‚ÄúIn terms of transport facilities‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
<p>‚úÖ ‚ÄúWith regard to public transport‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
<p>üîπ 3. Lexical Resource:</p>
<p>‚úÖ Strengths:</p>
<p>Strong topic vocabulary: ‚Äútransport facilities,‚Äù ‚Äúinfrastructure,‚Äù ‚Äúredevelopment,‚Äù ‚Äúhospital visitors,‚Äù ‚Äúreserved for staff‚Äù</p>
<p>Accurate prepositions: ‚Äúon the east side,‚Äù ‚Äúconnected to‚Äù</p>
<p>üîß Suggestions:</p>
<p>Consider varying ‚Äúaccess‚Äù a bit more to avoid repetition. You use ‚Äúaccess‚Äù in multiple forms (road access, access features, reaching the hospital).</p>
<p>You can use:</p>
<p>‚Äútransport links‚Äù</p>
<p>‚Äúconnection routes‚Äù</p>
<p>‚Äúentry to the hospital was improved‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
<p>üîπ 4. Grammatical Range and Accuracy:</p>
<p>‚úÖ What‚Äôs good:</p>
<p>Good range of sentence structures: relative clauses, passive voice, present perfect/passive</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>*‚Äú‚Ä¶a bus station had been built for hospital visitors‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚úÖ Excellent use of past perfect passive.</p>
<p>üîß Errors to Fix:</p>
<p>‚ùå ‚Äú‚Ä¶road access before and after it was developed as a city hospital connection.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚úÖ Awkward and not idiomatic</p>
<p>‚úÖ Better: ‚Äú‚Ä¶before and after road access was improved to serve the City Hospital.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ùå ‚Äú‚Ä¶Reaching the hospital had been made easier‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
<p>‚úÖ Better: ‚ÄúAccess to the hospital was improved by the addition of a public car park‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>

<section id="sample-band-8-model-for-comparison" class="level1" data-number="4">
<h1 data-number="4"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Sample Band 8 Model (for comparison)</h1>
<p>The two maps illustrate the road access to City Hospital before and after improvements made in 2007.</p>
<p>Overall, while the hospital building itself remained unchanged, major developments were made to the surrounding infrastructure, particularly to traffic flow, parking, and public transport facilities.</p>
<p>Before the changes, Hospital Road was directly accessible from City Road, with bus stops located on either side of Hospital Road. A single car park, situated to the east of the hospital, served both staff and public.</p>
<p>Following redevelopment, two roundabouts were added‚Äîone at the intersection of Hospital Road and City Road, and another where Hospital Road meets the Ring Road. These roundabouts improved traffic circulation. A new bus station was constructed on the west side of Hospital Road and is now accessible via the roundabouts. The original car park is now reserved for hospital staff, and a new public car park was built to the east, accessible via a new road off the ring road.</p>

<p>Write:</p>
<p>The line graph shows the consumption of fish and three types of meat by each person in a European country over a 25-year period from 1979 to 2004.</p>
<p>Overall, it is clear that the minority of food consumption came from fish throughout the period, and the general trend was to move away from beef and lamb as chicken became the dominant meat source of this category.</p>
<p>In the first decade, beef consumption was the highest in the food categories listed. Despite reaching a low of about 150 grams, it then recovered to reach a high of about 230 grams per week. However, after 1988, beef consumption fell almost continuously, and by 2004 had almost 120 grams. Lamb almost exactly mirrored the fluctuation pattern of beef. Falling from the second-highest number at 150 grams in 1979 to approximately 60 grams per week by the end of the period.</p>
<p>In contrast, chicken began the period at below 150 grams in 1979, to took the lead from around 1989 onwards. Especially, the rise in chicken corresponds to the decline of beef and lamb, and by 2002, it hit a peak of about 260 grams before slightly dropping to 250 grams in 2004.</p>
<p>Fish was consistently eaten the least, beginning at around 60 grams per week, then dropping to below 50 grams. While it was the lowest, it remained relatively stable for the majority of the period.</p>
<ul>
<li>improve phrasing like:</li>
</ul>
<p>‚Äúto took the lead from around 1989 onwards‚Äù -&gt; ‚Äúand overtook the other meats and fish in consumption from around 1989‚Äù</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid vague or incorrect causal links:</li>
</ul>
<p>‚Äúespecially, the rise in chicken corresponds ‚Ä¶‚Äù -&gt; ‚ÄúNotably, the increase in chicken consumption coincided with a decline in both beef and lamb.‚Äù</p>
<p>-&gt;</p>
<p><em>Chicken consumption, which started below 150 grams per person per week in 1979, steadily increased and surpassed all other meats by 1989.</em></p>
<p><em>Meanwhile, fish remained the least consumed protein throughout the entire period, showing minimal fluctuation.</em></p>
<p>not: ‚Äúminority of food consumption came from fish‚Äù</p>
<p>-&gt;: ‚ÄúFish accounted for the smallest proportion of consumption.‚Äù</p>
<p>not: ‚Äúhit a peak of about 260 grams‚Äù</p>
<p>-&gt; ‚Äúpeaked at approximately 260 grams per person per week.‚Äù</p>
<p><em>Lamb followed a similar declining trajectory to beef, although its figures were consistently lower.</em></p>
<p><em>Chicken consumption rose steadily, eventually surpassing all other meat types.</em></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Fragments like: <em>‚ÄúFalling from the second-highest number at 150 grams‚Ä¶‚Äù</em> must be restructured:</p>

<p>Sample:</p>
<p>The line graph illustrates the weekly per-person consumption of fish and three types of meat in a European country between 1979 and 2004.</p>
<p><strong>Overall</strong>, while meat was consumed in significantly greater quantities than fish throughout the period, the general trend shows a decline in beef and lamb consumption and a sharp increase in chicken, which eventually became the most consumed meat.</p>
<p>In 1979, beef consumption was the highest, at over 200 grams per person per week. Although it dropped to around 160 grams early in the period, it recovered to a peak of 230 grams before experiencing a continuous decline after 1988, reaching just over 100 grams by 2004. Lamb followed a similar but less pronounced downward trend, falling steadily from 150 grams to approximately 60 grams.</p>
<p><strong>By contrast</strong>, chicken consumption began below 150 grams but rose steadily, overtaking both lamb and beef around 1989. It peaked at 260 grams per person in 2002 before slightly falling to 250 grams in the final year.</p>
<p>Fish consumption remained the lowest throughout the period, starting at around 60 grams and showing only a slight decline to just under 50 grams by 2004.</p>

<section id="overviewtrend-statements" class="level1" data-number="1">
<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Overview/Trend Statements</h1>
<p>In <strong>IELTS Academic Writing Task 1</strong>, the <strong>overview paragraph</strong> is a <strong>summary of the most noticeable features</strong> or <strong>overall trends</strong> in the visual data (chart, graph, table, map, process, etc.).</p>
<p>It usually comes after the introduction and should:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Highlight general patterns</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid specific data (no numbers!)</p></li>
<li><p>Use academic and formal language</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Focus on what stands out or changes clearly</p>
<p>Use umbrella terms for not too specific or detailed.</p>
<p>Do not include personal opinion, avoid using more extreme adjectives such as amazing, drastic, fascinating, remarkable, ‚Ä¶. # Comparative Structures</p>
<p>Used to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Compare countries, categories, years, or items</p></li>
<li><p>Highlight differences or similarities between data points</p></li>
<li><p>Achieve a high score in Coherence &amp; Cohesion + Grammatical Range</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Comparative structures allow you to describe how one value is higher, lower, more, or less than another.</p>
<p>This is essential in IELTS Writing Task 1, where you must compare numerical data across:</p>
<p>Countries</p>
<p>Years</p>
<p>Age groups</p>
<p>Product categories</p>
<p>Sectors or industries</p>
<p>Using accurate and varied comparative grammar helps you score Band 7+ in both Task Achievement and Grammatical Range.</p>

</ul>
<p>A <strong>relative clause</strong> (also called an <strong>adjective clause</strong>) gives <strong>extra information</strong> about a <strong>noun</strong> in the sentence. It starts with a <strong>relative pronoun</strong> such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>who</em> (for people)</p></li>
<li><p><em>which</em> (for things or ideas)</p></li>
<li><p><em>that</em> (for people or things ‚Äì less formal)</p></li>

<li><p><em>where</em> (for places)</p></li>
<li><p><em>when</em> (for time)</p></li>

<p>In <strong>IELTS Academic Writing Task 1</strong>, when a data trend <strong>shows no significant change</strong>, we describe it as being <strong>stable</strong>, <strong>unchanged</strong>, or <strong>constant</strong>.

<p>Overall, women were generally more physically active than men across most age groups, with the exception of those aged 15 to 24. While male participation increased with age, female activity levels remained relatively stable and consistently higher throughout adulthood. The gender gap was most pronounced in the 25 to 34 age group but narrowed again among those aged 65 and over.</p>
<p>In the youngest age category (15 to 24), a higher percentage of males (52.8%) participated in regular physical activity compared to females (47.7%). This was the only age group where men were more active than women, indicating a reversal of the general trend observed in the other age groups.</p>
<p>From age 25 onwards, female participation in physical activity consistently exceeded that of males. The most significant difference was seen in the 35 to 44 group, where only 39.5% of men exercised regularly compared to 52.5% of women - a gap of over 13 percentage points. As men grew older, their activity levels gradually increased, reaching 45.1% by the 55 to 64 group. However, they still lagged behind women, whose activity levels remained steady at around 52-53%.</p>
<p>Among those aged 65 and above, the gender gap in physical activity levels almost disappeared. Approximately 47.1% of women and 46.7% of men reported being physically active, making this the only age group where the figures for both genders were nearly equal.</p>

<p>The bar chart shows the percentage of men and women in Australia who did regular physical activity in 2010. The data is divided into six different age groups.</p>
<p>Overall, women were more active than men in most age groups, except for the youngest group. The biggest difference between genders can be seen in people aged 25 to 34, while the activity levels for older people were more similar.</p>
<p>In the 15 to 24 age group, men were slightly more active than women, with 52.8% of males doing regular physical activity compared to 47.7% of females. This was the only age group where men were more active than women, indicating a reversal of the general trend observed in the other age groups.</p>
<p>From age 25 onwards, female participation in physical activity consistent exceeded that of males. Among those aged 35 to 44,</p>
<p>In the oldest group, aged 65 and over, the figures were almost the same: 46.7% for men and 47.1% for women. This was the only age category where the gender gap almost disappeared.</p>

<p>The bar chart shows the proportion of Australian males and females across six age groups who engaged in regular activity in 2010.</p>
<p>Overall, women tended to be more physically active than men in most age groups, except among the youngest group, where males had a slightly higher participation rate. From age 25 onwards, female participation in physical activity consistently exceeded that of males.</p>
<p>Among 15 to 24-year-olds, approximately 52.8% of men were physically active, slightly more than the 47.7% of women in the same age range. This is the only age group in which male activity rates were higher than female rates.</p>
<p>From age 25 to 64, women were consistently more active than men. The most notable difference occurred in the 25 to 34 age group, where nearly half of the women (48.9%) were active compared to only 42.2% of men. This gender gap remained relatively steady in the following age brackets, with female activity rates hovering around 52%-53%, while male figures gradually increased from 39.5% (age 35-44) to 45.1% (age 55-64).</p>
<p>In the oldest age group (65 and over), the activity levels of men and women were nearly identical, with 46.7% of males and 47.1% of females participating in regular physical activity, showing minimal gender difference by this stage of life.</p>

<p>The line graph illustrates the average carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions per person in four European countries - the United Kingdom, Sweden, Italy, and Portugal - over a 40-year period from 1967 to 2007.</p>
</section>
<section id="overview" class="level2" data-number="1.2">
<h2 data-number="1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Overview</h2>
<p>Overall, while the UK and Sweden experienced significant declines in per capita emissions, Italy and Portugal saw upward trends. By the end of the period, the emissions levels of all four countries became more closely aligned, despite their very different starting points.</p>
</section>
<section id="paragraph-1-uk-and-sweden" class="level2" data-number="1.3">
<h2 data-number="1.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="paragraph-1-uk-and-sweden"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Paragraph 1: UK and Sweden</h2>
<p>In 1967, the United Kingdom had by far the highest CO2 emissions, at approximately 11 metric tonnes per person. However, this figure steadily declined over the 40-year period, reaching just over 8 tonnes in 2007. Sweden followed a similar pattern: emissions rose slightly from 9 to a peak of about 10 tonnes in 1997, before dropping sharply to just over 5 tonnes by the end of the period.</p>
</section>
<section id="paragraph-2-italy-and-portugal" class="level2" data-number="1.4">
<h2 data-number="1.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="paragraph-2-italy-and-portugal"><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Paragraph 2: Italy and Portugal</h2>
<p>In contrast, both Italy and Portugal showed rising trends. Italy‚Äôs emissions increased gradually from about 4 tonnes in 1967 to around 7.5 tonnes in 2007, overtaking Sweden in the late 1980s. Portugal, which began with the lowest emissions at roughly 1 tonne per person, saw a consistent rise throughout the period, reaching levels similar to Sweden by 2007.</p>
<p>Conversely, both Italy and Portugal experienced upward trends in carbon emissions over the period. Italy‚Äôs figures rose steadily from approximately 4 metric tonnes in 1967 to nearly 7.5 tonnes by 2007, surpassing Sweden sometime in the late 1980s. Meanwhile, Portugal, which started with the lowest per capita emissions at around 1 tonne, recorded a continual increase and reached a level comparable to that of Sweden by the end of the timeframe.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What are the biggest challenges cities face today?</strong><br>
‚Üí ‚ÄúOne major issue coastal cities face is climate-related flooding. Many were built near sea level, and older infrastructure like drainage channels are now ineffective.‚Äù</p>
<p><strong>Q: Should countries work together to tackle environmental issues?</strong><br>

<p>You chose:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>E: enjoy new challenges</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sounds like good advice, but it&nbsp;<strong>wasn‚Äôt actually said</strong>.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs the relevant part:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>‚ÄúMost of you have very little or no experience‚Ä¶ and the first week may be quite challenging‚Ä¶‚Äù</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>She&nbsp;<strong>acknowledges</strong>&nbsp;that it may be challenging ‚Äî but she&nbsp;<strong>never says</strong>&nbsp;‚ÄúEnjoy it!‚Äù or ‚Äúembrace challenges.‚Äù She actually says:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry too much‚Ä¶ check with someone‚Ä¶‚Äù</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So she‚Äôs saying the first week may be hard, but she‚Äôs not giving the&nbsp;<strong>advice</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<em>enjoy</em>&nbsp;the challenge. So&nbsp;<strong>E is an interpretation</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>not actual advice</strong>. - Only choose answers that are&nbsp;<strong>directly supported by the exact wording</strong>&nbsp;in the audio.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Do&nbsp;<strong>not infer advice</strong>&nbsp;unless the speaker clearly gives it as advice.</p></li>

<p>Totally understandable ‚Äî&nbsp;<strong>but here‚Äôs the key</strong>&nbsp;in IELTS logic:</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>‚ÄúCompany policy for apprentices‚Äù</strong></p>

<p>So, the phrase&nbsp;<strong>‚ÄúBooking holidays‚Äù</strong>&nbsp;in this question is specifically asking about&nbsp;<strong>during the apprenticeship</strong>&nbsp;(i.e., the 6 months).</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>‚ùå No holidays are allowed&nbsp;<strong>at all</strong>&nbsp;during your apprenticeship.<br>
‚úÖ Only if you are&nbsp;<strong>unwell</strong>&nbsp;can you take time off.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs a&nbsp;<strong>ban during the apprenticeship</strong>&nbsp;‚Äî not a restriction, but a&nbsp;<strong>prohibition</strong>. Therefore:</p>

<p><strong>Q: What are the biggest challenges cities face today?</strong><br>
‚Üí ‚ÄúOne major issue coastal cities face is climate-related flooding. Many were built near sea level, and older infrastructure like drainage channels are now ineffective.‚Äù</p>
<p><strong>Q: Should countries work together to tackle environmental issues?</strong><br>
‚Üí ‚ÄúAbsolutely. Cities can‚Äôt deal with these problems in isolation ‚Äî international collaboration is key.‚Äù</p>

<p>At QUESTION 10. I feels TRUE because the word ‚Äòrelated‚Äô , i think i can choose TRUE.</p>
<p>When read the statement, I thought that: ‚ÄúAccommodation is&nbsp;<strong>related</strong>&nbsp;to 26% of satisfaction‚Äù ‚Üí meaning it‚Äôs&nbsp;<strong>included</strong>&nbsp;in that 26%.</p>
<p>I saw the word <strong>related to</strong>, which seems close to <strong>account for</strong>, and I know <strong>accommodation is part of</strong> that 26%.</p>
<p>But the key logic problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>The statement claims: all 26% is related to accommodation.</li>
<li>The text says: transport AND accommodation together account for 26%.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, accommodation is related.</p>
<p>But not <strong>all of the 26%</strong> is related to accommodation.</p>

<p>A recent study on international students found that&nbsp;<strong>70% of them were satisfied with the quality of teaching</strong>, while&nbsp;<strong>30% mentioned issues with accommodation and cost of living.</strong><br>
The report also highlighted that&nbsp;<strong>students prefer studying in cities with strong public transport systems</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>cultural diversity</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;70% of international students were satisfied with both teaching and accommodation.<br>

C. NOT GIVEN</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;Cost of living is a concern for 30% of international students.<br>
A. TRUE<br>
B. FALSE<br>
C. NOT GIVEN</p>

<p>1B, just teaching 2B, in include accommodation 3C, i dont see that information (it is assuming of the sentence ..)</p>
<p><strong>Why:</strong>&nbsp;The passage says students&nbsp;<strong>‚Äúprefer cities with strong public transport‚Äù</strong>, but that&nbsp;<strong>doesn‚Äôt mean</strong>&nbsp;they&nbsp;<em>avoid</em>&nbsp;places without it.

<p>At question 28</p>
<p>You read that people were ‚Äúworried‚Äù about computer art and assumed this was because&nbsp;<strong>humans might become worse</strong>&nbsp;at art or creativity ‚Äî a&nbsp;<em>decline in human ability</em>.</p>
<p>This is a&nbsp;<strong>reasonable guess</strong>, but IELTS doesn‚Äôt test guesses. You must match ideas&nbsp;<em>exactly</em>.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>‚ÄúThey are worried that it is taking something special away from what it means to be human.‚Äù</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That ‚Äú<strong>something special</strong>‚Äù is clearly&nbsp;<strong>human creativity</strong>, which is described as a&nbsp;<strong>core human trait</strong>. So the concern isn‚Äôt about becoming&nbsp;<strong>worse</strong>&nbsp;at art; it‚Äôs about&nbsp;<strong>losing what makes us unique</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Option D</strong>&nbsp;implies a&nbsp;<strong>skill-level decline</strong>&nbsp;‚Äî like artists becoming lazy or less creative.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Option C</strong>&nbsp;talks about&nbsp;<strong>existential value</strong>&nbsp;‚Äî human creativity as a part of&nbsp;<em>our identity</em>.</p></li>

<p>Correct Answer:</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong>&nbsp;achieves a particularly striking effect</p>
<p>You saw the phrase ‚Äú<strong>technical glitch</strong>‚Äù and thought it showed a&nbsp;<strong>limitation</strong>, which is logical on the surface.</p>

<p><em>Honestly, I think it‚Äôs our over-connected lifestyle. There‚Äôs so much passive consumption -videos, scrolling, noise - that it paradoxically leads to a lack of meaningful engagement.

<p><em>One creative activity I‚Äôve come to enjoy deeply is writing short stories. I began doing it during university, especially during those quiet moments of indifferent boredom when I felt mentally under-stimulated. Strangely, boredom sparked my imagination, letting my mind wander freely. I believe creativity often flourishes in those conditions. Writing allows me to explore ideas and emotions I can‚Äôt always express verbally. Sometimes I think of it like programming imagination into words, similar to how artificial intelligence tools like the Painting Fool are programmed to generate art. But unlike machines, my creativity stems from real emotional experiences. That personal input makes it fulfilling and cathartic.</em></p>

</blockquote>
<p><em>One of the most memorable educational experiences I‚Äôve had was attending a creativity workshop during high school. It was organized to help students break away from rigid academic routines and think outside the box. We weren‚Äôt given clear instructions- instead, we had to solve a real-world problem in teams. Initially, some of us felt a bit of ‚Äòcalibrating boredom‚Äô, unsure of what to do, but that actually pushed us to explore ideas more creatively. That session taught me that boredom isn‚Äôt necessarily negative- it can push us to innovate when we‚Äôre given freedom.</em></p>

<p><em>It‚Äôs a fascinating question. Computers can simulate creativity through algorithms, like the Painting Fool or EMI composer program.

  <title>Compound sentence</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>A sentence can contain more than one sentence within it, for example:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Jane put the glass vase on the table and her mother picked it up.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is an example of a compound sentence. It actually contain two sentences. The first is <em>Jane put the glass vase on the table</em>. Since a sentence within a sentence is called a clause, we can also say that sentence 1 contains two clauses. Just as a simple sentence must contain at least a subject and a verb phrase, each of the sentences (clauses) within a compound sentence must contain its own subject and verb phrase.</p>
<p>Recall, conjunctions like <em>and, or, but</em> join things. In fact, the two sentences within sentence 1 are joined by the conjunction <em>and</em>. Recall also that there are two kinds of conjunctions, coordinating and subordinating. The sentences in a compound sentence are joined together by a coordinating conjunction. There are three common coordinating conjunctions they are <em>and, or,</em> and <em>but</em>. Four less common ones are <em>for, so, yet</em>, and <em>nor</em>. (FANBOYS)</p>
<section id="exercises" class="level1" data-number="1">
<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Exercises</h1>
<p>Each of the sentences below is a compound sentence consisting of two sentences (clauses). Underline each of the sentences which is in the compound sentence. Sample: I felt restless after breakfast and I wandered around the house.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><u>Andre pulled the car into the street</u>, and <u>Beth began reading the directions</u>.</p></li>
<li><p><u>She enjoyed shopping for food</u>, but <u>she especially enjoyed cooking</u>.</p></li>
<li><p><u>I can do this now</u>, or <u>I can do it later</u>.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Dan does not feel well</u>, yet<u> he wants to go in to work</u>.</p></li>
<li><p><u>We missed our flight</u>, so <u>we have to wait around the airport for the next available one</u>.</p></li>
<li><p><u>He does not like to change his mind</u>, nor <u>is he willing to compromise</u>.</p></li>
<li><p><u>You deserve your good fortune</u>, for <u>you have a heart of gold.</u></p></li>
<li><p><u>The players are running onto the field</u>, and <u>then they are beginning to practice</u>.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Stephanie likes to go to concerts</u>, but <u>she will not see an opera</u>.</p></li>
<li><p><u>You can pay with cash</u>, or <u>you can take out a loan</u>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Decide if each sentence below is a simple sentence or a compound sentence. Remember that a simple sentence contains just one sentence (clause) while a compound sentence contains at least two sentences joined by a coordinating conjunction. Sample:Wallace stared at him in the grocery store. simple</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>He can‚Äôt blame her for the problem. (simple)</li>
<li>Beth left the library, and she headed straight home. (compound sentence)</li>
<li>He was watching her, but she was pretending not to notice. (compound)</li>
<li>We like him a lot. (simple)</li>
<li>The coach wants to win, but he will be happy with a tie. (compound)</li>
<li>It will be a sunny day. (simple)</li>
<li>Jeremy likes his wife‚Äôs new dress. (simple)</li>
<li>I will have a bowl of soup, but I don‚Äôt want salad. (compound)</li>
<li>Sam called me at noon. (simple)</li>
<li>He will be going to Penn State, or he‚Äôll study at Temple University. (compound)</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>A compound sentence can contain more than two sentences:</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Nora was Zach‚Äôs stepmother but she treated him like her other children and he trusted her completely.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here, the <u>three</u> sentences that make up this sentence are: (1) <em>Nora was Zach‚Äôs stepmother</em>; (2) <em>she treated him like her other children</em>; (3) <em>he trusted her completely</em>. So the sentence <em>There was a glass vase on the table and Jane picked it up</em> contains two sentences, or clauses. In fact, a compound sentence can contain any number of sentences, though we usually limit ourselves to just a few:</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>He turned his head away and he pretended to ignore her but he continued to listen to her and in fact he hung on her every word. (4 sentences or clauses)</li>
</ol>
<p>Keep in mind that you can‚Äôt tell if a sentence is simple or compound by how long it is; you need to see if it contains one or more than one complete sentence within it. For example, the following sentence, although it is long, is just a simple sentence:</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>The tall man with the violin case quickly climbed the stairs to the abandoned warehouse near the railroad tracks.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a simple sentence because it has just one subject, <em>the tall man with the violin case</em>, and one verb phrase - notice that there is just one verb, <em>climbed</em>. (The sentence is just long because it contains a few preposition phrases.) And the following sentence, although it is short, is a compound sentence: <em>John laughed and Mary cried</em>. It‚Äôs a compound sentence because it contains two sentences that can stand alone: <em>John laughed; Mary cried</em>. Each of these has its own subject and verb phrase.</p>

<h2 data-number="1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="exercises-1"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Exercises</h2>
<p>Each sentence below is either a simple or compound sentence. Identify the number of clauses in each sentence. If there is more than one clause in the sentence, underline each clause. Sample:The bear watched his movements closely. 1</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Vicki was always looking at herself in the mirror, but MaryAnn was extremely self-confident, and she never gave herself a second glance. 3</li>
<li>Her father was devoted to her. 1</li>
<li>Our firm‚Äôs CEO will be flying to Chicago next week, but he‚Äôll be returning the same day. 2</li>
<li>The lady in the elegant blue dress entered the well-lit room with her perky little dog in her arms. 1</li>
<li>Our boat was hit with strong winds, and we had to return to our cabins. 2</li>
<li>We don‚Äôt have much time left in the zoo, but we should visit the bird cage, and we must see the monkeys, or we should at least feed the goats in the petting area, but I definitely want to take a look at the elephants. 5</li>
<li>We can catch a movie, or we can visit a museum, but we won‚Äôt be seeing a Broadway show. 3</li>
<li>Many people walk in the woods in autumn. 1</li>
<li>The economy is getting worse, and many people are worried about their jobs. 2</li>
<li>My car is getting old, and it‚Äôs pretty banged up, but I hope to get another year out of it. 3</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Keep in mind that a compound <u>phrase</u> is not the same thing as a compound <u>sentence</u>. For example, the following sentence has a compound noun phrase.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>The teacher graded <u>the student‚Äôs exam and their papers</u>.</li>
</ol>
<p>We‚Äôve certainly got a coordinating conjunction, <em>and</em>, in sentence 5. However, the question is, what the <em>and</em> joining? If we look at what‚Äôs on each side of the <em>and</em>, we find the following: <em>The teacher graded the student‚Äôs exams</em>, which is a sentence, and <em>their papers</em>; <em>their papers</em> is not a sentence by itself. In this case, the conjunction <em>and</em> is joining two noun phrases: <em>the students‚Äô exams</em> and <em>their papers</em>. It‚Äôs not joining two complete sentences, and so the sentences is not a compound sentence but is a simple sentence.</p>

<p>PART 2: ADJECTIVE CLAUSES # An Introduction to Relative Clauses</p>

<p>A complex sentence is a sentence that contains an independent clause and one or more subordinate clauses.</p>
<p>Subordinate clauses can be classified as adverb clauses, <strong>adjective clauses</strong>, or noun clauses.</p>
<p>Those subordinate clauses that function as adjectives are known as <strong>relative clauses</strong>.</p>
<p>Relative clauses begin with one of the following <strong>relative pronouns</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>who, what, which, whom, whose, what, when, where, why</em>. We are going to focus on three that we use most often in our writing: <em>who, that</em>, and <em>which</em>. Examples:</p></li>
<li><p>I met a man {who had lost the ability to cry or sing}. (The independent clause <em>I met a man</em> + the relative clause <em>who had lost the ability to cry or sing</em>).</p></li>
<li><p>There came a dream of hopes {that never yet had flushed his cheek}. (The independent clause <em>there came a dream of hopes</em> + the relative clause <em>that never yet had flushed his cheek</em>).</p></li>
<li><p>The speaker spoke of youth, {which night and time have quenched forever}. (the independent clause <em>the speaker spoke of youth</em> + the relative clause <em>which night and time have quenched forever</em>).</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="the-medial-position" class="level1" data-number="1">
<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> The Medial Position</h1>
<p>In the previous lesson, we took our first look at relative clauses. Each of the sentences contained in that lesson features a relative clause in the <strong>terminal position</strong> (the position to the right of an independent clause): - Independent clause + relative clause. However, relative clauses may also appear in the <strong>medial position</strong>: The terms <em>introductory, medial,</em> and <em>terminal</em> help us to refer to key places within a sentence. Quite simply:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>introductory</strong> = at the beginning</li>
<li><strong>medial</strong> = in the middle</li>
<li><strong>terminal</strong> = at the end</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is an example of a relative clause in the medial position:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The man {who had lost the ability to cry or sing} <strong>was sitting</strong> in the corner. Here, the relative clause <em>who had lost the ability to cry or sing</em> sits in the medial position - between the subject <em>man</em> and the verb <em>was sitting</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>The hopes {that never yet had flushed his cheek} <strong>would</strong> soon <strong>be realized</strong>. Here, the relative clause <em>that never yet had flushed his cheek</em> sits in the medial position - between the subject <em>hopes</em> and the verb <em>would be realized</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Youth, {which night and time have quenched forever}, cannot be recaptured. Here, the relative clause <em>which night and time have quenched forever</em> sits in the medial position-between the subject <em>youth</em> and the verb <em>can be recaptured</em>.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="subjects-and-verbs-in-sentences-with-relative-clauses" class="level1" data-number="2">
<h1 data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Subjects and Verbs in Sentences with Relative Clauses</h1>
<p>Relative clauses are clauses that function as adjectives. How so? Three <strong>relative clauses</strong>, with their subjects and verbs marked:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>who</em> <strong>fall</strong> in love</p></li>
<li><p><em>that</em> <strong>sits</strong> in the center of the circle</p></li>
<li><p><em>which</em> <strong>remained</strong> obscure in the mind of his listeners</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these word groups is a clause because each contains a subject and a verb. Each is subordinate because each is unable to stand alone as its own independent sentence.</p>
<p>To gain their status as clauses, these word groups cheat a bit: they use their own relative pronouns as subjects. They lack independence because their subject are not true subjects. The relative pronouns that serve as subjects (<em>who, that,</em> and <em>which</em>) cannot exist without the <strong>antecedents</strong> they point to.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs take the three relative clauses from above and add them to some independent clauses.</p>
<section id="complex-sentence-1" class="level3" data-number="2.0.1">
<h3 data-number="2.0.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="complex-sentence-1"><span class="header-section-number">2.0.1</span> Complex Sentence 1</h3>
<ul>
<li>People {<em>who</em> <strong>fall</strong> in love} <strong>know</strong> the movement of time.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this example, the medial relative clause sits between the primary subject and verb.</p>
<ul>
<li>primary subject-verb: <em>people know</em></li>
<li>secondary subject-verb: who fall</li>
</ul>
<p>With the relative clause <em>who fall in love</em>, we find that the relative pronoun <em>who</em> serves not only as the clause‚Äôs first word, but also as its subject. Because <em>who</em> is a pronoun, it exists courtesy of an <strong>antecedent</strong> it can point to - which happens to be <em>people</em>, the subject of the independent clause. In this case, the subject of the relative clause is linked to the subject of the independent clause via pronoun-antecedent connection.</p>
</section>
<section id="complex-sentence-2" class="level3" data-number="2.0.2">
<h3 data-number="2.0.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="complex-sentence-2"><span class="header-section-number">2.0.2</span> Complex Sentence 2</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The <em>object</em> {<em>that</em> <strong>sits</strong> in the center of the circle} <strong>resembles</strong> a silver tear. In this example, the medial relative clause once again sits between the primary subject and verb.</p></li>
<li><p>primary subject-verb: object resembles</p></li>
<li><p>secondary subject-verb: that sits</p></li>
</ul>
<p>With the relative clause <em>that sits in the center of the circle</em>, we find that the relative pronoun <em>that</em> serves not only as the clause‚Äôs first word, but also as it subject. Because <em>that</em> is a pronoun, it exists courtesy of an antecedent it can point to- which happens to be <em>object</em>, the subject of the independent clause. Once again, we find that the subject of the relative clause is linked to the subject of the independent clause.</p>
</section>
<section id="complex-sentence-3" class="level3" data-number="2.0.3">
<h3 data-number="2.0.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="complex-sentence-3"><span class="header-section-number">2.0.3</span> Complex Sentence 3</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The <em>chatterer</em> <strong>provided</strong> no details in support of his statement, {<em>which</em> <strong>remained</strong> obscure in the mind of his listeners}. In this example, the relative clause is not in the medial position, as it was in the two previous examples, but in the terminal position.</p></li>
<li><p>primary subject-verb: chatterer provided</p></li>
<li><p>secondary subject-verb: which remained</p></li>
</ul>
<p>With the relative clause <em>which sits in the center of the circle</em>, we find that the relative pronoun <em>which</em> serves not only as the clause‚Äôs first word, but also as its subject. Because <em>which</em> is a pronoun, it exists courtesy of an antecedent it can point to, which happens to be the noun <em>statements</em>, not the subject <em>chatterer</em>. We see, then, that when relative clauses are moved to positions further from the primary subject, the subjects of the two clauses no longer maintain a pronoun-antecedent connection.</p>

<h2 data-number="2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-makes-relative-clauses-adjectival"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> What makes relative clauses adjectival?</h2>
<p>We need to demonstrate that relative clauses do, in fact, function as adjectives. Let‚Äôs use the three example sentences we saw earlier:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>People</em> {<em>who</em> <strong>fall</strong> in love} <strong>know</strong> the movement of time. Here, the relative clause <em>who fall in love</em> is describing the noun <em>people</em>; thus it is functioning as an adjective.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>object</em> {<em>that</em> <strong>sits</strong> in the center of the circle} <strong>resembles</strong> a silver tear. Here, the relative clause <em>that sits in the center of the circle</em> is describing the noun <em>object</em>; thus it is functioning as an adjective.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>chatterer</em> <strong>provided</strong> no details in support of his statement, {which <strong>remained</strong> obscure in the mind of his listeners}. Here, the relative clause <em>which remained obscure in the mind of listeners</em> is describing the noun <em>statements</em>; thus it is functioning as an adjective.</p></li>

<p>Here we will focus on the adjectival quality of relative clauses by identifying relative clauses and the nouns those clauses are describing.</p>

<section id="restrictive-and-nonrestrictive-relative-clauses" class="level1" data-number="3">
<h1 data-number="3"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Restrictive and Nonrestrictive Relative Clauses</h1>
<p>Some of the relative clauses have been punctuated with commas, some without. This is because relative clauses are either <strong>restrictive</strong> or <strong>nonrestrictive</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>restrictive</strong> = no commas</li>
<li><strong>nonrestrictive</strong> = commas Here is the difference between the two: Often, restrictive clauses serve the purpose of narrowing the possibilities within a group; nonrestrictive clauses serve no such purpose.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, suppose we have a group of actors. During rehearsal that day some actors attend rehearsal; some did not. By using a restrictive relative clause, we can reduce the larger group of <em>all</em> actors to a smaller group - those who didn‚Äôt attend rehearsal.</p>
<ul>
<li>The actor {<em>who</em> failed to attend rehearsal} were forgetting their lines.</li>
</ul>
<p>When we use relative clauses, we must be consciously aware of our purpose in using them: Are we restricting a larger group (restrictive clause)? Or are we just adding additional information (restrictive clause)? We must also be conscious of our punctuation choice: Are we restricting a large group? (If so, we don‚Äôt use commas). Or are we just adding additional information? (If so, we do use commas.)</p>

<p><em>Who</em> and <em>Whom</em> are actually two forms of the same word: <em>who</em> is the <strong>subjective</strong> form and while <em>whom</em> is the <strong>objective</strong> form.</p>
<p>At this point, we could digress into an explanation of the subjective case and the objective case- but we won‚Äôt. Instead, we‚Äôll take a shortcut by learning this general rule:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Whom</em> is followed by a noun or pronoun; <em>who</em> is followed by a verb. Study these two examples:</p></li>
<li><p>This Earth has been peopled with the servants <em>whom</em> <strong>you require</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>I am the only man <em>who</em> <strong>writes in the margins</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In each example, the relative clause is boldfaced and the relative pronoun is italicized. Notice that <em>whom</em> is followed by the pronoun <em>you</em> and <em>who</em> is followed by the verb <em>writes</em>.</p>

<p>Another function of the objective relative pronoun <em>whom</em> is to serve as the object of a preposition. The preposition category includes such words as <em>at, below, by, for, from, in, of, on, through, to,</em> and <em>with</em>.</p>
<p>Using <em>whom</em> as the object of a preposition allows us to perform the following trick. This trick can be performed with any relative clause that ends with a preposition.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>He was the kind of knight <em>whom</em> ladies could be proud <strong>of</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, we take the preposition (of) from the end of the relative clause and move it to the front of the relative clause:</p>
<ul>
<li>He was the kind of knight <strong>of</strong> <em>whom ladies could be proud</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>One more example, with the relative clause in the medial position:</p>
<ul>
<li>The people <em>whom you smiled <strong>on</strong></em> were warmed to the heart. -becomes-</li>
<li>The people <em><strong>on</strong> whom you smiled</em> were warmed to the heart.</li>
</ul>
<p>This simple trick can lend a more formal and stylish tone to our writing.</p>

<p>In each sentence below, move the preposition from the end of the relative clause to the front of the relative clause. Note the more elevated tone that results. For this one, you might try voicing your results out loud. 1. I knew one like you whom this city gave welcome to.</p>

<h1 data-number="7"><span class="header-section-number">7</span> Reduction of Relative Clauses</h1>
<p>We must also learn to pay heed to this word of caution:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is often better to <strong>reduce</strong> relative clauses to shorter phrases.</li>
</ul>
<p>We often find that perfectly good phrases are hiding inside relative clauses, waiting to be freed. We free them by removing the relative pronoun (<em>who, that, which</em>) and the <em>to be</em> verb (<em>is, am, are, was, were</em>) that follows the relative pronoun.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example 1: The mountain, <strong>which was</strong> unconquered by those who scale it, cannot be mistaken for a molehill.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remove <em>which was</em> we get: <em>The mountain, unconquered by those who scale it, cannot be mistaken for a molehill.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Example 2: The nation adores its hermits, <strong>who are</strong> the preservers of solitude.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remove <em>who are</em> and we get: <em>The nation adores its hermits, the preservers of solitude</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Example 3: The tree <strong>that is</strong> growing in Eden embodies opposites in balance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remove <em>that is</em> and we get: <em>The tree growing in Eden embodies opposites in balance</em>.</p>
<p>Relative pronouns are also deletable when they are objective pronouns.</p>
<p>Examples: - The bed of flowers <del>that</del> she slept in ‚Ä¶ - The children <del>whom</del> she once raised ‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Each of the sentences below contains a relative clause, and each relative clause contains a phrase in need of liberation. Liberate those phrases by deleting the relative pronoun (who, that, which) and the to be verb (is, am, are, was, were). Simply read the sentences to yourself without voicing the two deletable words. 1. The billy goat, which is watching without judgment from behind his strange eyes, stands patient for two millennia.</p>

<p>PART 3: NOUN CLAUSES.</p>
<section id="creating-noun-clauses" class="level1" data-number="1">
<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Creating Noun Clauses</h1>
<section id="review" class="level2" data-number="1.1">
<h2 data-number="1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="review"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Review</h2>
<p>We began our study of complex sentences by learning that a complex sentence is an independent clause (a sentence) plus a subordinate clause. We learned that there are three types of subordinate clauses: adverb, adjective (the relative clause), and noun.</p>
<p>We have covered subordinate clauses of the adverb and adjective variety. The adverbial clauses appear to the left or the right of independent clauses and begin with subordinating conjunctions:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>after, as if, as long as, as soon as, although, as, as if, because, before, even if, if, since, so that, though, till, unless, until, when, whenever, wherever, while</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The adjectival clauses are relative clauses. We focused on three key relative pronouns: <em>who, that,</em> and <em>which</em>.</p>
<p>This bring us to our final clause type-the <strong>noun clause</strong>.</p>
<p>Like their cousins are adverbial and relative clauses, the noun clauses, too, begin with key words. We can call these key word <strong>noun-clause markers</strong>.</p>
<p>Here is a list:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>that, if, whether</em></li>
<li>{words that can be used to create question} <em>how, what, when, where, whom, why</em></li>
<li>{the -ever words} <em>however, whatever, whenever, wherever, whichever, whoever, whomever</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we take an independent clause (a sentence) and add a noun-clause marker to the front of it, we get a noun clause.</p>
<ul>
<li>noun-clause marker + independent clause = noun clause</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p><strong>take a sentences</strong>: <em>the foal was delivered by helicopter</em></p>
<p><strong>add a noun-clause marker</strong>: <em>that</em></p>
<p><strong>get a noun clause</strong>: <em>that the foal was delivered by helicopter</em></p>
<p>Once more:</p>
<ul>
<li>take a sentence: the Shah wanted it delivered</li>
<li>add a noun-clause marker: whenever</li>
<li>get a noun clause: whenever the Shah wanted it delivered.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a noun clause get added to an independent clause, the result is a complex sentence. Study two examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>example 1: <em>What the clown found so funny</em> was a mystery. (complex sentence? no)</li>
<li>example 2: We did not understand <em>why George was twitching in the forsythias</em> (complex sentence? yes)</li>
</ul>
<p>A complex sentence consists of an independent clause and at least one subordinate clause. Example 1 above consists of a noun clause plus a predicate (<em>was a mystery</em>) and, therefore, is not a complex sentence. In example 2, however, we do find one independent and one subordinate clause.</p>
<ul>
<li>independent clause: we did not understand</li>
<li>subordinate clause: why George was twitching in the forsythias</li>
</ul>

<p>Decide which noun-clause markers from the bulleted list below can be attached to which of the following sentences. (Not all noun-clause markers will work with all sentences.)</p>
<p>Keep in mind that you are creating noun clauses, not sentences. A noun clause is a type of subordinate clause and, therefore, cannot stand alone. In fact, the noun-clause marker you add is the word that converts what would have been an independent clause into a subordinate clause.</p>
<ul>
<li>noun-clause markers: that, if, whether, how, what, when, where, whom, why, however, whatever, whenever, wherever, whichever, whoever, whomever</li>

<p>Complex sentences take this form:</p>
<ul>
<li>independent clause + subordinate clause</li>
</ul>
<p>Noun clauses are one type of subordinate clause, so when we add noun clauses to sentences, we create complex sentences.</p>
<p>Noun clauses function as nouns; consequently, wherever we can place a noun, we can also place a noun clause. And we can test for <em>nounness</em> by using the key word <strong>something, somewhere,</strong> and <strong>someone</strong>. Whatever can replace any of these three words is a noun.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>We did not understand <em>something</em>.</li>
<li>We did not understand <em>why George was twitching in the forsythias</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In this example, the noun clause <em>why George was twitching in the forsythias</em> functions as a single noun.</p>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>When using noun clauses to create complex sentences, the number of forms such sentences can take is limited. The number of verbs can be used in the creation of complex sentences with noun clauses is also limited.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Here is a list of verbs that can precede noun clauses:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>accept, admire, adore, appreciate, ask, catch, cherish, claim, comprehend, covet, decide, demand, desire, despise, detest, doubt, enjoy, feel, hate, have, hear, know, lack, like, love, make, miss, own, prefer, realize, recognize, require, see, smell, take, taste, understand, value, want, wonder.</em></li>
</ul>

<h2 data-number="2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="exercises-1"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Exercises</h2>
<p>Step 1: Turn the second independent clause into a noun clause by adding a noun-clause marker to the front of it.</p>
<p>Step 2: Place the noun clause into the independent clause-simply replace the word <em>something</em>.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>first independent clause: you knew <em>something</em></li>
<li>second independent clause: the time was far away</li>
</ul>
<p>Step 1: second independent clause + noun-clause marker = <em>that the time was far away</em></p>
<p>Step 2: Insert the result of step 1 into the first independent clause = you knew that the time was far away.</p>
<p>Result? We have created a complex sentence containing a noun clause.</p>
<p><strong>Number 1</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>first independent clause: she understands <em>something</em></li>
<li>second independent clause: truth is a mix of gold and silver</li>
<li>noun clause-markers: that, if, whether, how, what, when, where, whom, why, however, whatever, whenever, wherever, whichever, whoever, whomever</li>
</ul>
<p>step 1: when truth is a mix of gold and silver</p>
<p>step 2: she understands when truth is a mix of gold and silver.</p>
<p><strong>Number 2</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>first independent clause: they did not comprehend <em>something</em></li>
<li>second independent clause: the duck had spoken to the drake</li>
</ul>
<p>step 1: whenever the ducker had spoken to the drake</p>
<p>step 2: they did not comprehend whenever the duck had spoken to the drake.</p>
<p><strong>Number 3</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>first independent clause: we loved <em>something</em></li>
<li>second independent clause: the weatherman would stop to bow</li>
</ul>
<p>step 1: if the weatherman would stop to bow</p>
<p>step 2: we loved if the weatherman would stop to bow.</p>

<h1 data-number="3"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Subjects and Verbs in Complex Sentences with Noun Clauses.</h1>
<p>Clauses contain one or more subjects and one or more verbs; noun clauses are no exception.</p>
<p>Here are two clauses with their subjects and verbs marked:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>how</em> the <em>cat</em> <strong>got</strong> into the pantry</li>
<li>why <em>he</em> <strong>had slept</strong> so late</li>
</ul>
<p>And here are two independent clauses with their subjects and verbs maked:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>We</em> <strong>could</strong> not <strong>tell</strong> something.</li>
<li><em>Jameson</em> <strong>began</strong> to <strong>explain</strong> something.</li>
</ul>
<p>By adding our noun clauses to the independent clauses, we get complex sentences consisting of one independent and one subordinate clause:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>We</em> <strong>could</strong> not <strong>tell</strong> something</p></li>
<li><p><em>We</em> <strong>could</strong> not <strong>tell</strong> {how the <em>cat</em> <strong>got</strong> in to the pantry}.</p></li>

<p>We have learned that a complex sentence consists of an independent clause (a sentence) and a dependent or subordinate clause. Once we understand this, we also understand that the study of complex sentences is really the study of subordinate clauses.</p>
<p>We have studied each type of subordinate clause: the adverb clause, the adjective (relative) clause, and the noun clause.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adverb clauses begin with subordinating conjunctions</strong>: <em>after, as if, as long as, as soon as, although, as, as if, because, before, even if, if, since, so that, though, till, unless, until, when, whenever, wherever, while</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Adjective (relative) clauses begin with relative pronouns</strong>: <em>who, that, which</em> (the three most commonly used).</li>
<li><strong>Noun clauses begin with noun-clause markers</strong>: <em>that, if, whether, how, what, when, where, whom, why, however, whatever, whenever, wherever, whichever, whoever, whomever</em>.</li>

<p>But wait a minute. If a word <em>that</em> can mark both relative clauses and noun clauses, how can we tell them apart?</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs do a comparison.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>relative clause</strong>: The trout <em>that swim in the center of the river</em> keep themselves safe.</li>
<li><strong>noun clause</strong>: I know <em>that the hand of God is the mirror of my own</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both examples contain a clause that begins with <em>that</em>. Let‚Äôs let RC stand for <em>relative clause</em> and NC stand for <em>noun clause</em>. There are three differences between these two clauses.</p>

<p>For each of the following complex sentences, identify the independent and the subordinate clause. For each subordinate clause, decide whether the clause is functioning as an adverb, an adjective, or a noun.</p>
<p>The clause markers are listed here:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>adverb clause markers (subordinating conjunctions): after, as if, as long as, as soon as, although, as, as if, because, before, even if, if, since, so that, though, till, unless, until, when, whenever, wherever, while</p></li>
<li><p>adjective (relative) clause markers (relative pronouns): who, that, which (the three most commonly used)</p></li>
<li><p>noun-clause markers: that, if, whether, how, what, when, where, whom, why, however, whatever, whenever, wherever, whichever, whoever, whomever</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>AFTER he thumped the jammed vending machine, the trooper walked home in his snowshoes. (The independent clause consists of which words? The subordinate clause consists of which words? What kind of clause is the subordinate clause: adverb, adjective, or noun?)</li>
</ul>
<p>independent clause: the trooper walked home in his snowshoes</p>
<p>subordinate clause: AFTER he thumped the jammed vending machine (adverb clause)</p>

<li>independent clause: I could not learn his mind</li>
<li>Subordinate clause: because he never knew it himself (adverb clause)</li>

<h1 data-number="5"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Mixed Clauses, Multiple Clauses</h1>
<p>The complex sentences we‚Äôve been studying represent the complex sentence at its most basic level: an independent clause (a sentence) with one subordinate clause. But in fact, complex sentence can contain mixed clauses (such as an adverb clause and a relative clause) or multiple clauses (such as three adverb clauses)</p>
<p>Here is an example of a complex sentence containing mixed clauses:</p>
<ul>
<li>{when Arjuna threw down his bow}, the warriors, {who were his cousins and kin}, ceased their fighting.</li>
</ul>
<p>This example contains an independent clause and two subordinate clauses: - <strong>independent clause</strong>: the warriors ceased their fighting. - <strong>adverb clause</strong>: when Arjuna threw down his bow. - <strong>relative clause</strong>: who were his cousins and kin.</p>
<p>Another example: - The crowd {that assembled on the sidewalks} would never understand {why he filled his conversation with so many foreign words}.</p>
<p>This example also contains an independent clause and two subordinate clauses:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>independent clause</strong>: the crowd would never understand.</li>
<li><strong>relative clause</strong>: that assembled on the sidewalks</li>
<li><strong>noun clause</strong>: why he filled his conversation with so many foreign words.</li>
</ul>
<p>Try out the next two examples independently. In the following example, see if we can identify an independent clause and <em>three</em> adverb clauses:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a teaspoonful of silkworm eggs endowed the church, when the letters of sacred testaments were unreeled in the coastal cities, when a bookworm conspired to enter the maze of empty roads, the rivers began flowing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The independent clause in that sentence is ‚Äòthe rivers began flowing‚Äô, and the three adverb clauses are: ‚Äòwhen a teaspoonful of silkworm eggs endowed the church‚Äô, ‚Äòwhen the letters of sacred testaments were unreeled in the coastal cities‚Äô, and ‚Äòwhen a bookworm conspired to enter the maze of empty roads‚Äô.</p>
<p>And in this next example, identify an independent clause and <em>two</em> relative clauses:</p>
<ul>
<li>All this takes place on my lawn, which has nothing to do with the seasons that roll lightly by.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this sentence, the independent clause is ‚ÄúAll this takes place on my lawn.‚Äù</p>
<p>The relative clause ‚Äúwhich has nothing to do with the seasons that roll lightly by‚Äù adds information about ‚Äúmy lawn.‚Äù</p>
<p>Within that, ‚Äúthat roll lightly by‚Äù is a second relative clause, modifying ‚Äúthe seasons.‚Äù</p>

<p>For each of the following, identify the independent and subordinate clauses.</p>
<p>For each subordinate clause, decide whether it‚Äôs an adverb clause, a relative clause (adjective), or a noun clause.</p>
<p>Before you begin, however, here are the answers to the last two examples you tried out on your own: - [WHEN a teaspoonful of silkworm eggs endowed the church], [WHEN the letters of sacred testaments were unreeled in the coastal cities], [WHEN a bookworm conspired to enter the maze of empty roads], the rivers began flowing.</p>
<p>independent: the rivers began flowing</p>
<p>adverb clause: WHEN a teaspoonful of silkworm eggs endowed the church</p>
<p>adverb clause: WHEN the letters of sacred testaments were unreeled in the coastal cities</p>

<section id="complex-vs.-compound-sentences" class="level1" data-number="6">
<h1 data-number="6"><span class="header-section-number">6</span> Complex Vs. Compound Sentences</h1>
<p>Before concluded our study of complex sentences, let‚Äôs see how the complex sentence compares with the compound sentence.</p>
<ul>
<li>Compound sentence: The parade is turning into our street, <em>for</em> the other streets have been barricaded.</li>
<li>complex sentence: The parade is turning into our street <em>because</em> the other streets have been barricaded.</li>
</ul>
<p>By studying these two examples, we note two differences: the comma and the conjunction. While complex sentences (those containing adverb clauses) are created with subordinating conjunctions (<em>although, because, when, etc</em>). Compound sentences are created with coordinating conjunctions (_for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so).</p>
<p>Stated this way, the difference between compound sentences and complex sentences seems light. And yet, they are treated as two different sentence categories. So that, really, is the difference between them?</p>
<p>Here is the difference: <em>Subordinating conjunctions attach to the right-hand sentence; coordinating conjunctions do not</em>.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs look at our two examples once again, except that this time we‚Äôll group the key components using bracket.</p>
<ul>
<li>Compound sentence: 1{The parade is turning into our street}, 2{for} 3{the other streets have been barricaded}.</li>
<li>Complex sentence: 1{The parade is turning into our street} 2{because the other streets have been barricaded}.</li>
</ul>
<p>The compound sentence consists of three components: (1) an independent clause, (2) a coordinating conjunction, and (3) a second independent clause. In other words, the coordinating conjunction <em>for</em> sits between the two clauses, independently and aloof.</p>
<p>The complex sentence consists of two components: (1) an independent clause (2) a subordinate (adverbial) clause. Here, the subordinating conjunction <em>attaches itself</em> to the subordinate clause.</p>
<p>In summary, it pays to understand the types of conjunctions and to be familiar with the conjunction groups that create which sentence types. Much of the work of distinguishing between simple, compound, and complex sentences can be boiled down to understanding the work being done by the conjunctions.</p>

<section id="compound-complex-sentences" class="level1" data-number="7">
<h1 data-number="7"><span class="header-section-number">7</span> Compound-Complex Sentences</h1>
<p>To qualify as a compound-complex sentence, a sentence must have at least three clauses, two of them independent and one of them subordinate.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs assemble a compound-complex sentence. We‚Äôll begin with our three clauses:</p>
<ul>
<li>he bid farewell to his loved ones</li>
<li>the knight set out on an adventure</li>
<li>re remained loyal to the queen</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we‚Äôll turn our first clause into a subordinate clause by adding the subordinating conjunction <em>after</em> to the front of it. We‚Äôll join the other two clauses with the coordinating <em>but</em>, giving us a compound-complex sentence that looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>compound-complex sentence: <em>After</em> he bid farewell to his loved ones, the knight set out on an adventure, <em>but</em> he remained loyal to the queen.</li>
</ul>
<p>The simplest way to approach compound-complex sentences is to begin with a compound sentence and to add a subordinate clause to that compound sentence.</p>
<p>A compound sentence is two independent clauses joined together.</p>
<ul>
<li>independent clause [ ] independent clause</li>
</ul>
<p>Once we‚Äôve established our compound sentence, we‚Äôll need to insert a subordinate clause. Here are four slots where subordinate clauses can be inserted:</p>
<ul>
<li><u>1</u> independent clause <u>2</u> [ ] <u>3</u> independent clause <u>4</u></li>
</ul>
<p>The first requirement of a compound-complex sentence is the existence of three clauses. The second requirement is a way to join (or coordinate) the two independent clauses. In other words, in the formula <em>independent clause [ ] independent clause</em>, what goes inside the brackets?</p>
<p>Answer: The space inside the brackets can be filled by a coordinating conjunction, a conjunction adverb, a semicolon, or a colon. Because we have so much new material to cover, let‚Äôs limit our options here to one of the seven coordinating conjunctions: <em>for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so</em>.</p>
<p>Then, for our subordinate clause-whether it be an adverbial, a relative, or a noun clause-we will need a head- or a clause-marking word to serve as the first word of the clause.</p>
<ul>
<li>If our clause is an adverb clause, we‚Äôll need a subordinating conjunction: <em>after, although, as, because, before, even if, if, since, so that, though, till, unless, until, when, whenever, wherever, while</em>.</li>
<li>If our clause is an adjective (relative) clause, we‚Äôll need a relative pronoun: <em>who, that, which</em></li>
<li>If our clause is a noun phrase, we‚Äôll need a noun-clause marker: <em>that, if, whether, how, what, when, where, whom, why, however, whatever, whenever, wherever, whichever, whoever, whomever</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now let‚Äôs bring all this together. Begin by studying the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 independent clause 2 [ ] 3 independent clause 4</li>
<li>1 the knight set out on an adventure 2 ; 3 <em>but</em> he remained loyal to the queen.</li>
</ul>
<p>The example above is a compound sentence consisting of two independent clauses joined by the coordinating conjunction <em>but</em>. To convert our compound sentence to a compound-complex sentence, we decide to place an adverbial subordinate clause in slot 1:</p>
<ul>
<li>{<em>After</em> he bid farewell to his loved ones}, {the knight set out on an adventure}; <em>but</em> {he remained loyal to the queen}.</li>
</ul>
<p>This compound-complex sentence consists of an adverbial subordinate clause sitting to the left (slot 1) of a compound sentence. Note that the three clauses are bracketed; note also the important role being played by the conjunctions <em>after</em> and <em>but</em>.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs try another one. We begin with a compound sentence (two clauses joined by <em>for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so</em>):</p>
<ul>
<li>1 {The hotel kept one pet} 2, <em>yet</em> {the guests would have been happy with a kitten} 4.</li>
</ul>
<p>We decide to add a subordinate clause-this time a relative clause- to slot 2:</p>
<ul>
<li>{The hotel kept one pet}, {<em>which</em> happened to be a racehorse}; <em>yet</em> {the guests would have been happy with a kitten}.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, note that the relative pronoun <em>which</em> is part of the clause it appears in.</p>
<p>In summary, compound-complex sentences can be created with five ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>clause 1</li>
<li>clause 2</li>
<li>clause 3</li>
<li><em>for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so</em> to make the sentence compound.</li>
<li>a creator of subordinate clauses: a subordinating conjunction, a relative pronoun, or a noun-clause marker.</li>
</ul>

<h1 data-number="8"><span class="header-section-number">8</span> Test Questions</h1>
<p>The Test Questions section contains thirty-six complex sentences, each containing one subordinate clause. Your task is to identify the subordinate clause in each of the sentences and to label that clause as either an adverb clause, a relative clause, or a noun clause.</p>
<p>Two of the word lists below‚Äîsubordinating conjunctions and noun-clause markers‚Äîcontain fewer members than the lists you‚Äôve been seeing throughout this e-book. These word lists contain just the words that are used in the test questions below.</p>
<p>Pay close attention to the word that. In the sentences that follow, that will be used at times as a relative pronoun and at times as a noun-clause marker. The difference between the two is discussed in Lesson 20.</p>
<ul>
<li>subordinating conjunctions (used to begin adverbial subordinate clauses): although, as, because, before, if, since, so that, though, till, until, when, while</li>
<li>relative pronouns (used to begin relative clauses): who, that, which</li>
<li>noun-clause markers (used to begin noun clauses): how, that, what, whatever, whether</li>

<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Rewritten Version (Band 7.5-8 model)</h1>
<p>The number of new residential constructions in the South and the West dropped steadily between 2006 and 2012. In 2006, approximately 900,000 new houses were built in the South, while the West recorded about 450,000. These figures fell significantly by 2008, reaching 450,000 and 200,000 respectively. Between 2008 and 2010, the decline continued, though more gradually, with the numbers dropping to 300,000 in the South and 150,000 in the West. However, by 2012, there was a slight increase, with around 310,00 homes constructed in the South and 160,000 in the West.</p>
</section>
<section id="higher-band-version" class="level1" data-number="2">
<h1 data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Higher band version</h1>
<p>Between 2006 and 2012, the number of new residential constructions in both the South and the West declined overall, though with minor fluctuations. In 2006, the South recorded approximately 900,000 new homes, while the West saw about half that figure at 450,000. By 2008, these numbers had dropped significantly to 450,000 in the South and 200,000 in the West. The downward trend continued more gradually over the next two years, reaching 300,000 and 150,00 respectively by 2010. However, 2012 saw a slight recovery, with new constructions rising modestly to around 310,000 in the South and 160,000 in the West.</p>

<p>The number of visitors to Dover increases overall throughout the year. In Spring, Dover recorded approximately 5,000 tourists. The Summer experiences a sharp climb to two times the figure of the before season. The upward trend continues more gradually over the next two seasons, reaching 15,000 in Autumn before having a peak at 25,000 in Winter.</p>

<p>‚úÖ You attempt a logical sequence: Spring ‚Üí Summer ‚Üí Autumn ‚Üí Winter.</p>
<p>‚ùå However, some sentence transitions are unnatural or slightly unclear.</p>
<p>‚ùå Use of linking phrases like ‚Äúbefore having a peak‚Äù is awkward and unidiomatic.</p>

<p>‚úÖ ‚Äútwice the number recorded in the previous season.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ùå ‚ÄúThe Summer experiences‚Äù ‚Üí incorrect article usage. Should be:</p>
<p>‚úÖ ‚ÄúIn summer, the number rose sharply‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ùå ‚Äúbefore having a peak‚Äù ‚Üí ungrammatical. Try:</p>
<p>‚úÖ ‚Äúbefore peaking at 25,000 in winter.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚úÖ You attempted complex structures, but several were awkward or incorrect.</p>
<p>Sample:</p>
<p>The number of visitors to Dover increased overall throughout the year. In Spring, the town welcomed approximately 5,000 tourists. This figure doubled in summer, rising sharply to 10,000. The upward trend continued at a more moderate pace, reaching 15,000 in autumn, before peaking at 25,000 in winter.</p>

<p>Engineering was the dominant choice for male students, comprising 45% of their total enrollment, more than twice the proportion of females in the same field (20%). In contrast, only 10% of men choose Humanities, while this subject attracted 30% of women, three times higher. Similarly, Education accounted for 35% of female enrollment, compared to just 20% of men.</p>
<p>üîç Detailed Analysis</p>
<p>üü¶ 1. Task Achievement (Band 7‚Äì8)</p>
<p>‚úÖ You cover key features and specific numbers.</p>
<p>‚úÖ You make comparisons between male and female enrollment.</p>
<p>‚ùå Minor inconsistency in the final sentence ‚Äî it‚Äôs Education that had 35% of women and 20% of men, which you got right, but the word ‚Äújust‚Äù is too informal here.</p>
<p>üü® 2. Coherence &amp; Cohesion (Band 7)</p>
<p>‚úÖ Clear overall structure and logical flow: from Engineering ‚Üí Humanities ‚Üí Education.</p>
<p>‚ùå ‚Äúthree times higher‚Äù is vague. It‚Äôs better to say: ‚Äúthree times the proportion‚Äù or ‚Äúthreefold that of men.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ùå Avoid ‚Äúsimilarly‚Äù unless the comparison is parallel ‚Äî Education and Humanities are different in structure.</p>
<p>üü• 3. Lexical Resource (Band 7)</p>
<p>‚úÖ Good use of: comprising, proportion, attracted, accounted for.</p>
<p>‚ùå Could vary with more formal phrases like:</p>
<p>‚Äúenrolled in‚Äù instead of ‚Äúchoose‚Äù</p>
<p>‚Äúconstituted‚Äù instead of ‚Äúaccounted for‚Äù</p>
<p>üü© 4. Grammatical Range &amp; Accuracy (Band 7)</p>
<p>‚úÖ Mostly correct grammar and comparatives.</p>
<p>‚ùå ‚ÄúChoose‚Äù ‚Üí should be past tense: chose (as you‚Äôre describing a chart, not a general truth)</p>
<p>‚ùå Minor article omission: ‚Äúmore than twice the proportion‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
<p>Rewrite: Engineering was the most popular subject among male students, accounting for 45% of their total enrollment, which was more than twice the proportion of females in the same field (20%). In contrast, only 10% of men chose Humanities, compared to 30% of women - three times the male figure. Likewise, Education attracted 35% of female students, while just 20% of male students enrolled in this subject.</p>

<p><strong>A collocation is a natural combination of words that native speakers commonly used together</strong></p>

<li><p>In&nbsp;<strong>IELTS Writing Task 2</strong>, use&nbsp;<strong>formal collocations</strong>&nbsp;for precision and sophistication:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>Government policies should&nbsp;<strong>tackle unemployment</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>reduce poverty</strong></em>.</p>
</blockquote></li>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>I always try to&nbsp;<strong>keep in touch</strong>&nbsp;with my old classmates.</em></p>

<li><p>Avoid overusing basic combinations like “very + adj” (e.g.,&nbsp;<em>very big</em>,&nbsp;<em>very cold</em>). Use high-level collocations:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>A&nbsp;<strong>considerable amount</strong>&nbsp;of money</em><br>

<p>When I left university I <strong>made a decision</strong> to take up a profession in which I could be creative. I could play the guitar, but I’d never written any songs. Nonetheless, I decided to become a singer-songwriter. I made some recordings but I had a <strong>rather heavy cold</strong>, so they didn’t <strong>sound good</strong>. I made some more, and sent them to a <strong>record company</strong> and waited for them to reply. So, while I was waiting to become famous, I got a job in a <strong>fastfood</strong> restaurant. That was five years ago. I’m still doing the same job.</p>

  <title>Academic discussion: Lead-in phrases</title>
  <dc:creator>Hung </dc:creator>
  <link>https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/grammar-academic-discussion-lead-in-phrases/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Many lead-in phrases are used to structure academic discussion: to introduce ideas cautiously, challenge ideas, invite opinions, etc. Some of these make use of reporting structures.</p>
<section id="reporting-structures-to-introduce-ideas-cautiously-and-challenge-ideas" class="level1" data-number="1">
<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Reporting structures to introduce ideas cautiously and challenge ideas</h1>
<p>In academic discussion we tend to introduce an idea or opinion cautiously, as it often just one point of view, not an objective fact. One way to do this to preface the idea with a reporting clause. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>I should/ would think that</strong> we’ll still be using fossil fuels in 20 years time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>I shoundn’t/ wouldn’t think that</strong> anyone would object to the decision.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Even more cautiously we can use <strong>I should(n’t)/ would(n’t) have thought that</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>I should/ would have thought that</strong> there wouldn’t be any danger to animals. Or</p>
<p><strong>I shouldn’t/ wouldn’t have thought that</strong> there would be any danger to animals.</p>
<p>Note that we avoid using two negatives. (<em>not</em> I wouldn’t/ shouldn’t have thought there wouldn’t be any danger to animals.)</p>
<p>In some contexts we can use the same patterns to politely challenge what another speaker has said:</p>
<p>A: I’ll be targeting 40 to 60 year olds in the experiment.</p>
<p>B: Well, <strong>I shouldn’t have thought</strong> the age of the subjects would make any difference. (= I don’t think that)</p>
</section>
<section id="reporting-structures-to-invite-opinions" class="level1" data-number="2">
<h1 data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Reporting structures to invite opinions</h1>
<p>One way to invite another speaker to present an idea or opinion or to expand on one already presented is by using a <strong>wh-clause</strong> with certain reporting verbs:</p>
<p>A: The results show a preference for self-service over personal service in stories.</p>
<p>B: <strong>Why do you think (that)</strong> self-services is so popular?</p>
<p>A: I’ll live stream the lecture to students off campus. B: <strong>Where do you intend to</strong> position the camera?</p>
<div class="callout callout-style-default callout-note callout-titled">
<div class="callout-header d-flex align-content-center">
<div class="callout-icon-container">
<i class="callout-icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="callout-title-container flex-fill">
Note
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Other verbs used in this way include: <strong>anticipate, feel, imagine, reckon, recommend, suggest, suppose</strong> (may be followed by <em>that</em>); <strong>consider, expect, propose, want</strong> (usually followed by a <em>to</em>-infinitive)</p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<section id="other-lead-in-phrases" class="level1" data-number="3">
<h1 data-number="3"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Other lead-in phrases</h1>
<p>Many other lead-in phrases are used to structure academic discussion:</p>
<p>A: <strong>In a way</strong>, the Internet has completely changed the way we communicate. (reducing the force of the statement)</p>
<p>B: <strong>So you mean</strong> that it has improved communication? (asking for clarification)</p>
<p>A: Not necessarily, no. <strong>What I’m saying is</strong> that … (clarifying an opinion)</p>

<p>Ana: I’ve been doing some reading on this. (1) As far as I can see, NASA plan to prioritize crewed rather than robotic missions, and I think that’s right. Humans can respond to problems in a way that computers never can. Take Apollo 13, for instace.</p>
<p>Beto: (2) I take your point, but robotic missions can go on for years in a way that crewed missions can’t.</p>
<p>Carla: Yes, I agree. There are so many disadvantages of a crewed over a robotic mission. (3) For one thing, it’s so much more expensive, and then there’s the risk the lives of the astronauts.</p>
<p>Ana: (4) So what you’re saying is that we should never send people into space?</p>
<p>Beto: No.&nbsp;(5) What I mean is that it’s a better use of money - and much safer - to use robotic missions. (6) That’s not to say that a robotic mission can do everything a crewed mission can, but robotic missions should take priority.</p>
<p>Dan: (7) To be honest, I’ve no idea which is better. There are so many pros and cons of each.</p>

<section id="referring-to-other-work-as-passive-past-participle" class="level1" data-number="1">
<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Referring to other work: as + passive / past participle</h1>
<p>In academic writing and speaking we can make references to other people’s work using a clause with <strong>as + passive</strong></p>
<p>The first approach should be discarded as it makes wrong predictions about word order, <strong>as is argued</strong> in Frascarelli and Hinter (2007).</p>
<p>Past usage experience had a major impact on consumer decision behaviour, <strong>as has been shown</strong> in a number of recent studies.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Note that we don’t use <em>it</em> in this type of clause. (<em>not</em> … as it is argued by … <em>or</em> as it has been shown …)</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>More commonly we use a reduced passive form - <strong>as + past participle</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>As noted</strong> by Kerr (2004) these figures were a significant underestimate.</p>
<p>Both temperature and moisture were important in explaining the abundance of fungi, <strong>as demonstrated</strong> in previous studies (e.g.&nbsp;Lam, 2002; Rich at al., 2014)</p>

</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p><em>Also:</em> __as + argued, described, discussed, illustrated, indicated, mentioned, pointed out, shown, suggested_</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Using a passive or reduced passive to refer to the work of others often indicates, in an impersonal way, that we agree with them:</p>
<ul>
<li>The basic communicative goal of scientific research articles, <strong>as suggested by Bird (2009)</strong>, is to convey the results of scientific inquiry.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using an active verb is more neutral and may be followed either by agreement or disagreement:</p>

<h1 data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Referring to other parts of a written text: as + past participle</h1>
<p><strong>As + past participle</strong> is also commonly used by writers to refer to tables and figures in their own texts, and is referred to more personal forms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>As (is) seen in the following chart</strong>, interest rates are lower now than in the last 30 years. (<em>rather than</em> As you see in the following chart …)</li>
<li>During her first 32 weeks of talking, Keren acquired 337 words, <strong>as shown in Figure 2-2</strong>.</li>

<p><em>Also:</em> <strong>demonstrated, depicted, described, discussed, explained, given, illustrated, indicated, outlined</strong></p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>As + past participle</strong> is also used to refer to other sections of a text with adverbs such as <strong>above</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>As discussed above</strong>, exploration of the Moon will provide insights into the formation of the Solar System</p>

<h1 data-number="3"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Referring to other parts of a spoken presentation</h1>
<p>When we refer to other parts of a presentation we are giving, we tend to use time adverbs, not location adverbs:</p>
<ul>
<li>As I said <strong>before</strong>, … (<em>not</em> As I said above …)</li>
<li>… as I’ll come back to <strong>later on</strong>. (<em>not</em> … as I’ll come back to below)</li>
</ul>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div class="">
<p><em>Also:</em> <strong>already, earlier, previous; next</strong></p>
</div></div><p>Other grammatical structures commonly used in referring backwards and forwards in spoken presentations include <strong>what-clauses</strong> and <strong>-ing-clauses</strong>. Examples are highlighted in these extracts from a presentation:</p>
<p><strong>Coming back to the earliest development of language</strong>, it’s been estimated that it originated around 40,000 years ago … <strong>What I want to go on to next</strong> is the development of written language … Language gave people the ability to think and plan, <strong>as I pointed out previously … Returning to my point about</strong> the development of written language … <strong>What we’ll do next weeks is</strong> begin to look at non-verbal communication…</p>

  <title>Linking ideas in academic writing and speech</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<section id="a" class="level1" data-number="1">
<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> A</h1>
<p><em>Sentence connectors, conjunctions</em> and <em>pro-forms</em> are used to link ideas in academic writing and speaking in a number of ways.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Sentence connectors</em> link sentences. There is usually a full stop at the end of the first sentence, and the sentence connector often comes at the start of the next.</li>
<li><em>Conjunctions</em> link clauses within sentences. A comma often separates the clauses. Most conjunctions come at the start of their clause.</li>
<li><em>Pro-forms</em> are general words or phrases that refer back to more specific words or phrases, avoiding repetition.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<p><strong>In sum</strong><sup>1</sup>, temperature is an important factor determining the shelf life of a food product <strong>in that</strong><sup>2</sup> variations in temperature can result in the growth of microorganisms which can cause the product the spoil. <strong>Furthermore</strong><sup>3</sup>, incorrect freezing can damage the proteins of meat or other products. <strong>Given that</strong><sup>4</sup> the maintenance of the correct temperature over a long period is essential, it is necessary to use time temperature indicators. Studies have shown that these indicators reduce food waste considerably. <strong>As well</strong><sup>5</sup>, they reduce the number of foodborne illnesses.</p>
<p>Sociology researchers use two types of information: primary data and secondary data. <strong>The former</strong><sup>6</sup> is collected by the researcher themselves, <strong>whereas</strong><sup>7</sup> secondary data already exists in some form, such as documents or previous research. Collecting primary data can be time-consuming and expensive, and <strong>as such</strong><sup>8</sup>, undergraduate researchers often prefer to use secondary data.</p>
</section>
<section id="b---in-speaking" class="level1" data-number="2">
<h1 data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> B - In Speaking</h1>
<p>Some sentence connectors, conjunctions and pro-forms used in writing have equivalent words or phrases which are more common in speaking. Compare these extracts from a spoken presentation with the text in A:</p>
<p><strong>To put it briefly</strong>, temperature is an important factor …</p>
<p><strong>The reason for this is that</strong> variations in temperature can result in …</p>
<p><strong>On top of that</strong>, incorrect freezing can damage …</p>
<p><strong>Taking into account that</strong> the maintenance of the correct temperature …</p>
<p><strong>Also</strong>, they reduce the number …</p>
<p>Here are more examples of formal linking words and phrases. Possible informal alternatives are given in brackets, although these will not substitute for the more formal linking word or phrase in every context.</p>

<p>‘Biodiversity’ is the abbreviated word for ‘biological diversity’. <strong>The latter</strong> -&gt; <font color="#00b050">The last / the second</font> term appears to have come into use in the early 1980s, when Bruce Wilcox defined it <strong>as follows</strong>-&gt; <font color="#00b050">in this way/ like this</font>: “the variety of life forms … at all levels of biological systems - molecular, organismic, population species and ecosystem”. <strong>Hitherto</strong> -&gt; <font color="#00b050">Before this/ that</font>, the terms ‘species diversity’ or ‘species richness’ were used. So the term ‘biological diversity’ - <strong>subsequently</strong>-&gt; <font color="#00b050">after that</font> ‘biodiversity’ is relatively new. <strong>That said</strong> -&gt; Having said that, philosophers and scientists have studied many aspects of biodiversity over hundreds of years. Even Aristotle, working nearly two and a half thousand years ago, studied biodiversity <strong>in that</strong>-&gt; <font color="#00b050">because</font> he looked for similar patterns in organisms so that he could group them together.</p>
<p><strong>Also and Further</strong>:</p>
<p>“Also” = addition of a related fact or statistic</p>
<p>It’s used here to add another data point about the same group (those who skipped breakfast).</p>
<p>It shows that skipping lunch is an additional behaviour from the same participants.</p>
<p>“Also, 15% of these…” = In addition to skipping breakfast, they also skipped lunch.</p>
<p>❌ Why not “further”?</p>
<p>“Further” is more formal and usually used to:</p>
<p>Introduce an additional argument or point in a discussion, not another data point.</p>
<p>Often appears in Task 2 essays (not typically Task 1).</p>
<p>✅ Example of correct use of “further”:</p>
<p>Further research is needed to understand the long-term effects of this trend.</p>
<p>So in IELTS Writing Task 1, where you’re presenting facts and data, “also” is usually more appropriate for connecting related statistics.</p>

<p>‘Considering’ and ‘Bearing in mind’</p>
<p>The photographs were in superb condition, ___ they were taken over a century ago.</p>
<p>✅ Correct answer (from the book): considering</p>
<p>✅ Why “considering” is the better answer here:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Grammatical Structure – Short, Integrated Clause</li>
</ol>
<p>“Considering” can be used without “that” and still form a natural, concise clause:</p>
<p>…considering they were taken over a century ago. ✅</p>
<p>✅ This flows smoothly within the sentence.</p>
<p>“Bearing in mind” often sounds heavier, and more natural when followed by “that” or used in separate clauses:</p>
<p>…bearing in mind that they were taken…</p>
<p>✅ Correct, but wordier and less idiomatic in this kind of sentence.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Tone and Register – Concise Descriptive Language</li>
</ol>
<p>In this context, you’re describing a surprising or notable fact, and “considering” is the most natural and idiomatic choice.</p>
<p>“Bearing in mind” feels more reflective or argumentative, and is better suited for conclusions or commentary, such as:</p>
<p>Bearing in mind the results, we can conclude that…</p>
<p>✅ Used more in academic or spoken reasoning, not as clean in description.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Common Usage in Writing</li>
</ol>
<p>Native speakers and academic writers frequently use “considering” in descriptive clauses:</p>
<p>It’s surprisingly warm, considering it’s still February.</p>
<p>She did well, considering how little time she had.</p>
<p>✅ This structure is frequent and natural in written English.</p>

<p>Example in Spoken IELTS:</p>
<p>The star Betelgeuse is cooler than the Sun — around 3,500 Kelvin. To put it another way, it’s only about half as hot as our Sun.</p>
<p>❌ Less Natural for Speaking:</p>
<p>That is to say, it is about half the temperature of the Sun.</p>
<p>→ Feels too formal or mechanical in a spoken explanation.</p>
<p>🧠 Tip for IELTS Speaking:</p>
<p>Use “to put it another way” when:</p>

<p>Example in Academic Context (IELTS Writing Task 2):</p>
<p>There are several problems with this policy. Firstly, it may discourage innovation. Secondly, it lacks transparency.</p>
<p>❌ Less Appropriate:</p>
<p>The study has several limitations. First of all, the sample size was small.</p>
<p>→ Sounds slightly too informal for IELTS academic writing.</p>
<p>🧠 Band 8+ Writing Tip:</p>
<p>When organizing ideas in IELTS Writing Task 2 (or Task 1 GT letters), prefer:</p>
<p>Firstly, Secondly, Finally</p>
<p>In addition, Moreover, Furthermore</p>
<p>On the one hand, On the other hand</p>

  <title>Expressing and reporting opinions: it-clauses</title>
  <dc:creator>Hung </dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<section id="expressing-opinions-impersonally" class="level1 page-columns page-full" data-number="1">
<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Expressing opinions impersonally</h1>
<p>In academic communication, we tend to be impersonal, focusing more on actions, we effects of actions, and the things affected by actions rather than the people performing the actions. We often use <em>it-</em> clauses to express opinions impersonally in academic writing and speaking. Common patterns here:</p>
<p><strong><em>it</em> + be (adverb) + adjective + <em>to-</em> infinitive</strong></p>
<p>e.g.&nbsp;<strong>It is extremely difficult to evaluate</strong> the role of tourism in urban renewal.</p>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div class="">
<p><em>Other adjectives</em> commonly used in this pattern: <strong>(in)convenient, easy, hard, important, (im)possible, interesting, (un)necessary, (un)reasonable, (in)sufficient, useful</strong></p>
</div></div><p><strong><em>it</em> + be + (adverb) + adjective + <em>that</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>It is quite possible that</strong> a larger sample size would have shown different results.</p>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div class="">
<p><em>Other adjectives</em> commonly used in this pattern: <strong>apparent, (un)clear, (in)conveivable, doubtful, essential, evident, important, (un)likely, obvious, probable, true</strong></p>
</div></div><p>Note that not all adverbs and adjectives in these patterns can combine. For example, we commonly use <strong>quite + possible/ clear</strong>, nut rarely <strong>quite + doubtful/ essential</strong></p>
<p>We often use a passive verb form in an <strong>it- clause</strong> with <strong>that</strong> when we report another person’s opinion. Notice that we usually include a reference to the other person’s work, often immediately after the reporting verb or at the end of the sentences:</p>
<p><strong>It has been reported</strong> (Crane, 2015) <strong>that</strong> prolonged periods sitting in front of a computer may have significant health risks.</p>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div class="">
<p>Verbs commonly used in this pattern:<br>
<strong>argue*</strong>, <strong>claim*</strong>, <strong>contend*</strong>, <strong>demonstrate</strong>, <strong>estimate</strong>, <strong>maintain*</strong>, <strong>note</strong>, <strong>propose*</strong>, <strong>report*</strong>, <strong>show</strong>, <strong>suggest*</strong></p>
</div></div></section>
<section id="distancing-yourself-from-a-point-of-view" class="level1" data-number="2">
<h1 data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Distancing yourself from a point of view</h1>
<p>We often use an <strong>it-clause</strong> when we want to distance ourselves from an earlier point of view, perhaps because it is now disputed, or because we feel there was some limitation or problem with the earlier work:</p>
<p><strong>It has been claimed that</strong> cheese intake is associated with high cholesterol levels (Zemel, 2001), but more recent studies have found that cheese may even have a cholesterol lowering effect (Hamedi, 2018; Allen, 2019)</p>
<p><strong>It is often suggested that</strong> air pollutants from traffic, such as nitrogen oxide (NO2) and suspended particulate matter have a negative impact on child health (e.g.&nbsp;Janssen, 2004, Knape 2012). However, relatively few studies so far have looked at the health of children living near busy roads.</p>
<p>The reporting verbs mark * in Above margin note are often used in this way.</p>
</section>
<section id="disagreeing" class="level1" data-number="3">
<h1 data-number="3"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Disagreeing</h1>
<p>In academic contexts we often begin a disagreement by acknowledging that some part of the opposing position is true. <em>Its-clauses</em> are often used for this in academic writing and also in spoken academic contexts (presentation, seminars, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>It is sometimes argued that</strong> it is important for students to outline their essays before beginning writing (e.g.&nbsp;Cotton, 2004). While <strong>it is quite correct that</strong> much of an essay can be planned in advanced, <strong>it must also be noted that</strong> the act of writing itself facilities thought and shapes ideas.</p>
<p><strong>It’s often assumed that</strong> environmental sustainability and poverty reduction can go hand-in-hand. Although <strong>it’s certainly possible to find</strong> a small number of examples where this happens, in most cases in the literature <strong>it is reported that</strong> the costs of environmental improvement fall on the poor rather than the wealthy.</p>
<p>However, in less formal spoken contexts we sometimes prefer more personal forms. For example: <strong>We often assume that …, … you can certainly find …</strong>.</p>

  <title>Complex noun phrases and complex prepositions</title>
  <dc:creator>Hung </dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<section id="complex-noun-phrases" class="level1 page-columns page-full" data-number="1">
<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Complex noun phrases</h1>
<p>Long, complex noun phrases are typical of academic writing, allowing a lot of information to be included within one sentence element. They can make up <sup>1</sup> substantial parts of academic texts as subjects, objects, and complements. The complex noun phrases in this extract are in italics with the main noun in each phrase in bold.</p>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div class="">
<p><strong>🔍 “make up” (phrasal verb)</strong><br>
Means:<br>
- <strong>form</strong><br>
- <strong>constitute</strong><br>
- <strong>compose</strong></p>
<p>📘 Example meaning:<br>
&gt; Complex noun phrases <strong>make up</strong> (= form) large parts of academic writing.</p>
</div></div><p>The <strong>changes</strong> in map data collection and representation that have arisen with the introduction of computers and digital techniques are remarkable. <strong>Information</strong> that used to be collected manually from surveys and ground observations can now be collected almost instantaneously by orbiting <strong>satellites</strong> that send data to Earth at the speed of light. <strong>Maps</strong> that were once hand-drawn can now be produced on a computer and printed out in a relatively short <strong>amount</strong> of time.</p>
<p>Note the word order in complex noun phrases -</p>
<ul>
<li>The most common elements <em>before</em> the main noun in a complex noun phrase are: determiners (e.g.&nbsp;<em>a, the</em>), and adjectives (<em>e.g.&nbsp;orbiting</em>)</li>
<li>The most common elements <em>after</em> the main noun are: relative clauses (<em>e.g.: that were once hand-drawn</em>), and adjectives (<em>e.g.&nbsp;orbiting</em>)</li>
<li>After the main noun in particular, elements are often embedded within others. For example, the relative clause <em>that have arisen with the introduction of computers</em> includes the prepositional phrase <em>with the introduction of computers</em> which in turn includes the prepositional phrase of <em>computers</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In academic writing we tend to use nouns to talk about <em>actions</em> and <em>processes</em> (more typically associated with verbs), and <em>qualities</em> (more typically associated with adjectives). This use of a noun to convey a meaning usually expressed with a word from another class is referred to as <em>nominalization</em>, and this process often results in a complex noun phrase. Compare the noun phrases in these two texts:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>Organizations have reported that <strong>the number of people volunteering has decreased rapidly</strong> in recent years. At the same time, <strong>more opportunities to volunteer have become available</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>An extremely rapid decrease in volunteering</strong> has been reported in recent years. At the same time, <strong>the availability of opportunities to volunteer has increased</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Where (i) uses a verb (<em>has decreased</em>) and adjective (<em>available</em>), (ii), more typical of academic writing, uses nouns (<em>decrease, availability</em>).</p>
</section>
<section id="complex-prepositions" class="level1" data-number="2">
<h1 data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Complex prepositions</h1>
<p>Complex prepositions comprise two, three or four words. Some of these occur more frequently in academic writing than in general use. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>As for</strong> the future, demand for electricity is expected to grow at a rate of 5% per annum. (= regarding)</li>
<li>The final chapter considers inequalities in health <strong>with reference to</strong> race and gender. (= what it is about)</li>
<li>Monthly average temperatures were higher than average <strong>with the exception of</strong> June. (= not including)</li>
</ul>
<div class="collum-margin">
<p>Also: <strong>as a result of, as distinct from, as opposed to, depending on, in comparison with, in line with, in the case of, irrespective of, on the part of, prior to, regardless of</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Note that four-word prepositions usually end in <em>of</em> and include an article.</p>
<p>Complex prepositions often occur as part of complex noun phrases:</p>
<ul>
<li>This essay has discussed <em>class identity</em> <strong>with reference to</strong> <em>gender differences</em>.</li>
<li>The study found a <em>less positive attitude</em> <strong>in the case of</strong> <em>customers exposed</em> to <em>advertising and marketing communications</em>.</li>

<p>The two maps show road access before and after it was developed as a city hospital connection. Overall, most development took place on the southern and eastern sides of the hospital, where a number of transport facilities had been built, while the north side was left retained.</p>
<p>Prior to development, this area did not need to handle a crowd. In terms of its transport facilities, there was a car park, which was on the east side of hospital road, used for the public and the staff of the hospital. Besides that, there were some bus stops on both sides of the hospital road. As part of the development program, three main roads - Ring Road, which encircles the hospital, Hospital Road, and City Road had largely been retained, with some structural work fitting around existing roads.</p>
<p>Following construction, although the area was more developed, the City Hospital was unchanged. In terms of access, there were two roundabouts on both sides of Hospital Road, which connected to the Ring Road and City Road. In terms of transport facilities, while a bus station had been built for people who come to this Hospital, all bus stops had been removed. Reaching the hospital had been made easier with the addition of a public car park on the east side of the hospital; the old car park was reserved for staff.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You gave a clear <strong>overall summary</strong>, identifying that most development happened in the south and east.</p></li>
<li><p>You <strong>covered all key features</strong>: roads, car parks, roundabouts, bus station, and removal of bus stops.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Some factual inaccuracies and unclear phrasing reduce precision:</p></li>
<li><p>❌ “north side was left retained” → grammatically incorrect; and factually unclear. There’s no major feature on the north side of the hospital that should be described as “retained.”</p>
<p>✅ Suggestion: “…while the hospital building itself remained unchanged.”</p></li>
<li><p>❌ “three main roads… had largely been retained…” → This sentence is confusing; you listed the roads as if they were new, then said they were retained. Also, the roads weren’t developed structurally—the development was around them.</p></li>
<li><p>The task required clear before/after comparisons. Your timeline control is a bit weak in parts. For example:</p>
<p>“Following construction, although the area was more developed, the City Hospital was unchanged.”</p>
<p>✅ Better: “After redevelopment, the hospital building itself remained unchanged, while the surrounding infrastructure was significantly upgraded.”</p></li>

<p>✅ Strengths:</p>
<p>Good use of sequencing phrases: “Prior to development,” “Following construction,” “In terms of…”</p>
<p>Logical paragraph structure with clear division: before vs.&nbsp;after.</p>
<p>🔧 Areas for Improvement:</p>
<p>Some cohesion devices are misused or overused:</p>
<p>Repetition of “In terms of…” — try synonyms like “Regarding,” “With respect to,” “Concerning,” etc.</p>
<p>Sentences sometimes lack clarity due to poor syntax:</p>

<p>✅ Strengths:</p>
<p>You use some appropriate map-related vocabulary: roundabouts, bus station, hospital road, car park, retained, facilities.</p>
<p>🔧 Issues:</p>
<p>Some inaccurate or awkward word choices:</p>
<p>“the area did not need to handle a crowd”</p>
<p>✅ Better: “the area had limited traffic demand before development”</p>
<p>“used for the public and the staff of the hospital” → too wordy</p>

<p>🔧 Issues:</p>
<p>Multiple tense control and grammar slips:</p>
<p>❌ “north side was left retained” → incorrect phrase (double passive). Should be:</p>
<p>✅ “the north side remained undeveloped” or “was left untouched”</p>
<p>❌ “come to this Hospital” → wrong register</p>
<p>✅ Use: “visit the hospital” (no capital H for “hospital” unless part of its name)</p>
<p>Use of past perfect (“had been built”) is not always necessary—present perfect or simple past may be better if it’s part of the map description.</p>

<p>The two maps show before and after road access was improved to serve the City Hospital. Overall, most development took place on the southern and eastern sides of the hospital, where a number of transport facilities had been built, while the hospital building itself remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Prior to development, the area had limited traffic demand. In terms of its transport facilities, there was a car park, which was on the east side of hospital road, used by both the public and hospital staff. Additionally, there were some bus stops on both sides of the hospital road.</p>
<p>After redevelopment, the hospital building itself remained unchanged, while the surrounding infrastructure was significantly upgraded. Regarding access, there were two roundabouts on both sides of Hospital Road, which connected to the Ring Road and City Road. Concerning access features, while a bus station had been built for hospital visitors, all bus stops had been removed. Access to the hospital was improved by the addition of a public car park on the east side of the hospital; the old car park was reserved for staff.</p>
<p>🔹 1. Task Achievement:</p>
<p>✅ What’s good:</p>
<p>You clearly identify changes between the two maps: bus station, car parks, roundabouts, etc.</p>
<p>You correctly state that the hospital building itself remained unchanged.</p>
<p>You use appropriate comparisons between before and after.</p>
<p>You included specific features with accurate location references (east side, both sides of Hospital Road, etc.)</p>
<p>🔧 To improve:</p>
<p>The phrase “developed as a city hospital connection” is a little unclear or awkward. Better phrased as:</p>
<p>✅ “…developed to improve road access to the City Hospital”</p>
<p>✅ OR: “…developed to enhance transportation infrastructure around City Hospital.”</p>
<p>🔹 2. Coherence and Cohesion:</p>
<p>✅ What’s good:</p>
<p>Paragraphs are well-organized: introduction, before, after.</p>
<p>Clear linking: “Prior to development,” “After redevelopment,” “Additionally,” “Regarding access,” “Concerning access features”.</p>
<p>🔧 Suggestions:</p>
<p>Try not to repeat phrases like “the hospital building itself remained unchanged.” You used this twice in two paragraphs. Rephrase or omit the second mention.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>After redevelopment, while the hospital remained the same, major upgrades were made to the surrounding transport infrastructure.</p>
<p>“Concerning access features” is a bit unnatural/formal. Instead, use:</p>
<p>✅ “In terms of transport facilities…”</p>
<p>✅ “With regard to public transport…”</p>
<p>🔹 3. Lexical Resource:</p>
<p>✅ Strengths:</p>
<p>Strong topic vocabulary: “transport facilities,” “infrastructure,” “redevelopment,” “hospital visitors,” “reserved for staff”</p>
<p>Accurate prepositions: “on the east side,” “connected to”</p>
<p>🔧 Suggestions:</p>
<p>Consider varying “access” a bit more to avoid repetition. You use “access” in multiple forms (road access, access features, reaching the hospital).</p>
<p>You can use:</p>
<p>“transport links”</p>
<p>“connection routes”</p>
<p>“entry to the hospital was improved…”</p>
<p>🔹 4. Grammatical Range and Accuracy:</p>
<p>✅ What’s good:</p>
<p>Good range of sentence structures: relative clauses, passive voice, present perfect/passive</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>*“…a bus station had been built for hospital visitors…” ✅ Excellent use of past perfect passive.</p>
<p>🔧 Errors to Fix:</p>
<p>❌ “…road access before and after it was developed as a city hospital connection.”</p>
<p>✅ Awkward and not idiomatic</p>
<p>✅ Better: “…before and after road access was improved to serve the City Hospital.”</p>
<p>❌ “…Reaching the hospital had been made easier…”</p>
<p>✅ Better: “Access to the hospital was improved by the addition of a public car park…”</p>

<section id="sample-band-8-model-for-comparison" class="level1" data-number="4">
<h1 data-number="4"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Sample Band 8 Model (for comparison)</h1>
<p>The two maps illustrate the road access to City Hospital before and after improvements made in 2007.</p>
<p>Overall, while the hospital building itself remained unchanged, major developments were made to the surrounding infrastructure, particularly to traffic flow, parking, and public transport facilities.</p>
<p>Before the changes, Hospital Road was directly accessible from City Road, with bus stops located on either side of Hospital Road. A single car park, situated to the east of the hospital, served both staff and public.</p>
<p>Following redevelopment, two roundabouts were added—one at the intersection of Hospital Road and City Road, and another where Hospital Road meets the Ring Road. These roundabouts improved traffic circulation. A new bus station was constructed on the west side of Hospital Road and is now accessible via the roundabouts. The original car park is now reserved for hospital staff, and a new public car park was built to the east, accessible via a new road off the ring road.</p>

<p>Write:</p>
<ul>
<li>Step 1: Noticing details</li>
<li>Step 2: Identifying key information</li>
<li>Step 3: Grouping information</li>
</ul>
<p>1</p>
<p>What: fish and meat consumption When: 1979 - 2004, 25-year period (step 5 year) Where: an European country How: grams per person / week (each week, ) Categories: 4 type: fish, lamb, beef, chicken</p>
<p>2 chicken: from below 150 (3) to about 250 (1) +++ overcome beef in 1989 overcome lamb right after 1979</p>
<p>beef: from abow 210 (1) to ~ 120 (2) — fluctuate periods 1982 - 1986, and 1994</p>
<p>lamb: from 150 (2) to ~ 60 (3) – 2 fluctuate time: ~ 1987 and 1998 pattern like beef</p>
<p>fish: above 50 (4) to below 50 (4) - relative stable decrease</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>p1: beef, lamb p2: chicken p3: fish</p>
<p>Write:</p>
<p>The line graph shows the consumption of fish and three types of meat by each person in a European country over a 25-year period from 1979 to 2004.</p>
<p>Overall, it is clear that the minority of food consumption came from fish throughout the period, and the general trend was to move away from beef and lamb as chicken became the dominant meat source of this category.</p>
<p>In the first decade, beef consumption was the highest in the food categories listed. Despite reaching a low of about 150 grams, it then recovered to reach a high of about 230 grams per week. However, after 1988, beef consumption fell almost continuously, and by 2004 had almost 120 grams. Lamb almost exactly mirrored the fluctuation pattern of beef. Falling from the second-highest number at 150 grams in 1979 to approximately 60 grams per week by the end of the period.</p>
<p>In contrast, chicken began the period at below 150 grams in 1979, to took the lead from around 1989 onwards. Especially, the rise in chicken corresponds to the decline of beef and lamb, and by 2002, it hit a peak of about 260 grams before slightly dropping to 250 grams in 2004.</p>
<p>Fish was consistently eaten the least, beginning at around 60 grams per week, then dropping to below 50 grams. While it was the lowest, it remained relatively stable for the majority of the period.</p>
<ul>
<li>improve phrasing like:</li>
</ul>
<p>“to took the lead from around 1989 onwards” -&gt; “and overtook the other meats and fish in consumption from around 1989”</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid vague or incorrect causal links:</li>
</ul>
<p>“especially, the rise in chicken corresponds …” -&gt; “Notably, the increase in chicken consumption coincided with a decline in both beef and lamb.”</p>
<p>-&gt;</p>
<p><em>Chicken consumption, which started below 150 grams per person per week in 1979, steadily increased and surpassed all other meats by 1989.</em></p>
<p><em>Meanwhile, fish remained the least consumed protein throughout the entire period, showing minimal fluctuation.</em></p>
<p>not: “minority of food consumption came from fish”</p>
<p>-&gt;: “Fish accounted for the smallest proportion of consumption.”</p>
<p>not: “hit a peak of about 260 grams”</p>
<p>-&gt; “peaked at approximately 260 grams per person per week.”</p>
<p><em>Lamb followed a similar declining trajectory to beef, although its figures were consistently lower.</em></p>
<p><em>Chicken consumption rose steadily, eventually surpassing all other meat types.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>❌ <em>“to took the lead…”</em> (tense and structure error)</p></li>
<li><p>❌ <em>“Falling from the second-highest number…”</em> → This is a sentence fragment.</p></li>
<li><p>❌ <em>“Especially, the rise in chicken corresponds…”</em> → Misuse of the adverb</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Fragments like: <em>“Falling from the second-highest number at 150 grams…”</em> must be restructured:</p>
<p>“<em>Lamb consumption, which started at 150 grams, fell steadily throughout the period.</em>”</p>
<p>Work on <strong>tense consistency</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Past simple or past perfect is preferred for trends over time.</li>
<li>e.g.&nbsp;“had fallen to”, “peaked at”</li>

<p>Rewrite:</p>
<p>The line graph shows the consumption of fish and three types of meat eaten by <font color="#c00000">each</font> person in a European country over a 25-year period between 1979 and 2004.</p>
<p>Overall, it is clear that fish accounted for the smallest <del>number of consumption</del> <font color="#ff0000">amount consumed</font> throughout the period, and the general trend was move away from beef and lamb as chicken became the dominant food in those categor<del>y</del><font color="#ff0000">ies</font>.</p>
<p>In the first decade, beef consumption was the highest in the food categories listed. Despite reaching a low at about 160 grams a week, it recovered to hit a high of about 230 grams. However, after 1988, beef consumption fell almost continuously, and by 2004 had almost 120 grams. Lamb followed a similar declining trajectory to beef, although its figures were consistently lower. Lamb consumption, which started at 150 grams, fell steadily throughout the period, before <del>decreased</del> <font color="#ff0000">decreasing</font> to around 60 grams in 2004.</p>
<p><del>On the contrary</del> <font color="#ff0000">By contrast</font>, chicken consumption climbed gradually from below 150 grams, and overtook the other meats and fish in consumption from around 1989. Notably, the increase in chicken consumption coincided with a decline in both beef and lamb, and by 2002, it peaked at just over 260 grams per person each week before slightly dropped to 250 grams in 2004.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, fish remained the least consumed protein throughout the entire period, showing minimal fluctuation. <del>It’s</del> <font color="#ff0000">Its</font> figure began the period at around 60 grams, then dropped to below 50 grams in 2004.</p>

<li><p>Some wording is <strong>unclear or imprecise</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>❌ <em>“fish accounted for the smallest number of consumption”</em><br>
✅ <em>“fish accounted for the smallest share of consumption”</em> or <em>“was the least consumed food type”</em></li>

<li><p>Small factual mistake: <em>“before decreased to approximately 60 grams in 2005”</em><br>
❌ “decreased” is grammatically incorrect here.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>‘On the contrary’ is misued, it’s used when <strong>reversing an earlier statement</strong>, not when introducing contrast.</p>
<ul>
<li>-&gt; use ‘In contrast’, or “By contrast,” instead</li>

<p>A few <strong>abrupt transitions</strong>, e.g., between beef and lamb could be smoothed with conjunctions:<br>

<p>Sample:</p>
<p>The line graph illustrates the weekly per-person consumption of fish and three types of meat in a European country between 1979 and 2004.</p>
<p><strong>Overall</strong>, while meat was consumed in significantly greater quantities than fish throughout the period, the general trend shows a decline in beef and lamb consumption and a sharp increase in chicken, which eventually became the most consumed meat.</p>
<p>In 1979, beef consumption was the highest, at over 200 grams per person per week. Although it dropped to around 160 grams early in the period, it recovered to a peak of 230 grams before experiencing a continuous decline after 1988, reaching just over 100 grams by 2004. Lamb followed a similar but less pronounced downward trend, falling steadily from 150 grams to approximately 60 grams.</p>
<p><strong>By contrast</strong>, chicken consumption began below 150 grams but rose steadily, overtaking both lamb and beef around 1989. It peaked at 260 grams per person in 2002 before slightly falling to 250 grams in the final year.</p>
<p>Fish consumption remained the lowest throughout the period, starting at around 60 grams and showing only a slight decline to just under 50 grams by 2004.</p>

<section id="overviewtrend-statements" class="level1" data-number="1">
<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Overview/Trend Statements</h1>
<p>In <strong>IELTS Academic Writing Task 1</strong>, the <strong>overview paragraph</strong> is a <strong>summary of the most noticeable features</strong> or <strong>overall trends</strong> in the visual data (chart, graph, table, map, process, etc.).</p>
<p>It usually comes after the introduction and should:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Highlight general patterns</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid specific data (no numbers!)</p></li>
<li><p>Use academic and formal language</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Focus on what stands out or changes clearly</p>
<p>Use umbrella terms for not too specific or detailed.</p>
<p>Do not include personal opinion, avoid using more extreme adjectives such as amazing, drastic, fascinating, remarkable, …. # Comparative Structures</p>
<p>Used to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Compare countries, categories, years, or items</p></li>
<li><p>Highlight differences or similarities between data points</p></li>
<li><p>Achieve a high score in Coherence &amp; Cohesion + Grammatical Range</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Comparative structures allow you to describe how one value is higher, lower, more, or less than another.</p>
<p>This is essential in IELTS Writing Task 1, where you must compare numerical data across:</p>
<p>Countries</p>
<p>Years</p>
<p>Age groups</p>
<p>Product categories</p>
<p>Sectors or industries</p>
<p>Using accurate and varied comparative grammar helps you score Band 7+ in both Task Achievement and Grammatical Range.</p>

<p>A <strong>relative clause</strong> (also called an <strong>adjective clause</strong>) gives <strong>extra information</strong> about a <strong>noun</strong> in the sentence. It starts with a <strong>relative pronoun</strong> such as:</p>
<ul>

<li><p><em>which</em> (for things or ideas)</p></li>
<li><p><em>that</em> (for people or things – less formal)</p></li>

<p>Overall, women were generally more physically active than men across most age groups, with the exception of those aged 15 to 24. While male participation increased with age, female activity levels remained relatively stable and consistently higher throughout adulthood. The gender gap was most pronounced in the 25 to 34 age group but narrowed again among those aged 65 and over.</p>
<p>In the youngest age category (15 to 24), a higher percentage of males (52.8%) participated in regular physical activity compared to females (47.7%). This was the only age group where men were more active than women, indicating a reversal of the general trend observed in the other age groups.</p>
<p>From age 25 onwards, female participation in physical activity consistently exceeded that of males. The most significant difference was seen in the 35 to 44 group, where only 39.5% of men exercised regularly compared to 52.5% of women - a gap of over 13 percentage points. As men grew older, their activity levels gradually increased, reaching 45.1% by the 55 to 64 group. However, they still lagged behind women, whose activity levels remained steady at around 52-53%.</p>
<p>Among those aged 65 and above, the gender gap in physical activity levels almost disappeared. Approximately 47.1% of women and 46.7% of men reported being physically active, making this the only age group where the figures for both genders were nearly equal.</p>

<p>The bar chart shows the percentage of men and women in Australia who did regular physical activity in 2010. The data is divided into six different age groups.</p>
<p>Overall, women were more active than men in most age groups, except for the youngest group. The biggest difference between genders can be seen in people aged 25 to 34, while the activity levels for older people were more similar.</p>
<p>In the 15 to 24 age group, men were slightly more active than women, with 52.8% of males doing regular physical activity compared to 47.7% of females. This was the only age group where men were more active than women, indicating a reversal of the general trend observed in the other age groups.</p>
<p>From age 25 onwards, female participation in physical activity consistent exceeded that of males. Among those aged 35 to 44,</p>
<p>In the oldest group, aged 65 and over, the figures were almost the same: 46.7% for men and 47.1% for women. This was the only age category where the gender gap almost disappeared.</p>

<p>The bar chart shows the proportion of Australian males and females across six age groups who engaged in regular activity in 2010.</p>
<p>Overall, women tended to be more physically active than men in most age groups, except among the youngest group, where males had a slightly higher participation rate. From age 25 onwards, female participation in physical activity consistently exceeded that of males.</p>
<p>Among 15 to 24-year-olds, approximately 52.8% of men were physically active, slightly more than the 47.7% of women in the same age range. This is the only age group in which male activity rates were higher than female rates.</p>
<p>From age 25 to 64, women were consistently more active than men. The most notable difference occurred in the 25 to 34 age group, where nearly half of the women (48.9%) were active compared to only 42.2% of men. This gender gap remained relatively steady in the following age brackets, with female activity rates hovering around 52%-53%, while male figures gradually increased from 39.5% (age 35-44) to 45.1% (age 55-64).</p>
<p>In the oldest age group (65 and over), the activity levels of men and women were nearly identical, with 46.7% of males and 47.1% of females participating in regular physical activity, showing minimal gender difference by this stage of life.</p>

<p>The line graph illustrates the average carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions per person in four European countries - the United Kingdom, Sweden, Italy, and Portugal - over a 40-year period from 1967 to 2007.</p>
</section>

<h2 data-number="1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Overview</h2>
<p>Overall, while the UK and Sweden experienced significant declines in per capita emissions, Italy and Portugal saw upward trends. By the end of the period, the emissions levels of all four countries became more closely aligned, despite their very different starting points.</p>
</section>
<section id="paragraph-1-uk-and-sweden" class="level2" data-number="1.3">
<h2 data-number="1.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="paragraph-1-uk-and-sweden"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Paragraph 1: UK and Sweden</h2>
<p>In 1967, the United Kingdom had by far the highest CO2 emissions, at approximately 11 metric tonnes per person. However, this figure steadily declined over the 40-year period, reaching just over 8 tonnes in 2007. Sweden followed a similar pattern: emissions rose slightly from 9 to a peak of about 10 tonnes in 1997, before dropping sharply to just over 5 tonnes by the end of the period.</p>
</section>
<section id="paragraph-2-italy-and-portugal" class="level2" data-number="1.4">
<h2 data-number="1.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="paragraph-2-italy-and-portugal"><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Paragraph 2: Italy and Portugal</h2>
<p>In contrast, both Italy and Portugal showed rising trends. Italy’s emissions increased gradually from about 4 tonnes in 1967 to around 7.5 tonnes in 2007, overtaking Sweden in the late 1980s. Portugal, which began with the lowest emissions at roughly 1 tonne per person, saw a consistent rise throughout the period, reaching levels similar to Sweden by 2007.</p>
<p>Conversely, both Italy and Portugal experienced upward trends in carbon emissions over the period. Italy’s figures rose steadily from approximately 4 metric tonnes in 1967 to nearly 7.5 tonnes by 2007, surpassing Sweden sometime in the late 1980s. Meanwhile, Portugal, which started with the lowest per capita emissions at around 1 tonne, recorded a continual increase and reached a level comparable to that of Sweden by the end of the timeframe.</p>

<p>Q11: Before Queen Elizabeth I visited the castle in 1576,</p>
<p>A. repairs were carried out to the quest rooms.</p>
<p>B. a new building was constructed for her.</p>
<p>C. a fire damaged part of the main hall.</p>
<p>transcript:</p>
<p><em>“…it was beginning to look a bit run down, and it was decided that rather than repair the guest rooms, they’d make a new house for her out of wood next to the main hall.”</em><br>
<em>“…She stayed there for four nights… unfortunately it was destroyed a few years later by fire.”</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The fire happened after her visit, not before</p></li>
<li><p>The option talks about <strong>timing</strong>, and IELTS tests this detail often.</p></li>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>“check with someone if you’re not sure what to do – your supervisor is approachable and won’t mind explaining things”</strong></p>

<p>You chose:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>E: enjoy new challenges</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sounds like good advice, but it&nbsp;<strong>wasn’t actually said</strong>.</p>
<p>Here’s the relevant part:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>“Most of you have very little or no experience… and the first week may be quite challenging…”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>She&nbsp;<strong>acknowledges</strong>&nbsp;that it may be challenging — but she&nbsp;<strong>never says</strong>&nbsp;“Enjoy it!” or “embrace challenges.” She actually says:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>“Don’t worry too much… check with someone…”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So she’s saying the first week may be hard, but she’s not giving the&nbsp;<strong>advice</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<em>enjoy</em>&nbsp;the challenge. So&nbsp;<strong>E is an interpretation</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>not actual advice</strong>. - Only choose answers that are&nbsp;<strong>directly supported by the exact wording</strong>&nbsp;in the audio.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Do&nbsp;<strong>not infer advice</strong>&nbsp;unless the speaker clearly gives it as advice.</p></li>
<li><p>Watch out for choices that are&nbsp;<strong>logically good</strong>&nbsp;but&nbsp;<strong>not actually said</strong>.</p></li>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Since holidays are possible&nbsp;<strong>after</strong>&nbsp;6 months, that feels like a&nbsp;<em>restriction</em>, not a full ban. So maybe it’s&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>?</p>

<p>Totally understandable —&nbsp;<strong>but here’s the key</strong>&nbsp;in IELTS logic:</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>“Company policy for apprentices”</strong></p>

<p>So, the phrase&nbsp;<strong>“Booking holidays”</strong>&nbsp;in this question is specifically asking about&nbsp;<strong>during the apprenticeship</strong>&nbsp;(i.e., the 6 months).</p>

<p>❌ No holidays are allowed&nbsp;<strong>at all</strong>&nbsp;during your apprenticeship.<br>

<p>That’s a&nbsp;<strong>ban during the apprenticeship</strong>&nbsp;— not a restriction, but a&nbsp;<strong>prohibition</strong>. Therefore:</p>

<p>At QUESTION 10. I feels TRUE because the word ‘related’ , i think i can choose TRUE.</p>
<p>When read the statement, I thought that: “Accommodation is&nbsp;<strong>related</strong>&nbsp;to 26% of satisfaction” → meaning it’s&nbsp;<strong>included</strong>&nbsp;in that 26%.</p>
<p>I saw the word <strong>related to</strong>, which seems close to <strong>account for</strong>, and I know <strong>accommodation is part of</strong> that 26%.</p>
<p>But the key logic problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>The statement claims: all 26% is related to accommodation.</li>
<li>The text says: transport AND accommodation together account for 26%.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, accommodation is related.</p>
<p>But not <strong>all of the 26%</strong> is related to accommodation.</p>

<p>If a statement <strong>overstates</strong> or <strong>exaggerates</strong> what’s in the text - even a little - the answer is <strong>FALSE</strong>, not TRUE</p>
<p>Trick:</p>
<p>When a stement <strong>splits combined data</strong> and <strong>assigns it all to just one element</strong>, it’s <strong>FALSE</strong>.</p>

<p>A recent study on international students found that&nbsp;<strong>70% of them were satisfied with the quality of teaching</strong>, while&nbsp;<strong>30% mentioned issues with accommodation and cost of living.</strong><br>
The report also highlighted that&nbsp;<strong>students prefer studying in cities with strong public transport systems</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>cultural diversity</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;70% of international students were satisfied with both teaching and accommodation.<br>
A. TRUE<br>
B. FALSE<br>
C. NOT GIVEN</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;Cost of living is a concern for 30% of international students.<br>
A. TRUE<br>
B. FALSE<br>
C. NOT GIVEN</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;Students tend to avoid cities without good public transport.<br>
A. TRUE<br>
B. FALSE<br>
C. NOT GIVEN</p>
<p>1B, just teaching 2B, in include accommodation 3C, i dont see that information (it is assuming of the sentence ..)</p>
<p><strong>Why:</strong>&nbsp;The passage says students&nbsp;<strong>“prefer cities with strong public transport”</strong>, but that&nbsp;<strong>doesn’t mean</strong>&nbsp;they&nbsp;<em>avoid</em>&nbsp;places without it. IELTS needs&nbsp;<strong>clear evidence</strong>, not assumptions. So this is&nbsp;<strong>NOT GIVEN</strong>.</p>

<p>At question 28</p>
<p>You read that people were “worried” about computer art and assumed this was because&nbsp;<strong>humans might become worse</strong>&nbsp;at art or creativity — a&nbsp;<em>decline in human ability</em>.</p>
<p>This is a&nbsp;<strong>reasonable guess</strong>, but IELTS doesn’t test guesses. You must match ideas&nbsp;<em>exactly</em>.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>“They are worried that it is taking something special away from what it means to be human.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That “<strong>something special</strong>” is clearly&nbsp;<strong>human creativity</strong>, which is described as a&nbsp;<strong>core human trait</strong>. So the concern isn’t about becoming&nbsp;<strong>worse</strong>&nbsp;at art; it’s about&nbsp;<strong>losing what makes us unique</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Option D</strong>&nbsp;implies a&nbsp;<strong>skill-level decline</strong>&nbsp;— like artists becoming lazy or less creative.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Option C</strong>&nbsp;talks about&nbsp;<strong>existential value</strong>&nbsp;— human creativity as a part of&nbsp;<em>our identity</em>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>At question 31</p>
<p>The chair paintings are an example of computer art which…</p>
<p>My Answer:</p>
<p><strong>D.</strong>&nbsp;highlights the technical limitations of the software</p>
<p>Correct Answer:</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong>&nbsp;achieves a particularly striking effect</p>
<p>You saw the phrase “<strong>technical glitch</strong>” and thought it showed a&nbsp;<strong>limitation</strong>, which is logical on the surface.</p>
<p>But…</p>

<p><em>“Some of the Painting Fool’s paintings of a chair came out in black and white, thanks to a technical glitch.&nbsp;<strong>This gives the work an eerie, ghostlike quality.</strong>”</em></p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="q1.-what-do-you-like-to-do-in-your-free-time">Q1. What do you like to do in your free time?</h4>
<p><em>In my spare time, I usually try to disconnect from digital distractions and engage in more meaningful activities, like journaling or reading. I’ve notice that when I’m bored, instead of resorting to overstimulation like social media, I try to embrace the boredom-it’s surprisingly stimulating and often sparks creative ideas.</em></p>

<section id="q2.-do-you-often-feel-bored" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="q2.-do-you-often-feel-bored">Q2. Do you often feel bored?</h4>
<p><em>Yes, I do from time to time. But I’ve learned that boredom, especially what psychologists call indifferent boredom, can be a gateway to creativity. Rather than seeing it as a negative state, I treat it as a signal that I need to re-engage with something mentally rewarding.</em></p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="q3.-what-kind-of-things-make-people-bored-easily-these-days">Q3. What kind of things make people bored easily these days ?</h4>
<p><em>Honestly, I think it’s our over-connected lifestyle. There’s so much passive consumption -videos, scrolling, noise - that it paradoxically leads to a lack of meaningful engagement. When activities feel purposeless or repetitive, people fall into a state of apathy of reactant boredom, which is quite destructive.</em></p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="q1.-what-subject-did-you-enjoy-most-at-school">Q1. What subject did you enjoy most at school?</h4>
<p><em>I really enjoyed <del>literature</del> mathematics because it allowed me to express my thoughts creatively. I found that when the class was engaging, I was less likely to feel bored or distracted. It’s like what researchers say-when we feel meaningfully involved, boredom is less likely to set in.</em></p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="q2.-what-kind-of-teacher-do-you-prefer">Q2. What kind of teacher do you prefer?</h4>
<p><em>I prefer teachers who can make the subject come alive. Someone who sparks curiosity and encourages active learning rather than passive memorization. I think the worst thing is when a class becomes repetitive-it leads to apathy and disengagement.</em></p>

<p><strong>Cue Card: Describe a creative activity you enjoy doing.</strong></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>You should say:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What the activity is</p></li>
<li><p>How you learned it</p></li>
<li><p>Why you enjoy it</p></li>
<li><p>And explain how it helps you express yourself</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>One creative activity I’ve come to enjoy deeply is writing short stories. I began doing it during university, especially during those quiet moments of indifferent boredom when I felt mentally under-stimulated. Strangely, boredom sparked my imagination, letting my mind wander freely. I believe creativity often flourishes in those conditions. Writing allows me to explore ideas and emotions I can’t always express verbally. Sometimes I think of it like programming imagination into words, similar to how artificial intelligence tools like the Painting Fool are programmed to generate art. But unlike machines, my creativity stems from real emotional experiences. That personal input makes it fulfilling and cathartic.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cue Card: Describe an educational experience that was especially important for you.</strong></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>You should say:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What it was</p></li>
<li><p>When it happened</p></li>
<li><p>What you learned from it</p></li>
<li><p>And explain why it was important to you</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>One of the most memorable educational experiences I’ve had was attending a creativity workshop during high school. It was organized to help students break away from rigid academic routines and think outside the box. We weren’t given clear instructions- instead, we had to solve a real-world problem in teams. Initially, some of us felt a bit of ‘calibrating boredom’, unsure of what to do, but that actually pushed us to explore ideas more creatively. That session taught me that boredom isn’t necessarily negative- it can push us to innovate when we’re given freedom.</em></p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="q1.-do-you-think-computers-can-be-truly-creative">Q1. Do you think computers can be truly creative?</h4>
<p><em>It’s a fascinating question. Computers can simulate creativity through algorithms, like the Painting Fool or EMI composer program. But in my opinion, what they produce still lacks emotional depth. As one researcher put it, computer-generated art often lacks an irresistible essence because we know it wasn’t born out of genuine human experience or emotion.</em></p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="q2.-why-do-some-people-dislike-art-made-by-machines">Q2. Why do some people dislike art made by machines?</h4>
<p><em>I think it’s partly due to prejudice and partly because people value the effort and thought behind a piece. Studies show that when people think a human created the art, they perceive it as more meaningful. When the same art is labeled as machine-generated, the emotional connection is undermined.</em></p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="q3.-how-important-is-creativity-in-education-and-work">Q3. How important is creativity in education and work?</h4>
<p><em>Extremely important. In education, fostering creativity helps students move beyond memorization and into real problem-solving. In the workplace, creative thinking leads to innovation. Ironically, even as machines become more advanced, it’s our human creativity they still can’t supersede. That remains our most valuable trait.</em></p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="q1.-do-schools-do-enough-to-encourage-creativity">Q1. Do schools do enough to encourage creativity?</h4>
<p><em>In many cases, no. Education systems still prioritize exam results and memorization. While that ensures standardization, it often neglects skills like problem-solving and imagination. To truly foster creativity, schools need to incorporate more open-ended tasks and allow room for failure.</em></p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="q2.-how-can-teachers-keep-students-motivated-in-class">Q2. How can teachers keep students motivated in class?</h4>
<p><em>Teachers can make learning more engaging by connecting topics to real-life applications. Also, varying teaching methods-such as using visuals, stories, or group activities- can help. Most importantly, they should encourage questions and curiosity rather than just delivering information.</em></p>

<p><em>Not necessarily. Some psychologists argue that indifferent boredom or low-stimulation moments can actually trigger imagination. If managed correctly, it can lead to new ideas. However, constant boredom caused by uninspiring lessons is definitely counterproductive.</em></p>

<section id="independent-clause-subordinate-clause" class="level1" data-number="1">
<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Independent Clause &amp; Subordinate Clause</h1>
<p>A <strong>clause</strong> í a word group that contains a subject and a verb. If that clause can stand alone-in other words, if that clause is the same as a sentence-we call it an <strong><em>independent clause</em></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>independent clause</strong>: She <strong>held</strong> the scale</p>
<p><strong>subordinate clause</strong>: as she <strong>held</strong> the scale</p>

<div class="callout-title-container flex-fill">
Note
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>When we say that a clause is <em>subordinate</em>, we are not referring to its importance, but simply to its grammatical dependence on the independent clause.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>A complex sentence is a <em>sentence that contains at least one subordinate clause</em>.</p>
<p>Subordinate clauses can be divided into three categories based on their function: - adjective clauses - adverb clauses - noun clauses</p>
<p>Example: - Independent clause/sentence: <em>They</em> <strong>got</strong> into a station wagon. (has a subject and verb and can stand alone). - Subordinate clause/adverb: As <em>they</em> <strong>got</strong> into a station wagon. (has a subject and verb but cannot stand alone). - subordinate clause/adjective: <em>Which</em> <strong>was</strong> a station wagon. (has a subject and verb but cannot stand alone) - subordinate clause/noun: That <em>they</em> <strong>got</strong> into a station wagon.</p>
<p>Example: 1. A single sword is held aloft. (independent) 2. After you left me. (subordinate) 3. Because my uncle sat at the stone table. (subordinate) 4. That a serpentine hair bangs over one ear. (subordinate) 5. Which is a hidden pleasure. (subordinate) 6. Who knew the rules and punishments. (subordinate) 7. Why she chose to wear the hex on her forehead. (subordinate) 8. You lose yourself in the cave of endless breath. (independent)</p>
</section>
<section id="subordinating-conjunctions" class="level1" data-number="2">
<h1 data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Subordinating Conjunctions</h1>
<p>An <strong>adverbial subordinate clause</strong> begins with a <strong>subordinating conjunction</strong>. That list: - after, as if, as long as, as soon as, although, as, as if, because, before, even if, if, since, so that, though, till, unless, when, whenever, wherever, while.</p>
<p>Let’s take a complete sentence, add a word to that complete sentence, and get less than a complete sentence.</p>
<ul>
<li>start with a complete sentence: <em>the sunset behind Lake Tahoe is spectacular</em></li>
<li>add a word: <em>although</em></li>
<li>get less than a complete sentence: <em>although the sunset behind lake Tahoe is spectacular</em></li>
</ul>
<p>This is how adverb clauses are created.</p>
<ul>
<li>a subordinating conjunction + a sentence = an adverb clause</li>
<li><em>although</em> + <em>the sunset behind Lake Tahoe is spectacular</em> = an adverb clause</li>
</ul>

<p>❌ Confusing sentence structure: The second sentence is overly long and hard to follow.</p>
<p>❌ Linking devices are basic or missing: Use clearer transitions like “This figure fell further in the following years…” or “However, a minor rise was seen in 2012…”</p>
<p>✅ Attempts paragraphing and sequencing — but needs clearer flow.</p>
</section>
<section id="lexical-resource-band-6" class="level3" data-number="0.0.2">
<h3 data-number="0.0.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lexical-resource-band-6"><span class="header-section-number">0.0.2</span> Lexical Resource (Band 6)</h3>
<p>✅ Good use of terms like “steadily,” “considerably,” “slight decrease,” “mild climb.”</p>
<p>❌ Repetition of words like “dropped” and “decreased” — try synonyms: declined, fell, dipped, reduced, diminished.</p>
<p>❌ “Of new house built” → should be “in the number of new houses built.”</p>

<p>❌ “450 000 and about 450 000 in 2006 to 450000 and 200000 in 2008, respectively with the south and the west” → very awkward and grammatically confusing.</p>
<p>❌ Misuse of “respectively with” → it should be: “…450,000 and 200,000 in 2008, for the south and the west, respectively.”</p>
<p>❌ “300000 and 150 000 of new house built” → ❌ incorrect structure. Should be:</p>

<section id="rewritten-version-band-7.5-8-model" class="level1" data-number="1">
<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Rewritten Version (Band 7.5-8 model)</h1>
<p>The number of new residential constructions in the South and the West dropped steadily between 2006 and 2012. In 2006, approximately 900,000 new houses were built in the South, while the West recorded about 450,000. These figures fell significantly by 2008, reaching 450,000 and 200,000 respectively. Between 2008 and 2010, the decline continued, though more gradually, with the numbers dropping to 300,000 in the South and 150,000 in the West. However, by 2012, there was a slight increase, with around 310,00 homes constructed in the South and 160,000 in the West.</p>
</section>
<section id="higher-band-version" class="level1" data-number="2">
<h1 data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Higher band version</h1>
<p>Between 2006 and 2012, the number of new residential constructions in both the South and the West declined overall, though with minor fluctuations. In 2006, the South recorded approximately 900,000 new homes, while the West saw about half that figure at 450,000. By 2008, these numbers had dropped significantly to 450,000 in the South and 200,000 in the West. The downward trend continued more gradually over the next two years, reaching 300,000 and 150,00 respectively by 2010. However, 2012 saw a slight recovery, with new constructions rising modestly to around 310,000 in the South and 160,000 in the West.</p>

<p>The number of visitors to Dover increases overall throughout the year. In Spring, Dover recorded approximately 5,000 tourists. The Summer experiences a sharp climb to two times the figure of the before season. The upward trend continues more gradually over the next two seasons, reaching 15,000 in Autumn before having a peak at 25,000 in Winter.</p>
<section id="coherence-cohesion-band-5.56-1" class="level3" data-number="2.0.1">
<h3 data-number="2.0.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="coherence-cohesion-band-5.56-1"><span class="header-section-number">2.0.1</span> Coherence &amp; Cohesion (Band 5.5–6)</h3>
<p>✅ You attempt a logical sequence: Spring → Summer → Autumn → Winter.</p>
<p>❌ However, some sentence transitions are unnatural or slightly unclear.</p>
<p>❌ Use of linking phrases like “before having a peak” is awkward and unidiomatic.</p>
</section>
<section id="lexical-resource-band-6-1" class="level3" data-number="2.0.2">
<h3 data-number="2.0.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lexical-resource-band-6-1"><span class="header-section-number">2.0.2</span> Lexical Resource (Band 6)</h3>
<p>✅ Good attempt with words like “sharp climb,” “upward trend”</p>
<p>❌ “two times the figure of the before season” → awkward and incorrect. Better:</p>
<p>✅ “twice the number recorded in the previous season.”</p>
<p>❌ “experiences a sharp climb” → Summer can’t “experience” something.</p>
<p>✅ Use: “There was a sharp rise in summer…” or “The number increased sharply in summer.”</p>
</section>
<section id="grammatical-range-accuracy-band-55.5" class="level3" data-number="2.0.3">
<h3 data-number="2.0.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="grammatical-range-accuracy-band-55.5"><span class="header-section-number">2.0.3</span> Grammatical Range &amp; Accuracy (Band 5–5.5)</h3>
<p>❌ “The Summer experiences” → incorrect article usage. Should be:</p>
<p>✅ “In summer, the number rose sharply…”</p>
<p>❌ “before having a peak” → ungrammatical. Try:</p>
<p>✅ “before peaking at 25,000 in winter.”</p>
<p>✅ You attempted complex structures, but several were awkward or incorrect.</p>
<p>Sample:</p>
<p>The number of visitors to Dover increased overall throughout the year. In Spring, the town welcomed approximately 5,000 tourists. This figure doubled in summer, rising sharply to 10,000. The upward trend continued at a more moderate pace, reaching 15,000 in autumn, before peaking at 25,000 in winter.</p>
<hr>
<p>Engineering was the dominant choice for male students, comprising 45% of their total enrollment, more than twice the proportion of females in the same field (20%). In contrast, only 10% of men choose Humanities, while this subject attracted 30% of women, three times higher. Similarly, Education accounted for 35% of female enrollment, compared to just 20% of men.</p>
<p>🔍 Detailed Analysis</p>
<p>🟦 1. Task Achievement (Band 7–8)</p>
<p>✅ You cover key features and specific numbers.</p>
<p>✅ You make comparisons between male and female enrollment.</p>
<p>❌ Minor inconsistency in the final sentence — it’s Education that had 35% of women and 20% of men, which you got right, but the word “just” is too informal here.</p>
<p>🟨 2. Coherence &amp; Cohesion (Band 7)</p>
<p>✅ Clear overall structure and logical flow: from Engineering → Humanities → Education.</p>
<p>❌ “three times higher” is vague. It’s better to say: “three times the proportion” or “threefold that of men.”</p>
<p>❌ Avoid “similarly” unless the comparison is parallel — Education and Humanities are different in structure.</p>
<p>🟥 3. Lexical Resource (Band 7)</p>
<p>✅ Good use of: comprising, proportion, attracted, accounted for.</p>
<p>❌ Could vary with more formal phrases like:</p>
<p>“enrolled in” instead of “choose”</p>
<p>“constituted” instead of “accounted for”</p>
<p>🟩 4. Grammatical Range &amp; Accuracy (Band 7)</p>
<p>✅ Mostly correct grammar and comparatives.</p>
<p>❌ “Choose” → should be past tense: chose (as you’re describing a chart, not a general truth)</p>
<p>❌ Minor article omission: “more than twice the proportion…”</p>
<p>Rewrite: Engineering was the most popular subject among male students, accounting for 45% of their total enrollment, which was more than twice the proportion of females in the same field (20%). In contrast, only 10% of men chose Humanities, compared to 30% of women - three times the male figure. Likewise, Education attracted 35% of female students, while just 20% of male students enrolled in this subject.</p>

  <title>Type of sentences</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>In <strong>IELTS Writing Task 1 (Academic)</strong>, using a <strong>range of sentence types</strong> is crucial for achieving a <strong>Band 7 or higher</strong> in <strong>Grammatical Range and Accuracy</strong>.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of <strong>sentence types you should use</strong>, with <strong>examples</strong> tailored to data description:</p>
<section id="kinds-of-sentences-according-to-structure" class="level1" data-number="1">
<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Kinds of sentences according to structure</h1>
<section id="simple-sentences" class="level2" data-number="1.1">
<h2 data-number="1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="simple-sentences"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Simple Sentences</h2>
<p>Used to state clear facts. Simple Sentences have one subject and one finite verb.</p>
<ul>
<li>Structure: Subject + verb + object</li>
<li>Example:
<ul>
<li>Internet access rose in all income groups.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="compound-sentences" class="level2" data-number="1.2">
<h2 data-number="1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="compound-sentences"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Compound Sentences</h2>
<p>Connect two related ideas using coordinating conjunctions (and, but, or, so, yet). When two independent clauses are joined by <strong>for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so</strong> (FANBOYS), we <strong>must use a comma</strong> before the conjunction. Those clauses can be connected by a semicolon (;)</p>
<ul>
<li>Structure: Independent clause + conjunction + independent clause.</li>
<li>Example:
<ul>
<li>She told a folk tale, <strong>and</strong> we all listened to her.</li>
<li>He does not speak our language, yet see seems to understand what we say.</li>
<li>Low-income households saw growth, but they remained behind other groups.</li>
<li>We moved to Florida in 1978; we stayed only five years <strong>and</strong> then returned to Ohio.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Compound sentences can be reduced by removing the subject and verb in the second clause if they are the same as in the first clause.</p>
<ul>
<li>We ask him now or (we) wait until tomorrow.</li>
<li>He is sitting and (he is) listening to me.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="complex-sentences" class="level2" data-number="1.3">
<h2 data-number="1.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="complex-sentences"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Complex Sentences</h2>
<p>Used to show relationships such as cause, contrast, or time. A complex sentence is made up of: - One independent clause (main clause) - One or more dependent clauses (subordinate clauses)</p>
<p>The main clause can stand alone as a complete sentence.</p>
<p>The subordinate clause cannot stand alone-it depends on the main clause to complete its meaning.</p>
<p>Structure:</p>
<p>[Main Clause] + [Subordinate Clause]</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>[Subordinate Clause], [Main Clause]</p>
<ul>
<li>Examples:
<ul>
<li>Because she was tired, she went to bed early.
<ul>
<li>“she went to bed early” = main clause</li>
<li>“Because she was tired” = subordinate clause (reason)</li>
</ul></li>

  <title>University Enrollment</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><em>The pie charts below show enrollment in different fields of study at a particular university.</em></p>
<p><em>Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.</em> <img src="https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/uni-enroll/Pasted image 20250625100948.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The two pie charts illustrate the percentage of male and female students enrolled in four academic fields - Social Sciences, Humanities, Education, and Engineering - at Clydesdale University. Overall, male students showed a strong preference for Engineering, while female students were more inclined toward Humanities and education. Social science was the only field with relatively balanced participation between genders.</p>
<p>Engineering was the dominant choices for male students, comprising 45% of their total enrollment, more than twice the proportion of females in the same field (20%). In constrast, only 10% of men chose Humanities, while this subject attracted 30% of women - three times higher. Similarly, Education accounted for 35% of female enrollment, compared to just 20% for men.</p>
<p>The only discipline where the gender gap was moderate was Social Sciences. While a quarter of men were enrolled in this field, women followed closely behind at 15%. Although a difference exists, this subject showed the least contrast in gender representation.</p>

<p>Q17 – “…when they don’t think they’re making enough progress…give up hope…stop believing…” - these phrases are all about <strong>losing confidence or motivation</strong>. - Correct answer: B - loss of confidence Q18 – “…takes a lot of determination and hard work…lots of people don’t have that kind of commitment.” - this is about the <strong>effort and long-term dedication</strong> needed. - Correct answer C - too much effort required. 💡 Why You Missed It:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You swapped the ideas: You took “hard work” and applied it to Q17, but that part comes second.</p></li>
<li><p>In IELTS MCQs, the order of the ideas usually matches the order of the questions.</p></li>
<li><p>You may have guessed based on vocabulary, not on exact function and meaning.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Loss of confidence - lose hope too much effort required - too hard to continue feeling less successful than others - comparing yourself to another</p>

<section id="do-you-often-use-public-transport" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="do-you-often-use-public-transport">Do you often use public transport</h4>
<p>Not really. I usually go by bike because it’s quicker and more convenient for me. I’m lucky - my office isn’t far from where I live, so I hardly ever need to use buses or trains. But when I do, I’d say the transport links in my area are decent.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="do-you-enjoy-shopping-in-your-local-area">Do you enjoy shopping in your local area?</h4>
<p>Yes, I do! There’s a brand new shopping mall that opened just a couple of months ago. It’s not too expensive either, so I can usually find something reasonable. I’ve definitely been going there more often lately.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-often-do-you-travel-for-work-or-study" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-often-do-you-travel-for-work-or-study">How often do you travel for work or study?</h4>
<p>These days, I only need to go into the city one or two days a week. Most of the time I work from home. I really appreciate that flexibility - it saves me time and money.</p>
</section>
<section id="do-you-like-your-neighborhood" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="do-you-like-your-neighborhood">Do you like your neighborhood?</h4>
<p>Yes, I really like it. It’s a quite area with good transport links and a lovely park nearby. The school here is one of the best in the country, and we also have a great hospital. I’ve been living here for a few years, and I’ve never had any problems.</p>
</section>
<section id="do-you-like-going-to-the-cinema" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="do-you-like-going-to-the-cinema">Do you like going to the cinema?</h4>
<p>Absolutely. There’s a brand new cinema in the city center - it’s only bene open a couple of months. I’ll definitely have a look this weekend. A friend told me it’s really modern and comfortable.</p>
</section>
<section id="do-you-often-meet-friends-in-your-free-time" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="do-you-often-meet-friends-in-your-free-time">Do you often meet friends in your free time?</h4>
<p>I try to. If they’re free after work, I could meet them for dinner or coffee. Thursday is usually better for me because I finish early. Really appreciate any time I get to catch up with them.</p>

<section id="describe-a-place-in-your-local-area-that-you-like-to-visit." class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="describe-a-place-in-your-local-area-that-you-like-to-visit.">Describe a place in your local area that you like to visit.</h4>
<p>You should say: - what the place is - where it is located - how often you go there - and explain why you enjoy going there</p>
<p>One place I enjoy visiting in my local area is a small park in the suburb where I live. It’s not a huge park, but it’s peaceful and well-kept, and I’ve been going there for years. The park is just a 10-minutes walk from my home, and it’s next to a lovely little cafe. You can’t miss it - it’s right opposite the new cinema that’s only been open a couple of months. I usually go there after work, maybe one or two days a week, just to unwind.</p>
<p>What I love most is how quiet it is. There’s hardly any traffic around, and it’s never crowded. I go by bike, which is really convenient, and it’s a great way to get a bit of exercise. Sometimes I take a book and it on a bench, or just enjoy walking around.</p>
<p>I think it’s only the best things about my neighborhood. It’s not too expensive to live here, the transport links are good, and places like this park make it even better. I really appreciate having a relaxing spot so close to home.</p>
</section>
<section id="do-you-think-its-important-to-have-public-places-in-cities" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="do-you-think-its-important-to-have-public-places-in-cities">Do you think it’s important to have public places in cities?</h4>
<p>Absolutely. I think public places like parks or community centers are essential in cities. They offer people space to relax and socialize, especially in areas where most people live in apartments. For example, the park near my house isn’t too expensive to maintain, but it really adds value to the neighborhood. I’ve been going there for years, and it’s always full of life - families, joggers, even students reading under the trees.</p>

<section id="why-do-people-prefer-to-go-to-parks-rather-than-shopping-centers" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-do-people-prefer-to-go-to-parks-rather-than-shopping-centers">Why do people prefer to go to parks rather than shopping centers?</h4>
<p>I think it depends on what they’re looking for. Parks are quiet and peaceful, and they’re usually free, while shopping centers can be noisy and crowded. A lot of people are put off by the idea of spending money every time they go out, so they prefer to visit a park instead. Personally, I go by bike to my local park - it’s great exercise and doesn’t cost a thing. You should be able to enjoy your free time without spending a lot.</p>

<section id="what-are-the-benefits-of-having-local-amenities-close-to-home" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-are-the-benefits-of-having-local-amenities-close-to-home">What are the benefits of having local amenities close to home?</h4>
<p>There are so many benefits. First, it saves time. If there’s a good school or a hospital nearby, that’s one less thing to worry about. For instance, in my area, we have one of the best hospitals in the country, and I really appreciate having it so close. There’s also a brand new cinema that’s only been open for a couple of months. It’s nice to have everything within walking distance - you can definitely tell that people feel more connected to their community.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-has-the-use-of-public-spaces-changed-in-recent-years">How has the use of public spaces changed in recent years?</h4>
<p>I think people are using public spaces more now, especially after the pandemic. There’s more focus on outdoor activities, mental health, and work-life balance. A lot of people work from home one or two days a week now, so they have more time to enjoy places like parks or cafes. It’s also become more common for local councils to invest in public areas because they’ve realized how much people value them.</p>

<section id="do-you-do-any-physical-exercise" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="do-you-do-any-physical-exercise">Do you do any physical exercise ?</h4>
<p>Yes, I try to stay active. I used to go to the gym, but honestly, fitting a visit into my busy day was a bit difficult. These days, I prefer cycling in the park. It’s fun, and being out in the fresh air really helps me relax. I also enjoy in because it keeps me fit without feeling like a chore.</p>
</section>
<section id="do-you-prefer-indoor-or-outdoor-activities" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="do-you-prefer-indoor-or-outdoor-activities">Do you prefer indoor or outdoor activities?</h4>
<p>I definitely prefer outdoor activities. I find going for a run or a bike ride much more enjoyable than being stuck in a gym. The fresh air and scenery make it feel less like exercise. But I”ll admit - if the weather’s bad, I skip it. Only real fanatics go out in the wind and rain!</p>
</section>
<section id="what-do-you-think-about-personal-trainers" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-do-you-think-about-personal-trainers">What do you think about personal trainers?</h4>
<p>I think they can be really helpful, especially for beginners. Having someone there to encourage you can help you achieve your goals can really boost motivation. The only downside is the cost - personal trainers can be expensive, and not everyone can afford that.</p>
</section>
<section id="describe-a-physical-activity-you-enjoy." class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="describe-a-physical-activity-you-enjoy.">Describe a physical activity you enjoy.</h4>
<p>*You should say:</p>
<p>what the activity is</p>
<p>where and when you do it</p>
<p>who you do it with</p>
<p>and explain why you enjoy it.*</p>
<p>One physical activity I really enjoy is swimming. I usually go to an indoor pool near my house, which means I can swim any time of year regardless of the weather. I often go after work, and sometimes my friend joins me.</p>
<p>What I like most about swimming is that it’s great for building fitness, but it’s also quite gentle on the body. It works all the muscles without putting too much strain on the joints. That said, it can be a bit solitary - you can’t exactly have a chat while swimming laps!</p>
<p>Still, I find it really relaxing and satisfying. It clears my mind and keeps me in shape. I’ve also set some small goals for myself, like increasing how many laps I can do, which helps me stay motivated.</p>

<section id="why-do-some-people-enjoy-physical-exercise-more-than-others" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-do-some-people-enjoy-physical-exercise-more-than-others">Why do some people enjoy physical exercise more than others?</h4>
<p>I think it depends on their personality and past experience. Some people enjoy exercise because they’ve built a habit and can see the progress they’re making, which keeps them motivated. Others might find it hard because they don’t feel any improvement at first, so they lost interest and give up. Also, if someone isn’t very flexible or physically confident, even simple exercises like yoga can feel surprisingly challenging.</p>

<section id="do-you-think-people-today-get-enough-physical-activity" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="do-you-think-people-today-get-enough-physical-activity">Do you think people today get enough physical activity?</h4>
<p>Honestly, I don’t think most people do. Many lead very busy lives, and fitting a workout into their schedule can be tough. Even if they join a gym, they often stop going after a few weeks. It takes a lot of determination and commitment to keep exercising regularly, especially if you’re not seeing immediate results.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-can-people-do-to-stay-motivated-to-exercise-regularly">What can people do to stay motivated to exercise regularly?</h4>
<p>One effective way is to set manageable goals. If people aim too high at the beginning, they might feel overwhelmed and give up. Having flexible targets, rewarding yourself when you reach a goal, or even exercising with a friend can make it more enjoyable and sustainable. Getting a personal trainer can also help, but that comes with a significant cost.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="is-it-better-to-do-exercise-indoors-or-outdoors">Is it better to do exercise indoors or outdoors?</h4>
<p>It depends on personal preference. Some people enjoy running or cycling outdoors because it gives them a sense of freedom and they get to enjoy the fresh air. Others prefer the gym or indoor pools where the environment is controlled, especially during bad weather. Personally, I find outdoor exercise more refreshing, as long as the conditions are right - I’m definitely not a fan of running in the rain.</p>

<section id="do-you-enjoy-working-on-creative-projects" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="do-you-enjoy-working-on-creative-projects">Do you enjoy working on creative projects ?</h4>
<p>Yes, I’ve always been interested in creative things, especially anything to do with colour. A while ago, I did a project where I experimented with natural dyes to colour fabrics like cotton and wool. It was quite hands-on - a real practical investigation - and even thought i was time-consuming, I found it fascinating.</p>
</section>
<section id="have-you-ever-made-something-by-hand" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="have-you-ever-made-something-by-hand">Have you ever made something by hand?</h4>
<p>Actually, yes. I once made some natural dyes myself as part of a textile design project. I thought it would just be a matter of using a teaspoon or so, but I ended up needing a whole pile of beetroot just to get a bit of colour. It took longer than I expected, but i was worth it.</p>
</section>
<section id="do-you-enjoy-doing-experiments" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="do-you-enjoy-doing-experiments">Do you enjoy doing experiments?</h4>
<p>I do, especially when there’s a creative element involved. I remember doing an experiment with different types of fabric - like cotton, wool, and nylon - to see how they reacted to natural and artificial dyes. I’d been going to test just one fibre at first, but then I decided to include more for comparison.</p>
</section>
<section id="do-you-often-try-new-things" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="do-you-often-try-new-things">Do you often try new things?</h4>
<p>Yes, I like following up on things that catch my interest. For example, I once visited an exhibition and saw a display of colorful textiles, which inspired me to research natural dyes. I even found a great book about a botanic garden that specialises in dye-producing plants.</p>

<section id="are-you-interested-in-art-of-design" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="are-you-interested-in-art-of-design">Are you interested in art of design?</h4>
<p>Definitely. I love anything visual. I once studied a dye called Tyrian purple, which was worn in ancient times by royalty because it was so rare. I didn’t use it in my project, though - it would’ve cost a fortune.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="describe-a-project-or-piece-of-work-you-did-either-at-school-or-at-home.">Describe a project or piece of work you did, either at school or at home.</h4>
<p>You should say: - what the project was</p>
<ul>
<li><p>why you did it</p></li>
<li><p>how you did it</p></li>
<li><p>and explain how you felt about doing it</p></li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most interesting projects I’ve ever done was a textile design assignment during my final year at university. I’ve always been interested in colour and design, so I chose to focus on how natural dyes could be used to color fabrics like cotton and wool. The idea actually came from a carpet shop I visited years ago when I was on holiday with my family in Turkey. I still remember all the amazing colours, and it really stuck with me. Later, I visited exhibition at a museum, and that gave me even more ideas. I decided to follow it up for my project. The project included a practical investigation, which meant I had to prepare and test various dyes on different types of fabric - cotton, wool, and nylon. At first, I was going to use just one fibre, but I changed my mind so I could make some comparisons. I used both ready-made dyes and homemade ones. For example, I tried using beetroot, but it was more difficult than I thought. I had to chop up a whole pile of it just to get a little bit of dye, and even then, the colour wasn’t as strong as I’d hoped. It ended up being a kind of watery cream shade on the wool, which was disappointing. Despite the challenges, I really enjoyed doing the project. It was creative, and I learned a lot - not just about fabrics, but also about how to plan and carry out an investigation. It took longer than I expected, but I felt proud of the final results.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="do-you-think-students-learn-more-from-doing-projects-or-from-traditional-classes">Do you think students learn more from doing projects or from traditional classes?</h4>
<p>I believe students often learn more from doing hands-on projects. When they’re actively involved in a practical investigation, like testing variables or creating something from scratch, they tend to remember the experience better. For example, when I made my own natural dyes for a design project, I ended up learning much more than I would have by just reading about the process in a textbook. It encourages creativity and independent thinking.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-kind-of-projects-are-most-beneficial-for-young-people">What kind of projects are most beneficial for young people ?</h4>
<p>I think the most useful projects are the ones that combine creativity and real-world skills. For instance, projects that involve planning, researching, or experimenting with different materials can teach valuable problem-solving skills. If young people can follow up on something they’re genuinely interested in-whether it’s science, design, or business - they’re more likely to stay motivated and take ownership of their learning.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="should-schools-focus-more-on-academic-subjects-or-creative-activities">Should schools focus more on academic subjects or creative activities?</h4>
<p>Ideally, there should be a balance. Academic subjects are important, of course, but creative activities help students develop other types of intelligence- like emotional awareness, visual thinking, or innovation. In my opinion, creative projects like art, music, or even textile design allow students to express themselves and discover talents they might not explore in regular academic classes.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-challenges-do-people-face-when-working-on-creative-projects">What challenges do people face when working on creative projects?</h4>
<p>One big challenge is time. Creative projects often take longer than expected. I remember thinking that dyeing fabric with natural ingredients would be simple, but I ended up needing a whole pile of beetroot just to get a weak color. Another issue is uncertainty-you don’t always know what the outcome will be. That can be discouraging if things don’t go as planned, especially if the materials cost a fortune.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-do-some-people-give-up-on-creative-hobbies-or-projects">Why do some people give up on creative hobbies or projects?</h4>
<p>Many people stop because they don’t see quick results. It takes a lot of commitment and patience to stick with something that doesn’t turn out perfectly the first time. Some might also abandon their projects if they lack proper guidance. For instance, without a good mentor or tutor, it’s easy to feel lost. Also, creative work can be expensive-materials, tools, or even time investment can be hard to maintain. ## Recording 4</p>

<p>(Using muse as a noun) Yes, I write in a journal regularly. It’s mostly filled with personal thoughts and random <strong>musings</strong> about life, people I meet, or even things I read. I find it helps me process my emotions and clears my mind.</p>

<p>In today’s busy world, people rarely have the time to <strong>muse on</strong> their own experiences, which may reduce self-awareness and emotional clarity.</p>

<section id="do-people-today-spend-enough-time-thinking-deeply" class="level3" data-number="4.1.5">

<p>Honestly, I don’t think so. Life today is fast-paced, and people are often distracted by social media or constant notifications. Deep thinking requires space and silence, and most people rarely take time to just sit and <strong>muse about</strong> important questions or life decisions. I think that kind of reflection is crucial for personal growth.</p>

<p>I think it’s partly because writing helps people process their thoughts. For many, a journal is a private place to record their <strong>musings</strong> about daily life or future goals. It’s also a way to make sense of emotions. Even blogs, which are more public, often start from personal reflection.</p>

<p>Definitely. While academic skills are essential, creativity allows students to explore ideas in original ways. Some of the best innovations come from people who took time to <strong>muse on</strong> a problem from a different perspective. Encouraging students to think creatively also makes learning more meaningful.</p>

<p>Yes, I believe it’s vital. Creative thinking often comes from calm, undistracted moments - those quiet times when you’re not actively working, but your mind is still turning over ideas. Many artists or writers have said their best thoughts came during moments of <strong>musing</strong>, like walking alone or staring out the window.</p>

<p>In a world driven by speed and productivity, people rarely pause to <strong>muse on</strong> their choices, which many result in decisions made without deeper understanding or emotional clarity.</p>
<ul>
<li>While some may view self-reflection as unproductive, others argue that quiet <strong>musings</strong> often lead to innovative ideas or better emotional regulation.</li>

<p>While knowledge forms the foundation of academic success, creativity enables students to apply that knowledge in meaningful ways. In fact, many great inventions and solutions have come from individuals who took time to <strong>muse on</strong> a problem from a new angle, rather than simply recalling facts. Moreover, encouraging students to record their <strong>musings</strong> in journals or through art can foster emotional intelligence and personal growth - qualities that are just as vital as academic skills in today’s world.</p>

  <title>Number of tourism in season</title>
  <dc:creator>Hung </dc:creator>
  <link>https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/tourism/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><em>The bar graph below show the number of tourists visiting two different cities by season. Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparison where relevant.</em></p>
<p><img src="https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/tourism/Pasted image 20250625093819.png" class="img-fluid"> The bar chart compares the number of tourists (in thousands) who visited two cities, Dover and Troy, across the four seasons: Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter.</p>
<p>Overall, Dover saw a steady increase in tourist numbers throughout the year, peaking in winter, while Troy experienced the opposite trend, with numbers peaking in summer and then sharply declining by winter. The two cities demonstrated contrasting seasonal patterns in tourism.</p>
<p>In spring, both cities received a similar number of tourists, with Dover attracting 5,000 and Troy slightly fewer at 4,800. However, during the summer months, Troy saw a dramatic surge to 23,000 visitors, more than double Dover’s figures of 10,000. In autumn, while Troy has a slight decrease to 20,000 visitors, Dover hosts increasingly to 15,000 visitors.</p>
<p>In contrast, winter brought a complete reversal in patterns. Dover’s tourist numbers peaked at 25,000, while Troy experienced a steep decline, drawing only 5,000 visitors - the lowest for the year. This stark contrast highlights Dover’s strong winter appeal and Troy’s reliance on summer tourism.</p>

</table>
<p>The table displays the average number of hours per week that people across six age groups spend using the internet for two main purposes: studying/working and leisure activities.</p>
<p>Overall, internet use for studying or working peaks in the 20s age group and gradually declines with age, while leisure-related usage remains more stable across age groups, with only moderate variation. Notably, teenagers spend more time online for leisure than for academic or work purposes, in contrast to all other age groups.</p>
<p>Young adult in their 20s spend the most time using the internet for professional or educational purposes, averaging 50 hours per week. This figure slightly decreases among those in their 30s and 40s, to 45 and 40 hours respectively, and remains at the same level for users in their 50s. Teenagers, by contrast, spend only 15 hours weekly on study or work online, while the figure drops significantly to 17 hours for users aged 60 and above.</p>
<p>In terms of leisure activities, teenagers report the highest usage at 20 hours per week. Adults in their 20s and 30s follow closely behind, with 18 and 17 hours, respectively. Usage declines further among those in their 40s and 50s, reaching 10 and 11 hours. Interestingly, leisure usage increases again among seniors (60+), who spend 18 hours per week- more than any group except teenagers.</p>

  <title>Agriculture</title>
  <dc:creator>Hung </dc:creator>
  <link>https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/essay-agriculture/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In spite of the advances made in agriculture, many people around the world still go hungry. Why is this the case? What can be done about this problem? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own experience or knowledge. Write at least 250 words.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Recent years have witnessed tremendous developments in agricultural science yet every day people all over the world continue to suffer and even die from hunger. In my opinion, this is because innovations rarely impact the developing world and the best solution for it is to direct humanitarian funding towards these advances.</p>
<p>The main cause of more advanced agricultural methods not reaching the people who need it the most is that the developing world has trouble implementing these methods. There are a number of reasons for this ranging from limited financial resources to poor existing infrastructure to political instability, depending on the country in question. One example of this would be in many African nations, where malnourishment has historically been highest. Countries like the Congo have seen revolution after revolution over the last several decades, which has effectively destabilized the entire country. The universities where students would learn about changes in agriculture are frequently shut down or destroyed. The young people who would become agricultural scientists end up drawn into the conflict as soldiers or victims. Long-term economic neglect means that the government has very limited ability to subsidies farming. These problems are present to varying degrees in countries around the world and offer one possible explanation for the continued prevalence of hunger.</p>
<p>The solution that I believe would be most effective is directing humanitarian funds previously focused on food aid towards education and agriculture. Food aid is a notoriously poor solution because it only offers an immediate solution and warlords often exploit it to support their continued mistreatment of their people. It hurts more than it helps. However, there would be better long-term effects if international organizations and governments redirects that money into helping build better farms, provide more modern equipment, and sending qualified professions to train people in need. There is a TedTalk by a young man in Kenya who built his own windmill out of old bicycle parts and reading a book in the local library. It is large enough to power irrigation channels for the entire village. If more people like him can be found or trained when this will have an impact that lasts for decades and is relatively impervious to the factors preventing agricultural advances from taking root in developing countries.</p>
<p>In conclusion, developing companies face myriad problems that hinder their ability to take advantage of newer agricultural models and we should direct more funding to helping these countries learn more about new farming methods. This is likely to be an important issue in the world as the gap between rich and poor, developed and undeveloped widens while technological progress continues its indifferent march forward.</p>

  <title>IELTS Cambridge 16 Essay - Driverless Vehicles</title>
  <dc:creator>Hung </dc:creator>
  <link>https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/driverless-vehicles/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><strong>In the future all cars, buses and trucks will be driverless. The only people travelling inside these vehicles will be passengers.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you think the advantages of driverless vehicles outweigh the disadvantages?</strong></p>
<p>A future filled with driverless vehicles is an inevitability. In my opinion, though there are concomitant moral risks, the practical import for health such a seismic shift will be positive on the whole.</p>
<p>Critics of this trend suggest that machines should not be responsible for the potential loss of human life. This argument rests on the fact when there is an accident involving humans, it is possible to either assess blame and assign punishment or accept that human error played a role. In contrast, an individual severely injured as the result of a collision caused by a machine may justly feel that all human autonomy and free will is absent from their fate. This is analogous to a natural disaster with the crucial distinction being that humanity has engineered the situation. It is human nature to prefer to control a situation rather than surrender the outcome to an autonomous machine.</p>
<p>Proponents of automated vehicles, on the other hand, argue the tangible ramifications concerning public safety. The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that driverless vehicles cause fewer accidents than humans. The reason for this is that humans are prone to errors related to fatigue, distractions such as smartphones, and, in some cases, altered states. Machines might experience the occasional technical error, however, they are far more consistent by comparison. In fact, the few accidents that have occurred with automated vehicles were the fault of human drivers. If all cars were driverless, this would enabled a greater</p>
<hr>
<p>In the coming years, it is predicted that all vehicles, including cars, buses, and trucks, will operate autonomously without human drivers. While this development may raise some concerns, I firmly believe that the advantages of driverless transportation far outweigh the disadvantages.</p>
<p>One major advantage of autonomous vehicles is improved road safety. The majority of traffic accidents today are caused by human error, including distracted driving, fatigue, and impaired judgment. Driverless vehicles, on the other hand, rely on advanced sensors, algorithms, and machine learning, which allow them to make precise decisions and maintain constant awareness of their surroundings, can process vast amount of data in real time and react faster than any human driver. This can greatly reduce accidents, save lives, and lower the burden on healthcare systems. In addition, driverless technology could improve traffic flow and reduce congestion by enabling vehicles to communicate and coordinate more efficiency.</p>
<p>However, this transformation is not without drawbacks. A major concern is job loss among professional drivers, including taxi drivers, truckers, and bus operators. The widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles could lead to large-scale unemployment in these sectors. Moreover, ethical challenges arise in situations where a vehicle must choose between two harmful outcomes, raising questions about how machines should be programmed to make such decisions.</p>
<p>Despite these issues, I believe that the long-term benefits are more compelling. The reduction in traffic accidents, the potential for greater mobility for elderly and disabled individuals, and the increase in productivity for commuters are all powerful advantages. With proactive government policies, including retraining programs and strong ethical guidelines for AI systems, the negative impacts can be mitigated.</p>
<p>In conclusion, although there are valid concerns about the rise of driverless vehicles, particularly regarding employment and ethics, the positive impacts on safety, efficiency, and accessibility make this a highly promising development. Therefore, I believe the advantages clearly outweight the disadvantages.</p>

  <title>IELTS Essay- Line Chart Social Center</title>

<p>David Lang essay:</p>
<p>The line chart details participants according to activity at a social center in the Australian city of Melbourne from 2000 to 2020. Looking from an overall perspective, it is readily apparent that participants for all activities increased to varying degrees except in terms of martial arts and amateur drama. Film club was by far the most popular activity throughout, though table tennis demonstrated the strongest growth.</p>
<p>In 2000, 64 individuals participated in the film club, a figure that dipped to 60 in 2010 and then more than recovered to finish the period at 65. The trend for martial arts was similarly stable with a beginning data point of 38, a high of 39 in 2010, and a final figure of 37.</p>
<p>The remaining activities started the period lower with 27 participants for amateur drama, 18 for table tennis, and 0 for musical performances (unavailable at the time). Over the next 10 years, amateur dramatics commenced a decline that would end at just 5 by 2020, while table tennis underwent the inverse transformation, peaking at 52 by the same year. Musical performances were only an option starting in 2005, with participants growing and leveling off to just under 20 by the end of the period.</p>

  <title>Task 1 Recycle paper</title>
  <dc:creator>Hung </dc:creator>
  <link>https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/english-recycle-paper/</link>

<p>The diagram details how recycled paper is made. Looking from an overall perspective, it is readily apparent that the process involves three main stages beginning with initial collection and transportation, followed by cleaning and processing, and lastly the rolling of the final product. The process is entirely man-made.</p>
<p>In order to produce recycled paper, used paper is first sourced and transported by conveyor belt to a processing plant. The used paper is then made into unfiltered pulp by using water and various chemicals. The pulp must then be filtered with water being removed.</p>
<p>After filtering is complete, the filtered paper pulp is sent by a tube to a container with water and soap to be further cleaned. Air is pumped into the container and ink is removed. There is then an additional cleaning with water and chemicals before the final rolling states commence. To create useable recycled paper rolls, the cleaned and filtered pulp is placed on a conveyor belt where heated rollers flatten the paper and remove excess water.</p>

<p>Useful vocab: - Recycled materials - Industrial process - Mechanical separation - De-inking - Environmental sustainability</p>
<p>The diagram illustrates the step-by-step process involved in the production of recycled paper from used paper materials. The procedure consists of four main stages, starting with the creation of pulp and culminating in the manufacture of new paper rolls.</p>
<p>In the first stage, used paper is placed on a conveyor belt and carried to a machine where it is mixed with water and chemicals. This mixture breaks the paper down into unfiltered pulp. The pulp then moves to the next stage where is it filtered. This step removes large unwanted materials, leaving behind filtered pulp.</p>
<p>In the third stage, the filtered pulp is cleaned using water, soap, and air. This helps separate and remove ink from the pulp. Water and additional chemicals are also added to enhance the cleaning process. As a result, the pulp becomes cleaner and suitable for making new paper.</p>
<p>Finally, the cleaned pulp is transferred onto a conveyor belt and passed through heated rollers. These rollers press and dry the material, forming sheets of recycled paper, which are then rolled up for reuse.</p>

<li><p>How are environmental problems dealt with in your country? In my country, environmental issues are taken seriously, but there’s still a long way to go. The government has made some rules about pollution and waste, and there are programs to plant more trees. But I think sometimes the laws are not enforced strictly, and people still throw garbage in the wrong places. In my country, environmental problems are addressed through a combination of legislation and public awareness campaigns. For instance, the government has introduced stricter regulations on industrial emissions and waste disposal. However, enforcement remains inconsistent, and public participation <strong>is not as widespread as it could be</strong>, which limits the overall effectiveness of these measures.</p></li>
<li><p>What can be done to make people recycle more often? I think if people know more about the benefits of recycling, they might do it more. Also, the government can give rewards or discounts to people who recycle. Putting more recycling bins around cities would help too. To encourage more frequent recycling, a combination of education and incentives could be effective. Public awareness campaigns can highlight the environmental and economic benefits of recycling, while practical steps- like providing more accessible recycling bins and offering financial incentives - can make the habit easier to adopt. Legislation that mandates in households and businesses could also play a significant role.</p></li>
<li><p>What is the most pressing environmental problem? In my opinion, the biggest problem is air pollution, especially in big cities. The air quality is really bad because of cars and factories. It affects people’s health, and it’s hard to fix quickly. Arguably, climate change is the most urgent environmental issue we face today. It not only exacerbates other problems like extreme weather and rising sea levels but also poses serious threats to biodiversity and food security. While localized issues like air pollution are severe, climate change has a truly global impact that requires immediate and coordinated action.</p></li>
<li><p>Is recycling a common practice in your country? Recycling is becoming more common, but it’s not something everyone does. Some people separate their trash at home, but many still throw everything together. It depends a lot on where you live - cities usually have more systems in place. Recycling is practiced in many parts of the country, particularly in urban areas where infrastructure is more developed. However, it’s far from universal. While some individuals and communities are highly conscientious, others lack access to proper facilities or are simply unaware of how to recycle effectively. So, it’s growing, but still inconsistent.</p></li>
<li><p>Are governments or individuals more responsible? I think both are responsible. The government needs to make good rules and make people follow the, but individuals also need to care about the environment and take action. It’s a shared responsibility. While both governents and individuals play vital roles, I believe governents bear greater responsibility due to their ability to enact policies, regulate industries, and invest in sustainable infrastructure. That said, individual behavior is equally crucial, as collective action often stes fro personal choices. Ideally, both should work hand in hand to address environental issues effectively.</p></li>

  <title>Transitive Verb an Intransitive Verb</title>
  <dc:creator>Hung </dc:creator>
  <link>https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/transitive-verb/transitive verbs.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>A transitive verb is a verb that requires an object to receive the action.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[!Example] Example Correct: The speaker <strong>discussed</strong> <em>different marketing strategies</em> in the video. Incorrect: The speaker <strong>discussed</strong> in the video. The verb “discuss” requires an object (“different marketing strategies”). It is necessary to state that the speaker discussed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Example Sentences:</strong></p>
<p>Some other examples of transitive verbs are “address,” “borrow,” “bring,” “discuss,” “raise,” “offer,” “pay,” “write,” “promise,” and “have.”</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The instructor <strong>addressed</strong> <em>the student’s</em> question.</p></li>
<li><p>Miriam <strong>borrowed</strong> <em>the methodology book</em> from her classmate because she forgot her copy.</p></li>
<li><p>Can you <strong>bring</strong> <em>your copy of the textbook</em> to our study group meeting?</p></li>
<li><p>The committee members <strong>will raise</strong> <em>money</em> for the new project.</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="direct-and-indirect-objects" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="direct-and-indirect-objects">Direct and Indirect Objects</h2>
<p>A transitive verb can take more than one object.</p>
<ul>
<li>Donovan <strong>gave</strong> <strong><em>his sister</em></strong> <em>a laptop</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this sentence, there is an indirect object, “his sister,” and a direct object, “a laptop.” However, there is another way to say this same idea using a prepositional phrase.</p>
<ul>
<li>Donovan <strong>gave</strong> <em>a laptop</em> to his sister. In English, an indirect object may come between a transitive verb and the direct object, as the first example sentence about Donovan, or the indirect object could be in the form of a prepositional phrase, like the second example sentence about Donovan.</li>
</ul>
<p>An indirect object is only needed if the action is being done to or for somebody, when using a transitive verb, we need to include a direct object, but we may not need to include in indirect object.</p>
</section>
<section id="finding-the-object" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="finding-the-object">Finding the object</h2>
<p>We can figure out the object by using the question format: “The subject did what?” or “The subject ‘verb’ what?” The instructor <strong>addressed</strong> what <em>the student’s question</em></p>
<p>Miriam <strong>borrowed</strong> what? <em>the methodology book</em></p>
<p>Can you <strong>bring</strong> what? <em>your copy of the textbook</em></p>
<p>The speaker <strong>discussed</strong> what? <em>different marketing strategies</em></p>
<p>The committee members <strong>will raise</strong> what? <em>money</em></p>
<p>We can find the indirect by asking the question “To whom?” or “For whom?”</p>
<p>Donovan <strong>gave</strong> <em>a laptop</em> to whom? <em>his sister</em></p>
</section>
<section id="intransitive-verbs" class="level1">
<h1>Intransitive Verbs</h1>
<p>An intransitive verb does not take an object. Using an object immediately after an intransitive verb will create an incorrect sentence. However, there may be other information after the verb, such as one or more prepositional phrases or an <em>adverb</em>.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[!Example] Example Correct: The students <strong>arrived</strong> at the residency in Houston. Incorrect: The students <strong>arrived</strong> <em>Houston</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second sentence is incorrect because the verb cannot take an object.</p>
<p><strong>Example Sentences</strong></p>
<p>Some other examples of intransitive verbs are “deteriorate”, “vote”, “sit”, “increase”, “laugh”, “originate”, “fluctuate”, and “trend”.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The patient’s health <strong>deteriorated quickly</strong>. Ahmad <strong>voted</strong> in the local election. May I <strong>sit <em>here</em></strong> Attendance&nbsp;<strong>increased</strong>&nbsp;at the weekly study sessions&nbsp;as finals drew near. Susan <strong>laughed</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: An intransitive verb can take more than one prepositional phrase of adverb.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The patient’s health <strong>deteriorated <em>quickly</em></strong> <em>during the night</em>. Ahmad <strong>voted</strong> <em>for the incumbent</em> in the local election.</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="verbs-that-are-both-transitive-and-intransitive" class="level1">
<h1>Verbs That Are Both Transitive and Intransitive</h1>
<p>Some verbs can be both transitive and intransitive, depending on the situation. In some instances, such a verb may require an object, while in others it does not require an object.</p>
<p><strong>Example Sentences</strong></p>
<p>Format reminder: <strong>verb</strong>, <em>object</em>, <strong><em>propositional phrase</em></strong>, <code>adverb</code>.</p>
<p><strong>continue</strong></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>We will <strong>continue</strong> <em>the meeting</em> after the break. (transitive) The meeting <strong>continued</strong> <strong><em>after the break</em></strong>. (intransitive)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>play</strong> &gt; Three of the students <strong>play</strong> <em>the guitar</em>. (transitive) &gt; The students will <strong>play</strong> <code>outside today</code>.</p>
<p><strong>return</strong> &gt; Javier <strong>returned</strong> <em>the book</em> to the library. (transitive) &gt; The students <strong>returned</strong> <strong><em>to school</em></strong> <strong>after the winter break</strong>_. (intransitive)</p>
<p><strong>grow</strong></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">

  <title>Farm animals and Vegetables</title>
  <dc:creator>Hung </dc:creator>
  <link>https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/english-farm-animals-vegetables/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><strong>It has been suggested that primary children should learn how to grow vegetables and keep animals.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?</strong></p>
<p>David Lang’s essay:</p>
<p>Some today have argued that it would be a sensible policy to teach children how to farm and raise animals at school. In my opinion, though this would require enormous resources, it would be beneficial in terms of both physical and intellectual development.</p>
<p>Those arguing against this proposal point out the resources needed. In order to implement such an ambitious programs, schools would firstly need land nearby where animals and crops be raised. This might be possible within a school’s pre-existing grounds, but there would still need to be significant investment in infrastructure. Schools would therefore have to reallocate a significant portion of their budget, potentially reducing the money for crucial facilities, staff, and teaching resources.</p>
<p>However, the advantages for the holistic development of children is overwhelming. Students today spend more time than ever before passively using technological devices. By spending more time outdoors learning about animals and crops, students will better understand their position within the natural food chain. Overtime, this may lead them to adopt environmentally friendlier, compassionate lifestyle choices such as becoming vegetarians or shopping locally rather than buying from large chains. Moreover, the work outdoors would necessarily involve physical exercise. Since obesity is a growing concern in most countries, this time outside could help to improve standards of physical fitness and establish healthy lifelong habits.</p>
<p>In conclusion, despite the money this reform would require, schools should adopt it when possible so as to achieve a more complete education for students. Governments should consider the long-term effects when deciding on such policies.</p>
<section id="chat-gpt" class="level1">
<h1>Chat gpt</h1>
<p>The proposal to incorporate agricultural and animal husbandry education into primary school curricula has garnered attention. In my view, while such initiatives offer certain benefits, the potential drawbacks, particularly concerning resource allocation and health risks, are more significant.</p>
<p>Advocates highlight that engaging children in growing vegetables and caring for animals can foster responsibility and a connection to nature. These activities may enhance students’ understanding of food sources and promote environmental stewardship. However, implementing such programs requires substantial resources. Schools would need to invest in appropriate land, infrastructure, and trained personnel to oversee these activities. This financial commitment could divert funds from essential academic subjects, potentially compromising the quality of core education.</p>
<p>Moreover, there are health and safety concerns associated with young children handling soil and animals. Exposure to allergens, zoonotic diseases, and physical injuries are risks that cannot be overlooked. Ensuring proper hygiene and safety measures would necessitate additional oversight and training, further straining school resources.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while teaching primary children to cultivate plants and care for animals has educational merits, the associated disadvantages, particularly in terms of resource allocation and health risks, outweigh the benefits. Schools should prioritize core academic subjects and consider integrating environmental education through less resource-intensive methods.</p>
<p>💡 Why David Lang’s Essay Feels Simple but Scores High</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Clear structure</li>
</ol>
<p>Introduction: Directly paraphrases the question + gives a clear opinion.</p>
<p>Body 1: Discusses the opposite view.</p>
<p>Body 2: Presents his own view (which he supports).</p>
<p>Conclusion: Restates the opinion and wraps up.</p>
<p>👉 Why it works: Examiners love clarity. They’re not grading you on how “fancy” your structure is — just that it’s logical and easy to follow.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Precise vocabulary, not fancy vocabulary</li>
</ol>
<p>He uses natural, topic-specific language, like:</p>
<p>“holistic development”</p>
<p>“environmentally friendlier”</p>
<p>“passively using technological devices”</p>
<p>👉 Why it works: Band 9 vocabulary is about being accurate and appropriate, not sounding like a thesaurus.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Balanced ideas + developed examples</li>
</ol>
<p>He acknowledges the disadvantages (cost, resources) and then shows why advantages outweigh them (fitness, habits, awareness). He explains his points — not just states them.</p>
<p>👉 Why it works: IELTS cares about depth more than how many ideas you list. One strong idea with support = better than five weak ones.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Grammar is natural and controlled</li>
</ol>
<p>He uses complex sentences when needed, not to show off.</p>
<p>👉 Example:</p>
<p>“Since obesity is a growing concern in most countries, this time outside could help…”</p>
<p>That’s complex, but clear. No over-complicated structures.</p>
<p>✅ How YOU Can Write Like David Lang</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Follow a clean structure</li>
</ol>
<p>Intro: Paraphrase + opinion</p>
<p>Body 1: Opposing view</p>
<p>Body 2: Your view (with examples)</p>
<p>Conclusion: Restate opinion</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Use precise, topic-relevant words</li>
</ol>
<p>Learn how to talk naturally about big topics (education, health, environment) with words that fit.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Don’t list ideas — explain them</li>
</ol>
<p>Pick 1–2 strong points per paragraph and expand with why, how, and an example.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Write like you’re explaining, not performing</li>
</ol>
<p>Pretend you’re talking to a smart friend, not an examiner. Make it natural and reasoned, not robotic or flowery.</p>
<p>✏️ Step 1: Write the Introduction</p>
<p>✅ What we need:</p>
<p>Paraphrase the question</p>
<p>Give a clear opinion</p>
<p>🧠 Example:</p>
<p>Some believe that it would be beneficial for young children to be taught farming skills at school. However, I believe that the drawbacks of such a policy outweigh the potential benefits.</p>
<p>🔍 Why this works:</p>
<p>It’s short.</p>
<p>Clear opinion.</p>
<p>No fancy words. Just focused.</p>
<p>Would you like to try writing your own version of the introduction before we move on?</p>
<p>Or should we go ahead to Body Paragraph 1?</p>

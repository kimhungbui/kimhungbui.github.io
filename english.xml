  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>In <strong>IELTS Writing Task 1 (Academic)</strong>, using a <strong>range of sentence types</strong> is crucial for achieving a <strong>Band 7 or higher</strong> in <strong>Grammatical Range and Accuracy</strong>.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of <strong>sentence types you should use</strong>, with <strong>examples</strong> tailored to data description:</p>
<section id="simple-sentences" class="level1" data-number="1">
<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Simple Sentences</h1>
<p>Used to state clear facts. - Structure: Subject + verb + object - Example: - Internet access rose in all income groups.</p>
</section>
<section id="compound-sentences" class="level1" data-number="2">
<h1 data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Compound Sentences</h1>
<p>Connect two related ideas using coordinating conjunctions (and, but, or, so, yet). - Structure: Independent clause + conjunction + independent clause. - Example: - Low-income households saw growth, but they remained behind other groups.</p>
</section>
<section id="complex-sentences" class="level1" data-number="3">
<h1 data-number="3"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Complex Sentences</h1>
<p>Used to show relationships such as cause, contrast, or time. - Structure: Independent clause + dependent clause (or vice versa) - Examples: - Although the figures increased, the gap between groups remained wide. - As time progressed, internet access became more common.</p>
</section>
<section id="passive-voice" class="level1" data-number="4">
<h1 data-number="4"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Passive Voice</h1>
<p>Useful for focusing on what happened rather than who did it (common in process/task descriptions). - Example: - A steady increase was observed in all three income categories. # Comparative Sentences Used to highlight differences or similarities. - Example: - The high-income group had nearly twice the access as the middle-income group in 2005. - Internet usage in low-income households was much lower than in the other two groups. # Superlative Sentences Used to emphasize the highest or lowest point in the data. - Example: - The high-income group had the highest internet access throughout the period. - The smallest increase was seen in the middle-income group between 2015 and 2020. # Trend Description Sentences Used to describe change over time. - Examples: - The figure rose steadily from 35% to 82%. - There was a sharp increase in internet access between 2010 and 2015.</p>
</section>
<section id="quantifying-and-grouping-sentences" class="level1" data-number="5">
<h1 data-number="5"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Quantifying and Grouping Sentences</h1>
<p>Useful when describing portions of categories. - Examples: - Over half of the middle-income households had internet access by 2015. - Only a small fraction of low-income households were online in 2005.</p>

  <title>University Enrollment</title>

<p><em>The pie charts below show enrollment in different fields of study at a particular university.</em></p>
<p><em>Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.</em> <img src="https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/uni-enroll/Pasted image 20250625100948.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The two pie charts illustrate the percentage of male and female students enrolled in four academic fields - Social Sciences, Humanities, Education, and Engineering - at Clydesdale University. Overall, male students showed a strong preference for Engineering, while female students were more inclined toward Humanities and education. Social science was the only field with relatively balanced participation between genders.</p>
<p>Engineering was the dominant choices for male students, comprising 45% of their total enrollment, more than twice the proportion of females in the same field (20%). In constrast, only 10% of men chose Humanities, while this subject attracted 30% of women - three times higher. Similarly, Education accounted for 35% of female enrollment, compared to just 20% for men.</p>
<p>The only discipline where the gender gap was moderate was Social Sciences. While a quarter of men were enrolled in this field, women followed closely behind at 15%. Although a difference exists, this subject showed the least contrast in gender representation.</p>

<p>Q17 – “…when they don’t think they’re making enough progress…give up hope…stop believing…” - these phrases are all about <strong>losing confidence or motivation</strong>. - Correct answer: B - loss of confidence Q18 – “…takes a lot of determination and hard work…lots of people don’t have that kind of commitment.” - this is about the <strong>effort and long-term dedication</strong> needed. - Correct answer C - too much effort required. 💡 Why You Missed It:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You swapped the ideas: You took “hard work” and applied it to Q17, but that part comes second.</p></li>
<li><p>In IELTS MCQs, the order of the ideas usually matches the order of the questions.</p></li>
<li><p>You may have guessed based on vocabulary, not on exact function and meaning.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Loss of confidence - lose hope too much effort required - too hard to continue feeling less successful than others - comparing yourself to another</p>

  <title>Number of tourism in season</title>
  <dc:creator>Hung </dc:creator>
  <link>https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/tourism/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><em>The bar graph below show the number of tourists visiting two different cities by season. Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparison where relevant.</em></p>
<p><img src="https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/tourism/Pasted image 20250625093819.png" class="img-fluid"> The bar chart compares the number of tourists (in thousands) who visited two cities, Dover and Troy, across the four seasons: Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter.</p>
<p>Overall, Dover saw a steady increase in tourist numbers throughout the year, peaking in winter, while Troy experienced the opposite trend, with numbers peaking in summer and then sharply declining by winter. The two cities demonstrated contrasting seasonal patterns in tourism.</p>
<p>In spring, both cities received a similar number of tourists, with Dover attracting 5,000 and Troy slightly fewer at 4,800. However, during the summer months, Troy saw a dramatic surge to 23,000 visitors, more than double Dover’s figures of 10,000. In autumn, while Troy has a slight decrease to 20,000 visitors, Dover hosts increasingly to 15,000 visitors.</p>
<p>In contrast, winter brought a complete reversal in patterns. Dover’s tourist numbers peaked at 25,000, while Troy experienced a steep decline, drawing only 5,000 visitors - the lowest for the year. This stark contrast highlights Dover’s strong winter appeal and Troy’s reliance on summer tourism.</p>

<p>The table below shows the number of hours per week people of different ages spend usin the internet for different types of activities.</p>
<p>Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.</p>
<p>Hours per week spent on the internet, by age</p>

</table>
<p>The table displays the average number of hours per week that people across six age groups spend using the internet for two main purposes: studying/working and leisure activities.</p>
<p>Overall, internet use for studying or working peaks in the 20s age group and gradually declines with age, while leisure-related usage remains more stable across age groups, with only moderate variation. Notably, teenagers spend more time online for leisure than for academic or work purposes, in contrast to all other age groups.</p>
<p>Young adult in their 20s spend the most time using the internet for professional or educational purposes, averaging 50 hours per week. This figure slightly decreases among those in their 30s and 40s, to 45 and 40 hours respectively, and remains at the same level for users in their 50s. Teenagers, by contrast, spend only 15 hours weekly on study or work online, while the figure drops significantly to 17 hours for users aged 60 and above.</p>
<p>In terms of leisure activities, teenagers report the highest usage at 20 hours per week. Adults in their 20s and 30s follow closely behind, with 18 and 17 hours, respectively. Usage declines further among those in their 40s and 50s, reaching 10 and 11 hours. Interestingly, leisure usage increases again among seniors (60+), who spend 18 hours per week- more than any group except teenagers.</p>

  <title>Agriculture</title>
  <dc:creator>Hung </dc:creator>
  <link>https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/essay-agriculture/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In spite of the advances made in agriculture, many people around the world still go hungry. Why is this the case? What can be done about this problem? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own experience or knowledge. Write at least 250 words.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Recent years have witnessed tremendous developments in agricultural science yet every day people all over the world continue to suffer and even die from hunger. In my opinion, this is because innovations rarely impact the developing world and the best solution for it is to direct humanitarian funding towards these advances.</p>
<p>The main cause of more advanced agricultural methods not reaching the people who need it the most is that the developing world has trouble implementing these methods. There are a number of reasons for this ranging from limited financial resources to poor existing infrastructure to political instability, depending on the country in question. One example of this would be in many African nations, where malnourishment has historically been highest. Countries like the Congo have seen revolution after revolution over the last several decades, which has effectively destabilized the entire country. The universities where students would learn about changes in agriculture are frequently shut down or destroyed. The young people who would become agricultural scientists end up drawn into the conflict as soldiers or victims. Long-term economic neglect means that the government has very limited ability to subsidies farming. These problems are present to varying degrees in countries around the world and offer one possible explanation for the continued prevalence of hunger.</p>
<p>The solution that I believe would be most effective is directing humanitarian funds previously focused on food aid towards education and agriculture. Food aid is a notoriously poor solution because it only offers an immediate solution and warlords often exploit it to support their continued mistreatment of their people. It hurts more than it helps. However, there would be better long-term effects if international organizations and governments redirects that money into helping build better farms, provide more modern equipment, and sending qualified professions to train people in need. There is a TedTalk by a young man in Kenya who built his own windmill out of old bicycle parts and reading a book in the local library. It is large enough to power irrigation channels for the entire village. If more people like him can be found or trained when this will have an impact that lasts for decades and is relatively impervious to the factors preventing agricultural advances from taking root in developing countries.</p>
<p>In conclusion, developing companies face myriad problems that hinder their ability to take advantage of newer agricultural models and we should direct more funding to helping these countries learn more about new farming methods. This is likely to be an important issue in the world as the gap between rich and poor, developed and undeveloped widens while technological progress continues its indifferent march forward.</p>

  <title>IELTS Cambridge 16 Essay - Driverless Vehicles</title>
  <dc:creator>Hung </dc:creator>
  <link>https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/driverless-vehicles/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><strong>In the future all cars, buses and trucks will be driverless. The only people travelling inside these vehicles will be passengers.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you think the advantages of driverless vehicles outweigh the disadvantages?</strong></p>
<p>A future filled with driverless vehicles is an inevitability. In my opinion, though there are concomitant moral risks, the practical import for health such a seismic shift will be positive on the whole.</p>
<p>Critics of this trend suggest that machines should not be responsible for the potential loss of human life. This argument rests on the fact when there is an accident involving humans, it is possible to either assess blame and assign punishment or accept that human error played a role. In contrast, an individual severely injured as the result of a collision caused by a machine may justly feel that all human autonomy and free will is absent from their fate. This is analogous to a natural disaster with the crucial distinction being that humanity has engineered the situation. It is human nature to prefer to control a situation rather than surrender the outcome to an autonomous machine.</p>
<p>Proponents of automated vehicles, on the other hand, argue the tangible ramifications concerning public safety. The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that driverless vehicles cause fewer accidents than humans. The reason for this is that humans are prone to errors related to fatigue, distractions such as smartphones, and, in some cases, altered states. Machines might experience the occasional technical error, however, they are far more consistent by comparison. In fact, the few accidents that have occurred with automated vehicles were the fault of human drivers. If all cars were driverless, this would enabled a greater</p>
<hr>
<p>In the coming years, it is predicted that all vehicles, including cars, buses, and trucks, will operate autonomously without human drivers. While this development may raise some concerns, I firmly believe that the advantages of driverless transportation far outweigh the disadvantages.</p>
<p>One major advantage of autonomous vehicles is improved road safety. The majority of traffic accidents today are caused by human error, including distracted driving, fatigue, and impaired judgment. Driverless vehicles, on the other hand, rely on advanced sensors, algorithms, and machine learning, which allow them to make precise decisions and maintain constant awareness of their surroundings, can process vast amount of data in real time and react faster than any human driver. This can greatly reduce accidents, save lives, and lower the burden on healthcare systems. In addition, driverless technology could improve traffic flow and reduce congestion by enabling vehicles to communicate and coordinate more efficiency.</p>
<p>However, this transformation is not without drawbacks. A major concern is job loss among professional drivers, including taxi drivers, truckers, and bus operators. The widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles could lead to large-scale unemployment in these sectors. Moreover, ethical challenges arise in situations where a vehicle must choose between two harmful outcomes, raising questions about how machines should be programmed to make such decisions.</p>
<p>Despite these issues, I believe that the long-term benefits are more compelling. The reduction in traffic accidents, the potential for greater mobility for elderly and disabled individuals, and the increase in productivity for commuters are all powerful advantages. With proactive government policies, including retraining programs and strong ethical guidelines for AI systems, the negative impacts can be mitigated.</p>
<p>In conclusion, although there are valid concerns about the rise of driverless vehicles, particularly regarding employment and ethics, the positive impacts on safety, efficiency, and accessibility make this a highly promising development. Therefore, I believe the advantages clearly outweight the disadvantages.</p>

  <title>IELTS Essay- Line Chart Social Center</title>
  <dc:creator>Hung </dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><img src="https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/line-chart-social-center/Pasted image 20250602163817.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>David Lang essay:</p>
<p>The line chart details participants according to activity at a social center in the Australian city of Melbourne from 2000 to 2020. Looking from an overall perspective, it is readily apparent that participants for all activities increased to varying degrees except in terms of martial arts and amateur drama. Film club was by far the most popular activity throughout, though table tennis demonstrated the strongest growth.</p>
<p>In 2000, 64 individuals participated in the film club, a figure that dipped to 60 in 2010 and then more than recovered to finish the period at 65. The trend for martial arts was similarly stable with a beginning data point of 38, a high of 39 in 2010, and a final figure of 37.</p>
<p>The remaining activities started the period lower with 27 participants for amateur drama, 18 for table tennis, and 0 for musical performances (unavailable at the time). Over the next 10 years, amateur dramatics commenced a decline that would end at just 5 by 2020, while table tennis underwent the inverse transformation, peaking at 52 by the same year. Musical performances were only an option starting in 2005, with participants growing and leveling off to just under 20 by the end of the period.</p>

  <title>Task 1 Recycle paper</title>
  <dc:creator>Hung </dc:creator>
  <link>https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/english-recycle-paper/</link>

<p>David Lang</p>
<p>The diagram details how recycled paper is made. Looking from an overall perspective, it is readily apparent that the process involves three main stages beginning with initial collection and transportation, followed by cleaning and processing, and lastly the rolling of the final product. The process is entirely man-made.</p>
<p>In order to produce recycled paper, used paper is first sourced and transported by conveyor belt to a processing plant. The used paper is then made into unfiltered pulp by using water and various chemicals. The pulp must then be filtered with water being removed.</p>
<p>After filtering is complete, the filtered paper pulp is sent by a tube to a container with water and soap to be further cleaned. Air is pumped into the container and ink is removed. There is then an additional cleaning with water and chemicals before the final rolling states commence. To create useable recycled paper rolls, the cleaned and filtered pulp is placed on a conveyor belt where heated rollers flatten the paper and remove excess water.</p>
<p>Chat GPT</p>
<ul>
<li>Overall process: cyclical but shown in a linear step-by-step format.</li>
<li>Number of stages: 4 main stages - making pulp, filtering, cleaning, and making paper.</li>
<li>Raw material: Used paper.</li>
<li>End product: Recycled paper rolls.</li>
<li>Materials/chemicals used: Water</li>
<li>Key step:</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>Used paper transported on a conveyor belt.</li>
<li>Mixed with water and chemicals - pulp.</li>
<li>Filtered to remove larger impurities.</li>
<li>Cleaned using soap, air, water -&gt; removes ink.</li>
<li>Final cleaned pulp used to make paper -&gt; heated rollers + drying.</li>
</ol>
<p>Useful vocab: - Recycled materials - Industrial process - Mechanical separation - De-inking - Environmental sustainability</p>
<p>The diagram illustrates the step-by-step process involved in the production of recycled paper from used paper materials. The procedure consists of four main stages, starting with the creation of pulp and culminating in the manufacture of new paper rolls.</p>
<p>In the first stage, used paper is placed on a conveyor belt and carried to a machine where it is mixed with water and chemicals. This mixture breaks the paper down into unfiltered pulp. The pulp then moves to the next stage where is it filtered. This step removes large unwanted materials, leaving behind filtered pulp.</p>
<p>In the third stage, the filtered pulp is cleaned using water, soap, and air. This helps separate and remove ink from the pulp. Water and additional chemicals are also added to enhance the cleaning process. As a result, the pulp becomes cleaner and suitable for making new paper.</p>
<p>Finally, the cleaned pulp is transferred onto a conveyor belt and passed through heated rollers. These rollers press and dry the material, forming sheets of recycled paper, which are then rolled up for reuse.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li><p>How are environmental problems dealt with in your country? In my country, environmental issues are taken seriously, but there’s still a long way to go. The government has made some rules about pollution and waste, and there are programs to plant more trees. But I think sometimes the laws are not enforced strictly, and people still throw garbage in the wrong places. In my country, environmental problems are addressed through a combination of legislation and public awareness campaigns. For instance, the government has introduced stricter regulations on industrial emissions and waste disposal. However, enforcement remains inconsistent, and public participation <strong>is not as widespread as it could be</strong>, which limits the overall effectiveness of these measures.</p></li>
<li><p>What can be done to make people recycle more often? I think if people know more about the benefits of recycling, they might do it more. Also, the government can give rewards or discounts to people who recycle. Putting more recycling bins around cities would help too. To encourage more frequent recycling, a combination of education and incentives could be effective. Public awareness campaigns can highlight the environmental and economic benefits of recycling, while practical steps- like providing more accessible recycling bins and offering financial incentives - can make the habit easier to adopt. Legislation that mandates in households and businesses could also play a significant role.</p></li>
<li><p>What is the most pressing environmental problem? In my opinion, the biggest problem is air pollution, especially in big cities. The air quality is really bad because of cars and factories. It affects people’s health, and it’s hard to fix quickly. Arguably, climate change is the most urgent environmental issue we face today. It not only exacerbates other problems like extreme weather and rising sea levels but also poses serious threats to biodiversity and food security. While localized issues like air pollution are severe, climate change has a truly global impact that requires immediate and coordinated action.</p></li>
<li><p>Is recycling a common practice in your country? Recycling is becoming more common, but it’s not something everyone does. Some people separate their trash at home, but many still throw everything together. It depends a lot on where you live - cities usually have more systems in place. Recycling is practiced in many parts of the country, particularly in urban areas where infrastructure is more developed. However, it’s far from universal. While some individuals and communities are highly conscientious, others lack access to proper facilities or are simply unaware of how to recycle effectively. So, it’s growing, but still inconsistent.</p></li>
<li><p>Are governments or individuals more responsible? I think both are responsible. The government needs to make good rules and make people follow the, but individuals also need to care about the environment and take action. It’s a shared responsibility. While both governents and individuals play vital roles, I believe governents bear greater responsibility due to their ability to enact policies, regulate industries, and invest in sustainable infrastructure. That said, individual behavior is equally crucial, as collective action often stes fro personal choices. Ideally, both should work hand in hand to address environental issues effectively.</p></li>

<p>A transitive verb can take more than one object.</p>
<ul>
<li>Donovan <strong>gave</strong> <strong><em>his sister</em></strong> <em>a laptop</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this sentence, there is an indirect object, “his sister,” and a direct object, “a laptop.” However, there is another way to say this same idea using a prepositional phrase.</p>
<ul>
<li>Donovan <strong>gave</strong> <em>a laptop</em> to his sister. In English, an indirect object may come between a transitive verb and the direct object, as the first example sentence about Donovan, or the indirect object could be in the form of a prepositional phrase, like the second example sentence about Donovan.</li>
</ul>
<p>An indirect object is only needed if the action is being done to or for somebody, when using a transitive verb, we need to include a direct object, but we may not need to include in indirect object.</p>
</section>
<section id="finding-the-object" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="finding-the-object">Finding the object</h2>
<p>We can figure out the object by using the question format: “The subject did what?” or “The subject ‘verb’ what?” The instructor <strong>addressed</strong> what <em>the student’s question</em></p>

<p>We can find the indirect by asking the question “To whom?” or “For whom?”</p>
<p>Donovan <strong>gave</strong> <em>a laptop</em> to whom? <em>his sister</em></p>
</section>
<section id="intransitive-verbs" class="level1">
<h1>Intransitive Verbs</h1>
<p>An intransitive verb does not take an object. Using an object immediately after an intransitive verb will create an incorrect sentence. However, there may be other information after the verb, such as one or more prepositional phrases or an <em>adverb</em>.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[!Example] Example Correct: The students <strong>arrived</strong> at the residency in Houston. Incorrect: The students <strong>arrived</strong> <em>Houston</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second sentence is incorrect because the verb cannot take an object.</p>
<p><strong>Example Sentences</strong></p>
<p>Some other examples of intransitive verbs are “deteriorate”, “vote”, “sit”, “increase”, “laugh”, “originate”, “fluctuate”, and “trend”.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The patient’s health <strong>deteriorated quickly</strong>. Ahmad <strong>voted</strong> in the local election. May I <strong>sit <em>here</em></strong> Attendance&nbsp;<strong>increased</strong>&nbsp;at the weekly study sessions&nbsp;as finals drew near. Susan <strong>laughed</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: An intransitive verb can take more than one prepositional phrase of adverb.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The patient’s health <strong>deteriorated <em>quickly</em></strong> <em>during the night</em>. Ahmad <strong>voted</strong> <em>for the incumbent</em> in the local election.</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="verbs-that-are-both-transitive-and-intransitive" class="level1">
<h1>Verbs That Are Both Transitive and Intransitive</h1>
<p>Some verbs can be both transitive and intransitive, depending on the situation. In some instances, such a verb may require an object, while in others it does not require an object.</p>

  <title>Farm animals and Vegetables</title>
  <dc:creator>Hung </dc:creator>
  <link>https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/english-farm-animals-vegetables/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><strong>It has been suggested that primary children should learn how to grow vegetables and keep animals.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?</strong></p>
<p>David Lang’s essay:</p>
<p>Some today have argued that it would be a sensible policy to teach children how to farm and raise animals at school. In my opinion, though this would require enormous resources, it would be beneficial in terms of both physical and intellectual development.</p>
<p>Those arguing against this proposal point out the resources needed. In order to implement such an ambitious programs, schools would firstly need land nearby where animals and crops be raised. This might be possible within a school’s pre-existing grounds, but there would still need to be significant investment in infrastructure. Schools would therefore have to reallocate a significant portion of their budget, potentially reducing the money for crucial facilities, staff, and teaching resources.</p>
<p>However, the advantages for the holistic development of children is overwhelming. Students today spend more time than ever before passively using technological devices. By spending more time outdoors learning about animals and crops, students will better understand their position within the natural food chain. Overtime, this may lead them to adopt environmentally friendlier, compassionate lifestyle choices such as becoming vegetarians or shopping locally rather than buying from large chains. Moreover, the work outdoors would necessarily involve physical exercise. Since obesity is a growing concern in most countries, this time outside could help to improve standards of physical fitness and establish healthy lifelong habits.</p>
<p>In conclusion, despite the money this reform would require, schools should adopt it when possible so as to achieve a more complete education for students. Governments should consider the long-term effects when deciding on such policies.</p>
<section id="chat-gpt" class="level1">
<h1>Chat gpt</h1>
<p>The proposal to incorporate agricultural and animal husbandry education into primary school curricula has garnered attention. In my view, while such initiatives offer certain benefits, the potential drawbacks, particularly concerning resource allocation and health risks, are more significant.</p>
<p>Advocates highlight that engaging children in growing vegetables and caring for animals can foster responsibility and a connection to nature. These activities may enhance students’ understanding of food sources and promote environmental stewardship. However, implementing such programs requires substantial resources. Schools would need to invest in appropriate land, infrastructure, and trained personnel to oversee these activities. This financial commitment could divert funds from essential academic subjects, potentially compromising the quality of core education.</p>
<p>Moreover, there are health and safety concerns associated with young children handling soil and animals. Exposure to allergens, zoonotic diseases, and physical injuries are risks that cannot be overlooked. Ensuring proper hygiene and safety measures would necessitate additional oversight and training, further straining school resources.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while teaching primary children to cultivate plants and care for animals has educational merits, the associated disadvantages, particularly in terms of resource allocation and health risks, outweigh the benefits. Schools should prioritize core academic subjects and consider integrating environmental education through less resource-intensive methods.</p>
<p>💡 Why David Lang’s Essay Feels Simple but Scores High</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Clear structure</li>
</ol>
<p>Introduction: Directly paraphrases the question + gives a clear opinion.</p>
<p>Body 1: Discusses the opposite view.</p>
<p>Body 2: Presents his own view (which he supports).</p>
<p>Conclusion: Restates the opinion and wraps up.</p>
<p>👉 Why it works: Examiners love clarity. They’re not grading you on how “fancy” your structure is — just that it’s logical and easy to follow.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Precise vocabulary, not fancy vocabulary</li>
</ol>
<p>He uses natural, topic-specific language, like:</p>
<p>“holistic development”</p>
<p>“environmentally friendlier”</p>
<p>“passively using technological devices”</p>
<p>👉 Why it works: Band 9 vocabulary is about being accurate and appropriate, not sounding like a thesaurus.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Balanced ideas + developed examples</li>
</ol>
<p>He acknowledges the disadvantages (cost, resources) and then shows why advantages outweigh them (fitness, habits, awareness). He explains his points — not just states them.</p>
<p>👉 Why it works: IELTS cares about depth more than how many ideas you list. One strong idea with support = better than five weak ones.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Grammar is natural and controlled</li>
</ol>
<p>He uses complex sentences when needed, not to show off.</p>
<p>👉 Example:</p>
<p>“Since obesity is a growing concern in most countries, this time outside could help…”</p>
<p>That’s complex, but clear. No over-complicated structures.</p>
<p>✅ How YOU Can Write Like David Lang</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Follow a clean structure</li>
</ol>
<p>Intro: Paraphrase + opinion</p>
<p>Body 1: Opposing view</p>
<p>Body 2: Your view (with examples)</p>
<p>Conclusion: Restate opinion</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Use precise, topic-relevant words</li>
</ol>
<p>Learn how to talk naturally about big topics (education, health, environment) with words that fit.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Don’t list ideas — explain them</li>
</ol>
<p>Pick 1–2 strong points per paragraph and expand with why, how, and an example.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Write like you’re explaining, not performing</li>
</ol>
<p>Pretend you’re talking to a smart friend, not an examiner. Make it natural and reasoned, not robotic or flowery.</p>
<p>✏️ Step 1: Write the Introduction</p>
<p>✅ What we need:</p>
<p>Paraphrase the question</p>
<p>Give a clear opinion</p>
<p>🧠 Example:</p>
<p>Some believe that it would be beneficial for young children to be taught farming skills at school. However, I believe that the drawbacks of such a policy outweigh the potential benefits.</p>
<p>🔍 Why this works:</p>
<p>It’s short.</p>
<p>Clear opinion.</p>
<p>No fancy words. Just focused.</p>
<p>Would you like to try writing your own version of the introduction before we move on?</p>
<p>Or should we go ahead to Body Paragraph 1?</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><strong>In the past, knowledge was contained in books. Nowadays, knowledge is uploaded to the internet. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?</strong></p>
<p>It is a fact of modern life that most information today is store online, rather than in physical books as it was in the past. In my opinion, this is a negative despite its obvious conveniences.</p>
<p>Supporters of this trend can point to the numerous ways knowledge kept online can be disseminated and used. Online information is almost universally accessible, narrowing socioeconomic differences in society and allowing for various conveniences. First of all, users can find relevant information on search engines from a wide range of sources including user-generated sites like Wikipedia to news outlets like The New York Times and academic journals as well. Once an individual locates the information they are looking for, it is also easier to search within that article, share it with others, have it wherever they go and store more than would be possible if it were a hard copy.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, storing information online encourages a dependence on computer technology that is harmful for the human mind. In the past, if a person wanted to research a given topic, they would have to check out a library book or talk with an expert. This process was much slower and open to the possibility of bias. However, it also meant that individuals were more conscientious and patiently learned from fuller, more nuanced sources. Nowadays, most people read short articles, hastily written to attract more clicks and generate advertising revenue. These tap into a fundamental human need to be constantly engaged and feeling pleasure. Over time, this has led to a generation addicted to devices, lacking the healthy habits engendered by careful research and study.</p>
<p>In conclusion, despite the handiness of online information, the impact on the human psyche makes this a negative trend on level. Individuals must themselves find ways to counter these potentially injurious effects.</p>
<p>Sample positive essay:</p>
<p>In the digital age, the migration of knowledge from physical books to online platforms has become a defining feature of global society. While critics argue that this shift undermines intellectual depth and fosters dependency, I firmly believe the advantages of accessible, dynamic, and. collaborative information far surpass its drawbacks.</p>
<p>Proponent of online knowledge store emphasize its unparalleled capacity to democratize information. Unlike traditional books, which are more constrained by physical availability and cost, digital platforms grant instantaneous access to vast repositories of data for anyone with an internet connection. Students in remote villages, for instance, can now access lectures from Ivy League universities, download academic journals, or participate in global forums - opportunities once reserved for the socioeconomically privileged. Moreover, search engines and algorithms allow users to pinpoint precise information within seconds, a task that previously required hours of library search. The integration of multimedia - such as video, interactive graphs, and hyperlinks- further enriches understanding, catering to diverse learning styles. Crucially, digital storage eliminates the environmental toll of paper production, reducing deforestation and carbon emissions linked to printing and distributing physical books.</p>
<p>Detractors, however, contend that the internet fosters misinformation, distraction, and superficial engagement. While valid, these concern are not insurmountable. It is true that unverified content proliferates online, yet this issue is counterbalanced by the rise of fact-checking tools, peer-reviewed databases, and digital literacy programs that empower users to discern credible sources. Similarly, although the constant influx of notifications and bite-sized content risks fragmenting attentions spans, individuals and educators can cultivate disciplined usage through structured learning frameworks and mindfulness practices. The digital divide-limited internet access in impoverished regions - remains a challenge, yet global initiatives to expand connectivity, such as satellite internet projects and affordable mobile data, are steadily bridging this gap.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the transition to online knowledge storage represents a net positive for humanity. Its capacity to democratize education, enhance efficiency, and promote sustainability far outweighs manageable risks like misinformation and distraction. To maximize benefits, society must prioritize digital literacy and equitable access, ensuring the internet remains a force for collective progress.</p>
<section id="speaking" class="level1">
<h1>Speaking</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li>How often do most people use the internet? Most people use the internet daily, if not constantly. Smartphones and Wi-Fi have made it ubiquitous whether for work, social media, or streaming. For instance, younger generations might spend 6+ hours online, while older adults might use it less frequently but still rely on it for news or banking.</li>
<li>Are there drawbacks to its overuse? Absolutely. Overuse can lead to addiction, reduced productivity, and mental issues like anxiety or loneliness. Physically, screen time strains eyes and disrupts sleep. Socially, it erodes face-to-face interactions - think of families ignoring each other to scroll through phones. Moderation is key.</li>
<li>What kind of information can people find online? Virtually <em>anything</em>. From academic research on Google Scholar to DIY tutorials on Youtube, and even niche forums discussing obscure hobbies. However, misinformation is rampant too - fake news, biased articles, or conspiracy theories. Critical thinking is essential to navigate this flood of data.</li>
<li>How was this changed the way people get their information? It’s deepen integration into daily life. Think smart homes controlled via apps, AI-driven healthcare consultations, or virtual reality workspaces. However, privacy concerns will grow, and the digital divide may widen unless access becomes universal. Education and jobs will increasingly depend on digital literacy.</li>

  <title>How to Structure a ‘Two Question’ Essay</title>
  <dc:creator>Hung </dc:creator>
  <link>https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/two-question-essay/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Let’s look at an example of this kind of question:</p>
<pre><code>*Nowadays governments are investing more in public transport such as buses and trains rather than in building new roads.*
*What are the reasons for this?*
*Is this a positive or negative development?*</code></pre>
<section id="clear-position" class="level1">
<h1>Clear position</h1>
<p>For this kind of task we need to discuss both questions. In the first question, we are given a situation and asked to explain why. The second question requires a clear opinion so <strong>we must choose a side.</strong> This is very important for our task response score. If we don’t choose a side and support that ‘position’ clearly, we will lose marks for our task response. We will get a maximum of 5 for task achievement if we do not choose a side.</p>
<p>It’s not important which side we choose as long as we choose one. Here are the options for the second questions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Agree</strong>: We think it’s a positive development that governments are spending more money on public transport. We support this opinion.</li>
<li><strong>Disagree:</strong> We think it’s a negative development that governments are spending more money on public transport. We support this opinion.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="clear-essay-structure" class="level1">
<h1>Clear essay structure</h1>
<p>David Lang recommend that we should give our opinion in the introduction as well as the conclusion (for all IELTS Task 2 questions). It’s OK to write a very general introduction and leave our opinion to the end. But it’s not as clear and we might run out of time before we’ve hot to our conclusion, so overall it’s a risky strategy. If we don’t choose a side and support that ‘position’ clearly, we will lose marks for our task response.</p>
<p>Therefore, him suggested essay structure is four paragraphs. The opinion is presented in the introduction and re-stated in the conclusion. Ideally each body paragraph in the introduction and re-stated in the conclusion.</p>
</section>
<section id="possible-essay-structures" class="level1">

  <title>IELTS Essay Having Children at an Older Age</title>
  <dc:creator>Hung </dc:creator>
  <link>https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/having-children-at-older-age/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Question:</p>
<p><strong>Some people choose to have their first child at an older age.</strong> <strong>What are the reasons?</strong> <strong>Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?</strong></p>
<p>David Lang’s sample In recent years, an increasing number of individuals have opted to start their families later in life. This trend raises the question of why more people are choosing to have their first child at an older age and whether the benefits of doing so justify the drawbacks.</p>
<p>One of the primary reasons for delaying parenthood is the pursuit of career stability in a worrying economic climate. In today’s competitive job market, many individuals, particularly women, prefer to establish themselves professionally before starting a family. By focusing on their careers in their twenties and early thirties, they can achieve financial security and attain higher positions, which often translates to job satisfaction and greater resources for their future children. This growing trend is reflected in how mainstream society now places significant emphasis on personal development and achieving personal goals before embarking on parenthood. For that reason, many young adults prioritize their own personal and financial welfare, a situation that engenders an atmosphere less conductive to having children early in life.</p>
<p>There are legitimate disadvantages connected with having children later in life. One of the primary concerns is the potential health risks for both the mother and the child. Advanced maternal age is often associated with a higher risk of complications such as gestational diabetes, hypertension, and chromosomal abnormalities. However, despite these drawbacks, the advantages of having children later in life due to greater maturity overshadow the hypothetical drawbacks. The emotional maturity and life experience that older parents bring to child-rearing can result in a more stable and nurturing environment. Older parents are likely to be more financially secure and better prepared to provide for their children’s education and well-being. The ability to make well-considered decisions and the patience developed over time can contribute to a more thoughtful and deliberate approach to parenting.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while there are valid concerns regarding the health risks associated with having children later in life, the benefits, such as financial stability, emotional maturity, and better preparation for parenthood, outweigh these disadvantages. As societal norms and medical advancements continue to evolve, the rend of delaying parenthood is likely to remain prevalent, reflecting the changing priorities and values of modern individuals.</p>
<p>Sample, disadvantages over advantages.</p>
<p>An increasing number of individuals are choosing to have their first child at an older age. This trend is driven by factors such as career prioritization, financial security, and a desire for greater personal maturity. While some argue that the benefits of delayed parenthood - like improved financial stability and enhanced life experience - outweigh the disadvantages, I strongly disagree. The potential health risks, fertility issues, and other practical challenges mean that the disadvantages ultimately outweigh any advantages.</p>
<p>Modern society has shifted priorities, and many couples now postpone parenthood for several reasons. Primarily, individuals strive to establish their careers and achieve financial stability before starting a family. This approach allows prospective parents to create a secure environment for their child, free from economic uncertainty. Furthermore, many believe that greater life experience and emotional maturity can lead to more thoughtful parenting decisions. As a result, the decision to delay having a first child is often seen as a strategic move to optimize one’s personal and professional circumstances.</p>
<p>Despite these reasons, the drawbacks of having a first child at an older age are significant. Health concerns are paramount; older mothers face increased risks of pregnancy complications, such as gestational diabetes and hypertension, which can jeopardize both maternal and infant health. Additionally, advancing age is closely linked to decreased fertility, often necessitating expensive and emotionally draining fertility treatments. Beyond health, older parents might experience reduced physical stamina, which is crucial for the demanding nature of childcare, and a larger generational gap that can affect the parent-child relationship. These challenges make the prospect of delayed parenthood less attractive, as the risks and long-term implications overshadow the benefits of waiting.</p>
<p>In conclusion, although delaying parenthood may provide some advantages in terms of financial and emotional preparedness, the significant health risks, fertility challenges, and practical issues associated with having a first child later in life outweigh these benefit. Therefore, i contend that the disadvantages of postponing parenthood ultimately make it a less favorable option compared to earlier family planning.</p>
<p>Sample, advantages over disadvantages.</p>
<p>In recent years, an increasing number of individuals have chosen to have their first child at an older age. This trend is largely influenced by factors such as the pursuit of career goals, the desire for financial stability, and the accumulation of life experience before entering parenthood. I firmly believe that these advantages not only lead to more secure and thoughtful family planning but also contribute to improved parenting outcomes, ultimately outweighing the potential disadvantages.</p>
<p>Modern societal shifts have prompted many prospective parents to postpone starting a family. Primarily, individuals are keen to establish a stable career and secure a robust financial foundation before welcoming a child. This approach allows them to create a nurturing environment where the child’s needs are met without the stress of <strong>economic uncertainty</strong>. Furthermore, waiting until later in life often results in enhanced emotional maturity and life experience, enabling parents to make more considered decisions and effectively manage the challenges of raising a child. These reasons underscore why many see value in delaying parenthood as a strategic, long-term investment in both personal and familial well-being.</p>
<p>The advantages of choosing to have a child at an older age are manifold. With a well-established career and financial security, older parents are better equipped to provide for their child’s educational and extracurricular needs, contributing to the child’s overall development. In addition, greater maturity and life experience often translate into more patient, empathetic, and balanced parenting. Such parents typically possess enhanced problem-solving skills and resilience, which can be invaluable when navigating the inevitable challenges of childcare. Moreover, studies have shown that older parents tend to invest more time and resources in their children’s upbringing, resulting in a more stable and nurturing home environment. Collectively, these advantages not only promote healthier family dynamics but also pave the way for the child’s long-term success and well-being.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while there are inherent challenges associated with delayed parenthood, the benefits- ranging from financial stability and career establishment to increased emotional maturity and effective parenting- clearly outweigh the drawbacks. By choosing to have a child at an older age, many individuals are better prepared to offer a secure, supportive, and enriching environment for their children, ultimately leading to more positive outcomes for families.</p>

  <title>IELTS Essay Financial Matters</title>
  <dc:creator>Hung </dc:creator>
  <link>https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/financial-matters/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Question:</p>
<p><strong>In numerous nations, there is a growing trend for individuals to frequently discuss financial matters, such as their earnings or expenditure, in everyday conversation</strong>. <strong>What are the reasons behind this phenomenon?</strong> <strong>Is it advantageous or detrimental?</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>There is an increasing tendency for individuals in the modern world to openly discuss their finances in daily conversation. In my opinion, this is a result of a general lack of self-awareness and is decidedly negative given the opportunity cost it engenders.</p>
<p>The primary reason many people are prone to talk their financial dealings originates in society generally. In the past, a sense of modesty or concern for decorum might have compelled reticence. Today, some of the most widely discussed topics in the media, online, in film, and in literature concern cryptocurrencies, the real estate market, stock equities, the price of gold, and other investments. A person discussing these matters is likely only interested in subtle boasting if venting frustrations without awareness of the emotions or engagement of their interlocutor. The result over time has been that many people have developed a shameless habit.</p>
<p>In my view, discussion finances often precludes a number of more worthwhile topics of conversation. Since the majority of useful financial research can be conducted online or done in professional settings, there are more pressing areas that should be discussed in daily life. For example, two friends having a conversation at a cafe would derive greater value from telling stories, joking with one another, or delving into a more serious topic related to politics, the arts, or psychology. Such discussions are likely to develop their understanding of the world and their emotional intelligence. Discussion of money, on the other hand, wastes valuable time and energy for little concrete outcome.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the inclination to speak of one’s personal finances stems from a fundamentally modern self-indulgence and often prevents the discussion of more enjoyable or meaningful topics. Naturally, these generalizations do not apply to all individuals.</p>
<hr>
<p>ChatGPT’s essay:</p>
<p>In numerous nations, a growing trend has emerged where people openly discuss financial matters, including their earnings and expenditures, in everyday conversations. This phenomenon can be attributed to a range of social and economic factors, and i firmly believe that it is advantageous. Open dialogue about personal finances not only foster financial literacy but also encourages better money management and transparency within communities.</p>
<p>One primary reason for this trend is the rapid spread of financial education and the influence of digital media. With the advent of social media platforms and financial blogs, individuals have unprecedented access to information about budgeting, investing, and saving. This exposure has led many to feel more confident in discussing their financial situations, as they seek advice and validation from peers. Additionally, economic uncertainty in many regions has prompted individuals to share personal financial experiences as a way of coping and learning from one another. For instance, during periods of economic downturn, people often exchange tips on reducing expenses or finding alternative income sources. This collective sharing not only helps individuals navigate challenging time but also creates a support network where practical financial strategies are exchanged openly.</p>
<p>The open discussion of financial matters carries significant benefits for both individuals and society at large. Firstly, it promotes financial literacy by normalizing conversations about money, which can demystify complex financial topic and empower people to make informed decisions. As people become more knowledgeable about financial planning and investment strategies, they are better equipped to secure their futures and contribute to economic growth. Secondly, this trend encourages transparency and accountability, reducing the stigma around discussing personal finances. For example, when individuals talk about budgeting and debt management, it can inspire others to examine their own spending habits, ultimately leading to a more financially responsible community. By fostering an environment where financial struggles and successes are shared openly, society as a whole benefits from improved financial stability and reduced inequality.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the increasing tendency for individuals to discuss financial matters in everyday conversation is driven by greater access to information and a need for mutual support during uncertain economic times. I contend that this development is advantageous, as it enhances financial literacy, transparency, and responsible money management. Ultimately, such open dialogue can empower communities to achieve greater financial stability and economic well-being.</p>

  <title>IELTS Essay Writing by Hand</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Question:</p>
<p><strong>Fewer and fewer people today write by hand using a pen or pencil.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What are the reasons for this?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Is this a positive or a negative development?</strong></p>
<p>David Lang’s essay:</p>
<p>Today, the act of writing by hand using a pen or pencil has become increasingly uncommon. This essay will delve into the reasons behind this trend and evaluate whether it is a positive or negative development for individuals and society as a whole.</p>
<p>One primary reason for the dwindling use of handwriting is the pervasive presence of technology. Inn an age dominated by computers, smartphones, and tables, individuals find it more convenient to type their thoughts and ideas rather than engaging in the laborious process of writing by hand. The speed and efficiency offered by digital devices have made it easier to edit, store, and share written content, rendering handwriting seemingly obsolete. To illustrate this, consider the rapid rise of communication platforms such as email, instant messaging apps, and social media. These platforms provide users with the ability to effortlessly send and receive messages, eliminating the need for handwritten letters or notes. This convenience extends to practical considerations for professionals in various fields, such as journalists, researchers, and writers, who often rely on digital platforms and word processors for their work. The ease of editing, revising, and sharing digital content outweighs the traditional pen-and-paper approach.</p>
<p>While the decline of handwriting may offer certain advantages, it also brings forth potential negative consequences. Handwriting is an essential skill that fosters cognitive development, improves memory retention, and allows for creative expression. The act of physically forming letters and words engages different areas of the brain, promoting better comprehension and critical thinking skills. Losing this skill may hinder individuals ability to think and express themselves effectively. Most importantly, the personal touch and emotional connection associated with handwritten letters or cards cannot be replicated by digital alternatives. Handwritten messages convey sincerity, thoughtfulness, and a see of intimacy. Losing the art of handwriting may irrevocably erode these meaningful human connections.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the decline of handwriting can be attributed to the prevalence of technology and practical considerations. While there are advantages to digital communication and typing, the negative implications for cognitive development and personal connections are more significant and must be mitigated by the relevant authorities.</p>
<p>Arguing that it is a positive development</p>
<p>In today’s digital age, fewer and fewer people write by hand and using a pen or pencil. This shift can be attributed to pared technological advancements and changing educational practices, and I firmly believe that it is a positive development. The move away from handwriting not only enhances efficiency and accessibility but also reflects progress towards modern communication methods.</p>
<p>The decline in handwriting is primarily driven by the ubiquity of digital devices and evolving communication needs. With the widespread availability of computers, smartphones, and tablets, individuals find it more convenient to type and send messages instantly. Educational institutions are increasingly incorporating technology into their curricula, emphasizing digital literacy over traditional penmanship. Moreover, the rise of social media and email as primary communication tools has diminished the need for handwritten correspondence. These factors have collectively contributed to a cultural shift where efficiency and speed in communication are prioritized over the art of handwriting.</p>
<p>Transitioning from handwriting to digital writing brings several significant benefits. Firstly, digital communication enhances productivity by enabling rapid information exchange and easy editing, which is especially beneficial in professional and academic settings. Additionally, typing reduces issues related to illegible handwriting, thereby minimizing misunderstandings. Digital platforms also offer vast storage and the ability to search through documents instantly, streamlining information management. Furthermore, this shift is environmentally friendly, as it reduces the consumption of paper and other stationery supplies. Overall, the adoption of digital writing foster greater accessibility and adaptability in our fast-pace, globalized world, contributing to more efficient and sustainable practices.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the decreasing reliance on handwriting in favor of digital communication is driven by technological advancements and evolving social practices. I contend that this development is positive, as it significantly boosts efficiency, clarity, and environmental sustainability while aligning with the demands of modern life. Embracing digital writing is not only a natural progression but also a vital step towards more effective and accessible communication in the 21st century.</p>

  <title>IELTS Writing Task 2 - Topic Sentences – The Fastest Way to Improve your Score</title>
  <dc:creator>Hung </dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<section id="what-are-topic-sentence" class="level1">
<h1>What are topic sentence ?</h1>
<p>The standard essay structure for a IELTS Task 2 essay is four paragraphs - an introduction, two body paragraphs and a conclusion.</p>
<p>The topic sentence is the first sentence of each body paragraph. It tells the examiner the main idea of the paragraph so it functions like a mini introduction.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-are-topic-sentences-important" class="level1">
<h1>Why are Topic Sentences Important?</h1>
<p>Good topic sentences help to make our paragraphs clear and easy to read.</p>
<p>As we can see from the table below, clear paragraphs really help our coherence and cohesion score.</p>

<section id="how-to-write-a-good-topic-sentence" class="level1">
<h1>How to Write a Good Topic Sentence ?</h1>
<p>A good topic sentence should be clear and simple.</p>
<p>A basic topic sentence has two parts: 1. The topic. 2. The reason / main idea. ![[18920776_935567866585887_4103732896360495495_o-768x575.jpg]]</p>
<p><strong>Example Question</strong></p>
<pre><code>Global warming/Climate change are pressing problems that every country and the world will have to deal with in the future.
What are the causes of global warming ?
What are some possible solutions ?</code></pre>
<p><strong>Body paragraph 1 (the main cause of global warming)</strong> Topic: the main cause of global warming Reason/ main idea: mass consumption of fossil fuels</p>
<p>So the topic sentence is: The main cause of climate change is the mass consumption of fossil fuels.</p>
<p><strong>Body paragraph 2 (a possible solution)</strong></p>
<p>Topic: one possible solution for dealing with global warming Reason/main idea: higher taxes on automobiles</p>
<p>The topic sentence is: One possible solution for dealing with climate change could be higher taxes on automobiles.</p>
</section>
<section id="topic-sentence-will-help-us-to-stay-married-to-one-main-idea." class="level1">
<h1>Topic sentence will help us to stay married to one main idea.</h1>
<p>As we saw in the table above, we should “present a clear central topic within each paragraph”. This means each body paragraph should be focused on just one main idea.</p>
<p>Therefore planning for our topic sentences helps us to decide what is the main idea for that paragraph.</p>
<p>After that we should ONLY think of support for that idea. We are married to that main idea. We can’t cheat on it with another main idea.</p>
<p>So for the following topic sentence, we should only discuss the mass consumption of fuels.</p>
<pre><code>The main cause of climate change is the mass consumption of fossil fuels.</code></pre>
<p>Some students spend nearly the whole paragraph discussing one main idea. But then near the end, they seem to panic or get overexcited, and suddenly add a second unrelated idea e.g.&nbsp;deforestation or methane emissions from animals. This is a very common mistake but as the table above showed this will lower our coherence and cohesion score. Remember each paragraph can only have “one central topic”. As part of our planning stage in the task 2 writing exam, we should write down our topic sentences. This will make it easier when we start writing our essay to keep our supporting ideas clear, and focused on our main idea. If we accidentally include a second main idea at the end - cross it out. Stay focused.</p>

<h2 data-number="7.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="topic-literature"><span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> Topic: Literature</h2>
<p>IELTS Speaking Part 2 – Cue Card Sample</p>
<p>❓Describe an exhibition or display you have seen that left an impression on you.</p>
<p>You should say:</p>
<p>What the exhibition was about</p>
<p>Where you saw it</p>
<p>What was on display</p>
<p>And explain why it left an impression on you</p>
<p>Last year, I went to a university open day, and there was a very interesting exhibition about British literature in the 19th century, focusing on Charles Dickens. It was prepared by students from the English department, and it showed how Dickens’s novels were connected to life in that time.</p>
<p>The display had big posters with summaries of some of his books like Oliver Twist, Bleak House, and Nicholas Nickleby. Each book had a theme. For example, Oliver Twist was used to show poverty and how poor children didn’t go to school. Nicholas Nickleby had some parts about entertainment, because it mentioned a group of actors. There were also quotes from the books and short explanations about social problems.</p>
<p>What impressed me was how literature could help people learn about the past. I always thought novels were just stories, but this exhibition showed me that they can also talk about important social issues, like education, justice, and even women’s lives. I think it was a very creative and meaningful way to present history.</p>
<p>Do you think literature can still influence society today?</p>
<p>Band 7 Answer:</p>
<p>Yes, I think so. Literature helps people see the problems in society. Even today, many writers talk about topics like racism, poverty, or climate change. These books make people think, and maybe change their opinions. Like in the past, Dickens used his novels to show people how poor families lived, and some authors do similar things today.</p>
<p>❓Why do some authors choose to write about social issues?</p>
<p>Band 7 Answer:</p>
<p>I believe they want to help or teach people. Some writers care about problems in society, so they use their books to talk about them. It’s a way to send a message, and maybe make people care more. For example, Dickens wanted people to know about the bad conditions for poor people, and that’s why he showed those things in his books.</p>
<p>❓Do you think historical literature is still relevant today?</p>
<p>Band 7 Answer:</p>
<p>Yes, I think old books still have value. Even if the language is old, the ideas are similar. Many stories talk about things we still see today, like unfair laws, rich and poor people, or family problems. Also, reading historical books can help us understand the culture and life in the past.</p>

<section id="topic-rural-development-sustainability" class="level2" data-number="7.2">
<h2 data-number="7.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="topic-rural-development-sustainability"><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Topic: Rural Development &amp; Sustainability</h2>
<p><strong>Question 1: What are the biggest challenges facing rural areas in developing countries?</strong></p>
<p>Band 7 Answer:</p>
<p>I think one of the main challenges is the lack of water. In dry or arid areas, people can’t grow enough crops because there’s no dependable water supply. Another problem is transportation. Farmers sometimes grow produce, but they can’t get it to the market, so it gets spoiled. Also, I think there are not enough jobs, so people rely too much on natural resources like forests, for example cutting trees to make charcoal, which is not sustainable.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>One major challenge is definitely access to water, especially in regions that are dry and arid. Without a dependable water supply, it’s incredibly difficult to support agriculture, which is often the main source of income. Another issue is the lack of infrastructure — things like roads and transport systems — which makes it hard for farmers to get their produce to market. As a result, a lot of food ends up being spoiled. I’d also say that over-reliance on natural resources, like cutting down trees for charcoal, leads to environmental degradation, which is not sustainable in the long run</p>
<p><strong>Question 2: What kinds of development programmes are most effective in rural communities?</strong></p>
<p>Programmes that support agriculture are really useful. For example, if there is a river nearby, they can build irrigation systems to help with farming. I also think helping people learn new techniques like food preservation or fish farming can make a big difference. It’s better when the community is involved and provides labour because that makes them feel responsible.</p>
<p>Programs that focus on sustainable farming practices tend to be the most effective. For instance, setting up irrigation systems using nearby rivers can make a huge difference in crop production. It’s also important to involve the local community directly. When people contribute their own labour or make suggestions — like introducing beekeeping or fish farming — they’re more invested in the success of the project. I think combining technical support with community engagement creates the best outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Question 3: Do you think governments or local communities should take the lead in rural development?</strong></p>
<p>Band 7 Answer:</p>
<p>Both should work together. Governments can give funding and support, but local people know their land and what works. For example, in one case, local farmers suggested starting bee colonies, which wasn’t in the original plan, but it worked well. So, community ideas should be listened to.</p>
<p>I believe both have important roles to play. Governments can provide funding, training, and help with the design and long-term planning of development programmes. But local communities know their environment best and often come up with creative, practical solutions that outsiders might overlook. For example, in one case, farmers suggested starting bee colonies, which weren’t part of the original plan, but ended up becoming a valuable source of income. So collaboration between both sides is key.</p>

  <title>Type of collocations</title>
  <dc:creator>Hung </dc:creator>
  <link>https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/collocation-4/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>There are many different types of collocation. Here are some examples</p>
<section id="adjectives-and-nouns" class="level1" data-number="1">
<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Adjectives and nouns</h1>
<p>Notice adjectives that are typically used with particular nouns.</p>
<p>Emma always wears red or yellow or some other <strong>bright color</strong>.</p>
<p>We had a <strong>brief chat</strong> about the exams but didn’t have time to discuss them properly.</p>
<p>Unemployment is a <strong>major problem</strong> for the government at the moment.</p>
<p>Improving the health service is another <strong>key issue</strong> for government.</p>
</section>
<section id="nouns-and-verbs" class="level1" data-number="2">
<h1 data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Nouns and Verbs</h1>
<p>Notice how nouns and verbs often go together. The examples below are all to do with economics and business.</p>
<p>The economy boomed in the 1990s. (the economy was very strong)</p>
<p>The company has grown and now employs 50 more people than last year.</p>
<p>The company has expanded and now has branches in most major cities.</p>
<p>The two companies merged in 2013 and now form one very large corporation.</p>
<p>The company launched the product in 2012.</p>
<p>The price increase <strong>poses a problem</strong> for us.</p>
<p>The internet has created opportunities for our business.</p>

  <title>Finding, recording and learning collocations</title>

<section id="finding-collocations" class="level1" data-number="1">
<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Finding collocations</h1>
<p>There are two main ways in which we can find collocations</p>
<ul>
<li>We can train ourselves to notice them whenever we read or listen to anything in English.</li>
</ul>
<p>Look at the collocations that are worth learning from this short text in English.</p>
<p><em>After <strong>giving</strong> Mark a <strong>lift</strong> to the airport, Julie <strong>made her way</strong> home. What an exciting <strong>life</strong> he <strong>led</strong>! At times Julie felt <strong>desperately jealous</strong> of him. She <strong>spent her time</strong> doing little more than <strong>taking care of</strong> him and the children. Now her sister was <strong>getting divorced</strong> and would doubtless be making demands on her too. Julie had promised to <strong>give</strong> her sister <strong>a call</strong> as soon as she got home but she decided to <strong>run</strong> herself a <strong>bath</strong> first. She had a <strong>sharp pain</strong> in her side and hoped that a hot bath might <strong>ease the pain</strong>.</em></p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Get into the habit of making a note of any good collocations you come across in any English text you read.</p>
</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li>We can find them in any good learner’s dictionary. For example, if we look up the word <em>sharp</em> we will find some of these collocations</li>
</ul>
<p>a sharp pain</p>
<p>a sharp bend/turn</p>
<p>a sharp contrast/difference/distinction</p>
<p>a sharp rise/increase/drop</p>
<div class="callout callout-style-default callout-tip callout-titled">

<i class="callout-icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="callout-title-container flex-fill">
Tip
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>When you look up a new word, make a point of noting it down in several different collocations.</p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<section id="recording-collocations" class="level1" data-number="2">
<h1 data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Recording collocations</h1>
<p>The best way to record a collocation is in a phrase or a sentence showing how it is used. Highlight the collocation by underlining it or by using a highlight pen.</p>
<p>For example: I don’t <u>have access to</u> that kind of secret information.</p>
<p>Or: Jim gave me a very useful <span style="background:#fff88f">piece of advice</span>.</p>
</section>
<section id="learning-collocations" class="level1" data-number="3">
<h1 data-number="3"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Learning collocations</h1>
<p>Learning collocations is not so different from learning any vocabulary item. The key things are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>regularly revise what we want to learn</li>
<li>practice using what we want to learn in contexts that are meaningful for us personality</li>
<li>learn collocations in groups to help us fix them in our memory. We might group together collocations relating to the same topic. Or we might group collocations based on the same word, for example:</li>
</ul>
<p>I must <strong>find a way</strong> to help him.</p>
<p>Can you <strong>find your way</strong> back to my house?</p>
<p>I <strong>learnt the hard way</strong> that Jack can’t be trusted.</p>
<p>Please tell me if I’m <strong>getting in your way</strong>.</p>
<p>You must <strong>give way to</strong> traffic from the left.</p>
<p>I’ve <strong>tried every possible way</strong> to get him to change his mind.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: I wouldn’t worry. They’ll probably start you as a receptionist, or something like that. So what’s important for that kind of job isn’t so much having business skills or knowing lots of different computer systems – it’s communication (Q3) that really matters – so you’d be fine there.</p>
<p>💡 Why?</p>
<p>William contrasts what is not important with what is important. Let’s break it down:</p>
<p>He says “it isn’t so much having business skills or knowing lots of different computer systems.”</p>
<p>Then he clearly emphasizes: “it’s communication that really matters.”</p>
<p>So, he’s saying communication is the most important skill for these roles — not business skills or technical computer knowledge.</p>
<p>This makes communication the correct word for Q3.</p>
<p>❗ Why it’s wrong:</p>
<p>You misunderstood the negative structure of the sentence:</p>
<p>“It isn’t so much business skills…” → means business skills are not the most important.</p>
<p>You heard “business skills” and assumed it was the answer because it sounded related.</p>
<p>You also mentioned you thought “skills” was plural, and “business” felt like a category.</p>
<p>This is a common mistake when learners miss negative contrast signals like “isn’t” or “not as important as…”</p>
<p>How to Avoid This Mistake in the Future</p>
<p>👂 Listening Tip:</p>
<p>Pay close attention to negatives and contrasts. Phrases like:</p>
<p>“It’s not so much…”</p>
<p>“The most important thing is…”</p>
<p>“More than… it’s…”</p>
<p>These show the speaker is making a comparison — the second part is usually the correct answer.</p>
<p>🧠 Practice Sentence Structures:</p>
<p>“It’s not so much X, but Y.” → Y is more important.</p>
<p>“What matters most is Y, not X.” → Again, Y is the answer.</p>

<p>Complete the sentence:</p>
<p>Company provides a __________ for local transport and heritage sites.</p>
<p>🔍 Transcript Focus – Q18 Section:</p>
<p>“Day four is free for you to explore, using the <strong>pass</strong> which we’ll give you. So you won’t have to pay for travel on local transport, or for entrance to the island’s heritage sites.”</p>
<p>✅ Correct Answer: pass</p>
<p>💡 Why?</p>
<p>The speaker clearly says they will give you a pass.</p>
<p>The pass allows you to:</p>
<p>Use local transport</p>
<p>Enter heritage sites for free</p>
<p>So the thing the company provides is a pass — not the entrance itself. The entrance is free, but only because of the pass.</p>
<p>❌ Your Answer: entrance</p>
<p>❗ Why It’s Incorrect:</p>
<p>You probably focused on the phrase: “entrance to the island’s heritage sites” and assumed that was the answer.</p>
<p>However, “entrance” is not what is being provided.</p>
<p>Instead, the company provides a “pass”, and that pass grants you free entrance.</p>
<p>So, this is a case of not following the logic of the sentence:</p>
<p>What is provided? → a pass</p>
<p>What does it allow? → free entrance</p>

<p>❌ Question 21:</p>
<p>What personality trait is associated with the eldest child?</p>
<p>Your answer: H – competitive</p>
<p>Correct answer: G – caring</p>
<p>🔍 Transcript says:</p>
<p>“Some studies claimed that they were thought to be good at nurturing – certainly in the past when people had large families they would have been expected to look after the younger ones.”</p>
<p>✅ Why G is correct:</p>
<p>Nurturing directly matches G: caring</p>
<p>This was a positive trait assigned to eldest children in older, larger families</p>
<p>❌ Why H (competitive) is wrong:</p>
<p>Nowhere in the transcript is competitiveness mentioned regarding eldest children.</p>
<p>❌ Question 22:</p>
<p>What personality trait is associated with a middle child?</p>
<p>Your answer: G – caring</p>
<p>Correct answer: F – co-operative</p>
<p>🔍 Transcript says:</p>
<p>“One trait that a lot of the studies mention is that they are easier to get on with… Generally eager to please and helpful.”</p>
<p>✅ Why F is correct:</p>
<p>“Easier to get on with,” “eager to please,” and “helpful” all suggest co-operative</p>
<p>❌ Why G (caring) is wrong:</p>
<p>While being “helpful” and “eager to please” might sound like “caring,” the word “co-operative” better captures the idea of getting along well with others, which is what the transcript emphasizes.</p>
<p>❌ Question 25:</p>
<p>What personality trait is associated with an only child?</p>
<p>Your answer: D – attention-seeking</p>
<p>Correct answer: B – selfish</p>
<p>🔍 Transcript says:</p>
<p>“Only children have had a really bad press – a lot of studies have branded them as loners who think the world revolves around them because they’ve never had to fight for their parents’ attention.”</p>
<p>✅ Why B is correct:</p>
<p>Thinking “the world revolves around them” matches the idea of selfishness</p>
<p>❌ Why D (attention-seeking) is wrong:</p>
<p>The phrase “never had to fight for attention” implies they don’t need to seek attention — they already have it.</p>
<p>❌ Question 30:</p>
<p>Which experience of sibling rivalry do both speakers agree was valuable?</p>
<p>Your answer: A – learning to share</p>
<p>Correct answers: B – learning to stand up for oneself, D – learning to be tolerant</p>
<p>🔍 Transcript says:</p>
<p>Ruth: “My younger brother was incredibly annoying… but I think this has made me a stronger person. I know how to defend myself.”</p>
<p>“…we had to put up with each other” → shows tolerance</p>
<p>Ed: “Yes, my situation was pretty similar.”</p>
<p>✅ Why B and D are correct:</p>
<p>B: stand up for oneself → matches “defend myself”</p>
<p>D: be tolerant → matches “put up with each other”</p>
<p>❌ Why A (learning to share) is wrong:</p>
<p>Ed specifically says:</p>
<p>“I was never prepared to let my brothers use any of my stuff.”</p>
<p>So they did NOT learn to share!</p>
<p>🎯 How to Improve:</p>
<p>✅ 1. Match Meaning, Not Just Keywords</p>
<p>Don’t just pick a word that sounds vaguely related — match the intent and meaning, especially when traits are described using different language.</p>
<p>✅ 2. Watch for Negative Statements</p>
<p>“Never had to fight for attention” ≠ “attention-seeking”</p>
<p>Pay attention to what the speaker is contrasting or rejecting</p>
<p>✅ 3. Use Process of Elimination</p>
<p>For each trait option, ask: “Was this clearly supported?” Eliminate ones with no textual evidence.</p>

<p>Mundulla Yellows – Cause: lime used for making __________ was absorbed</p>
<p>🔍 Relevant Transcript Segment:</p>
<p>“It wasn’t until 2004 that they found the cause of the problem was lime, or calcium hydroxide to give it its proper chemical name, which was being used in the construction of roads. The lime was being washed away into the ground and affecting the roots of the eucalyptus trees nearby.”</p>
<p>✅ Correct Answer: roads</p>
<p>💡 Why?</p>
<p>The lime (calcium hydroxide) was used in building roads.</p>
<p>It affected the soil and caused the eucalyptus trees to suffer because it interfered with iron absorption.</p>
<p>So the missing word is “roads”, as the construction of roads was the source of the lime contamination.</p>
<p>❌ Your Answer: “roast”</p>
<p>❗ Why It’s Incorrect:</p>
<p>Likely due to a listening error caused by fast speech or unfamiliar pronunciation.</p>
<p>The word “roads” may have sounded like “roast” because:</p>
<p>The /d/ sound in “roads” is soft and might blend with other words.</p>
<p>You may not have expected “roads” to be related to eucalyptus trees, so you misinterpreted the context.</p>
<p>“Roast” doesn’t logically fit here — it has no connection to lime or tree health.</p>
<p>🔁 IELTS Listening Strategy: How to Avoid This Mistake</p>
<p>👂 1. Use Context to Predict Answers</p>
<p>Before listening, read the sentence:</p>
<p>“Lime used for making ________ was absorbed…”</p>
<p>Lime is commonly used in construction, so possible logical answers include roads, buildings, etc.</p>
<p>“Roast” doesn’t fit this context. Always cross-check with logic.</p>
<p>✍️ 2. Note Word Relationships</p>
<p>The phrase “used for making roads” is collocated (words that commonly go together).</p>
<p>Learn common collocations like:</p>
<p>build/make roads, bridges, buildings</p>
<p>roast meat, coffee, etc.</p>
<p>🎧 3. Practice with Accents</p>
<p>Native speakers may pronounce “roads” quickly: /rəʊdz/ – especially in Australian/British accents.</p>
<p>Practice listening to Australian speakers to get used to this rhythm and pronunciation.</p>

<p>I come from a small family - it’s just me and my younger sibling. Since there are only two of us, we’ve always been quite close, although of course we had our share of sibling rivalry growing up.</p>

<p>I’m the oldest child, and that often came with extra responsibilities. For example, I was expected to set a good example and sometimes even help take care of my younger sibling. That definitely influenced how I developed certain traits like being more disciplined and organized.</p>
</section>
<section id="do-you-think-your-personality-has-been-affected-by-your-birth-order" class="level3" data-number="7.1.3">
<h3 data-number="7.1.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="do-you-think-your-personality-has-been-affected-by-your-birth-order"><span class="header-section-number">7.1.3</span> Do you think your personality has been affected by your birth order?</h3>
<p>Yes, I think so. As the eldest, I felt a certain pressure to be mature and dependable. I’ve always bene quite dominant in group settings, and I think that’s partly because I got used to being in charge at home. At the same time, I believe it made me more protective and nurturing as an older brother,.</p>
<p>Part 2: Cue Card Sample Answer (Oldest Child, One Sibling)</p>
<p>Describe how your position in the family may have influenced your personality.</p>
<p>You should say:</p>
<p>What your position in the family is</p>
<p>What traits are associated with this position</p>
<p>Whether you agree with them</p>
<p>And explain how this may have affected your relationships</p>
<p>Sample Answer:</p>
<p>I’m the oldest of two children — I have a younger sibling. In many families, the eldest child is expected to be responsible, organised, and a bit more mature than the others. I’d say those traits do describe me fairly well. From an early age, I felt a sense of responsibility, especially when it came to setting an example or helping out around the house.</p>
<p>One stereotype about eldest children is that they tend to be dominant or even bossy. While I try not to be overbearing, I do like being in control of situations, especially in group work or decision-making. So in that sense, I guess the stereotype fits a little.</p>
<p>Being the older sibling has definitely influenced my relationships, both within and outside the family. With my sibling, I’ve often taken on a protective role — sometimes maybe too much. In friendships, I tend to be quite dependable and often take initiative, perhaps because I’m used to leading.</p>
<p>Overall, I believe that being the oldest has shaped my confidence and helped me develop strong interpersonal skills. It has its challenges, but it’s also given me a sense of purpose and direction.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Do you think birth order really influences a person’s personality?</li>
</ol>
<p>Sample Answer:</p>
<p>To some extent, yes. There’s empirical evidence suggesting that the eldest child tends to be more dominant and responsible, while the youngest might be more attention-seeking. However, I think environment and parenting styles are also major factors, so it’s not entirely about birth order.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Why do some people reject these birth order theories?</li>
</ol>
<p>Sample Answer:</p>
<p>Some argue that these theories are based on stereotypes rather than consistent data. In fact, people often don’t fit neatly into these categories. For instance, an only child might be seen as self-centred, but that doesn’t apply to everyone. Personality is shaped by many variables, not just the order in which someone is born.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>How can sibling rivalry impact a child’s development?</li>
</ol>
<p>Sample Answer:</p>
<p>Sibling rivalry can have both negative and positive effects. On the downside, it may lead to long-term resentment if not managed properly. But on the upside, it can help children learn to stand up for themselves, negotiate, and even verbalise their feelings more effectively.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Are families today different in how they affect personality compared to the past?</li>
</ol>
<p>Sample Answer:</p>
<p>Definitely. Modern families tend to be smaller, and parenting is more focused on emotional well-being. In the past, eldest children often had to take on more responsibility, especially in large families. Now, the distribution of roles is more balanced, which may lead to less rigid personality traits based on birth order.</p>

<td>This was a <strong>plural mistake</strong>. The speaker said: “… one of the <strong>clubs</strong> in the area — there are a great many to choose from.” The word “many” confirms it’s plural.</td>
<td>🔄 <strong>Strategy</strong>: Always check if they mention <strong>numbers</strong> or words like <em>“many,” “a few,” “several”</em>, which mean the answer should be <strong>plural</strong>.</td>

<p>You got A (decorating) correct – mentioned as: “do some painting or wallpapering.”</p>
<p>You chose D (shopping) — not quite correct. Shopping is suggested in the line:</p>
<p>“…recommend how to plan their budget or how to shop sensibly…”</p>
<p>But that’s only giving advice, not actually shopping.</p>
<p>You missed E (childcare) — mentioned as:</p>
<p>“…do some babysitting so that parents can go out…”</p>
<p>This is direct childcare.</p>

<p>🔹 Q15: Habib → F (Remember past times)</p>
<p>You chose A: Overcome physical difficulties — which is not the case. It was about music triggering memories, not about any physical help.</p>
<p>✅ What to listen for:</p>
<p>“Songs take them back to their youth” → keyword: “remember”, not “recover physically”</p>
<p>🔹 Q16: Consuela → A (Overcome physical difficulties)</p>
<p>You chose B: Rediscover skills not used — but she wasn’t helping them recover a skill like cooking or crafting.</p>
<p>Instead, it was walking — she inspires mobility by example.</p>

<p>Tips to Fix These Mistakes</p>
<p>🔹 Q21 – Mishearing Numbers</p>
<p>Practice listening to quantities with context, especially when they contrast past and present:</p>
<p>“I used to teach bands of 20, this one has about 50.”</p>
<p>✅ Fix: Pause &amp; mentally label the number with “current size”.</p>
<p>🔹 Q22 – Trap Words</p>
<p>This is a classic IELTS trick: mention a wrong option first (national), then correct it (regional).</p>
<p>“Not national… but regional.”</p>
<p>✅ Fix: Focus on what they finally decide, not the first idea.</p>
<p>🔹 Q24 – Drummer vs Drama</p>
<p>“Drummer” and “Drama” are close in sound, but context helps:</p>
<p>“…playing in a band changed his life” → clearly a musician, not an actor.</p>
<p>✅ Fix: Listen for context clues. Ask: who is talking, what’s the story about?</p>

<p>Question 32</p>
<p>You wrote: VIBRANT</p>
<p>Correct answer: ENERGY</p>
<p>Transcript:</p>
<p>“Liza Lim’s compositions are vibrant and full of energy…”</p>
<p>Why this is wrong:</p>
<p>The question says:</p>
<p>“compositions show a great deal of _____”</p>
<p>→ So you need a noun that matches “a great deal of”.</p>
<p>“A great deal of” cannot be followed by adjectives like “vibrant”.</p>
<p>“Vibrant” describes the style, but the answer must be a specific noun, and that noun is “energy”.</p>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<ul>
<li><p>Pay close attention to grammatical structures in the question.</p></li>
<li><p>Look for exact matches between the question’s collocations (like “a great deal of”) and the noun in the audio.</p></li>
<li><p>Words near the answer (like “vibrant”) can mislead you — IELTS often puts distractors nearby to test your focus on function, not just vocabulary.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>Question 40</p>
<p>You wrote: OLYMPIC</p>
<p>Correct answer: OLYMPICS</p>
<p>Transcript:</p>
<p>“…his music for the flag hand-over ceremony of the Olympics held in 1996.”</p>
<p>Why this is wrong:</p>
<p>The word “Olympic” is an adjective (e.g.&nbsp;Olympic Games, Olympic athlete).</p>
<p>The blank in the sentence requires a noun to complete the phrase:</p>
<p>“festival will include his music for the 1996 ________”</p>
<p>So the correct noun is Olympics, referring to the global sports event.</p>
<p>Tip:</p>
<p>Always match the word form (noun/verb/adjective) to the grammar of the sentence.</p>
<p>Listen for plural endings — “Olympics” is clearly plural in pronunciation.</p>
<p>Review common proper nouns and event names like “the Olympics”, “the World Cup”, etc.</p>

  <title>IELTS Listening: Note-Taking Strategy (IDP-Style, Real Test Method)</title>
  <dc:creator>Hung </dc:creator>
  <link>https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/take-note-in-listening/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<section id="why-it-matters" class="level1" data-number="1">
<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Why it Matters</h1>
<p>The IELTS Listening test does not give you a second chance — you hear it once only. Effective note-taking bridges the gap between what you hear and what you need to write, especially when:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The answer is paraphrased</p></li>
<li><p>You forget a detail by the time you get to the gap</p></li>
<li><p>You need to choose from multiple options</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="full-step-by-step-method-for-real-test-use" class="level1" data-number="2">
<h1 data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Full Step-by-Step Method: For Real Test Use</h1>
<section id="before-recording-starts" class="level2" data-number="2.1">
<h2 data-number="2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="before-recording-starts"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Before Recording Starts</h2>
<p>Step 1: Underline Keywords</p>
<ul>
<li>Read all questions in the section (you have 30-60 seconds).</li>
<li>Underline 1 - 2 key words in each question:
<ul>
<li>Nouns, numbers, verbs</li>
<li>Signal words like “before”, “after”, “because”, “although”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>✅ Example:</p>
<p>Q11: The band has approximately ___ members.</p>
<p>→ underline: band, approximately, members</p>
</section>
<section id="while-listening" class="level2" data-number="2.2">
<h2 data-number="2.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="while-listening"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> While Listening</h2>
<p>Step 2: Takes Notes Quickly</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Don’t write full sentences. Use:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Abbreviations: e.g.&nbsp;“gov” = government, “↓” = decrease</p></li>
<li><p>Symbols: e.g.&nbsp;→ (cause), ~ (related), ≠ (opposite)</p></li>
<li><p>Short forms: “env. prob.” = environmental problem</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>✅ Use These Formats:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mind-map style: great for summaries or processes</p></li>
<li><p>Columns: ideal for conversations (e.g.&nbsp;Speaker A | Speaker B)</p></li>
<li><p>Numbered list: good for lectures or instructions</p></li>
</ul>
<p>✅ Key Focus:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Listen for paraphrasing (not exact match)</p></li>
<li><p>Pay attention to signpost words:</p></li>
<li><p>“Next,” “Then,” “However,” “In contrast,” “Finally”</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 data-number="2.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="after-the-recording"><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> After the Recording</h2>
<p>Step 3: Transfer Notes to Answers</p>
<p>Use the 30 seconds after each part to:</p>
<p>Read back your notes</p>
<p>Match meaning, not just words</p>
<p>Confirm singular/plural, spelling, grammar</p>
<p>Eliminate distractors if it’s multiple choice</p>

  <title>A One-sentence Argument</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<section id="one-conclusion-or-many-conclusions" class="level1" data-number="1">
<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> One conclusion or many conclusions?</h1>
<p>A typical IELTS essay consists of an <strong>introduction</strong>, <strong>several body paragraphs</strong>, and a <strong>conclusion</strong>. The final conclusion at the end of the essay summarises your <strong>overall argument</strong> and <strong>final position</strong>, thus completing the essay.</p>
<p>However, the <strong>body paragraphs</strong> of your essay also include a different kind of <strong>conclusion</strong>.</p>
<section id="understanding-the-word-argument" class="level2" data-number="1.1">
<h2 data-number="1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="understanding-the-word-argument"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Understanding the Word “Argument”</h2>
<p>An <strong>argument</strong> is defined as a <strong>reason (or set of reasons)</strong> given in support of an idea or position. This definition helps clarify a key concept in IELTS writing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your essay should present <strong>one overall argument</strong></li>
<li>This overall argument is made up of <strong>several shorter arguments</strong> (also known as <strong>main ideas</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these shorter arguments should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clearly explained</li>
<li>Well-organised</li>
<li>Logically linked to the rest of the essay</li>
</ul>
<p>Together, these create <strong>unity and coherence</strong>.</p>
<p>If any of your main ideas are unclear or weak, it affects:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>progression</strong> of your essay</li>
<li>The <strong>clarity</strong> of your position</li>
<li>Your score in <strong>Coherence and Cohesion</strong> and <strong>Task Response</strong></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="main-ideas-as-arguments-and-conclusions" class="level2" data-number="1.2">
<h2 data-number="1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="main-ideas-as-arguments-and-conclusions"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Main Ideas as Arguments and Conclusions</h2>
<p>Each <strong>main idea</strong> in your body paragraphs should be structured as an <strong>argument</strong>. This means it should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Present a <strong>conclusion</strong> (what you believe)</li>
<li>Provide a <strong>reason</strong> (why you believe it)</li>
</ul>
<p>This structure is often seen in the <strong>first and last sentences</strong> of a paragraph, but it can appear in other forms as well. Whenever you state your opinion or present a point, you are effectively <strong>making an argument</strong> and offering a <strong>conclusion</strong>.</p>
<p>This is directly connected to the <strong>Task Response</strong> criterion in the IELTS Band Descriptors. For example:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Band 6: “The conclusions may become unclear.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This happens when the points in your body paragraphs are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not well supported</li>
<li>Poorly explained</li>
<li>Disconnected from the overall argument</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="key-idea" class="level2" data-number="1.3">
<h2 data-number="1.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-idea"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Key Idea</h2>
<p>An <strong>argument</strong> is a <strong>statement provided as evidence</strong> to show that another statement — the <strong>conclusion</strong> — is true. The <strong>main ideas</strong> or <strong>points</strong> in your body paragraphs should always be structured this way to form a strong, logical essay.</p>
<p>In later lessons, these paragraph-level arguments will be referred to as <strong>points</strong> or <strong>main ideas</strong>, but it’s important to understand that each one must function as an argument: a reasoned statement that leads to a clear conclusion.</p>
</section>
<section id="a-one-sentence-argument" class="level2" data-number="1.4">
<h2 data-number="1.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-one-sentence-argument"><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> A one-sentence argument</h2>
<p>Although our main ideas will generally be explained over several sentences within a paragraph, we’ll begin by looking at a simple one-sentence argument:</p>
<p><em>Fruit contains vitamin C, which helps keep us healthy, so the government should encourage everyone to eat more fruit.</em></p>
<p>To demonstrate that this is an argument, we can seperate it into a conclusion and the reasons given for believing it.</p>
<div class="callout callout-style-default callout-note callout-titled">
<div class="callout-header d-flex align-content-center">
<div class="callout-icon-container">
<i class="callout-icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="callout-title-container flex-fill">
Note
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Conclusion: The government should encourage everyone to eat more fruit.</p>
<p>Reason 1) fruit contains vitamin C</p>
<p>Reason 2) vitamin C helps to keep us healthy</p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<section id="point-to-notice" class="level2" data-number="1.5">
<h2 data-number="1.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="point-to-notice"><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> Point to notice:</h2>
<p>1 The conclusion does not always come after the reasons. This means that we can also write:</p>
<p><em>The government should encourage everyone to eat more fruit because it contains vitamin C, which is good for health.</em></p>
<p>Even though the order has changed, the conclusion remains the same: the government should encourage everyone to eat more fruit.</p>
<p>2 Each reason in this argument is called a ‘<strong>premise</strong>’, which means a claim being made by the writer. The writer is asking the reader to accept these claims (that fruit contains vitamin C, and vitamin C helps keep us healthy) are true, and that they are good enough reasons to conclude that the government should encourage everyone to eat more fruit. When we are writing, we need to make sure that our claims are true (or at least believable), and that they know the reader that our conclusions are reasonable.</p>
<p>3 We are giving our position every time we make an argument like this one. This mean that we do not need to write <em>I believe; I think; In my view</em> to make our position clear; whether our position remains clear or not will depend on the language we use, and the reasons we provide to support it. Even more importantly, simply writing <em>In my view</em> at the beginning and end of our essay, and within our body paragraphs, is not enough to make our position clear throughout. Only the language and reasoning in our argument can do that.</p>

<h1 data-number="3"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> IELTS Writing: Reasoning Problems in Argument Structure</h1>
<p>In IELTS essays, an argument or idea can remain <strong>unclear</strong> even if the <strong>language used is accurate</strong>. This happens when the <strong>reasoning</strong> behind the idea is weak or confusing.</p>
<p>In fact, a large portion of <strong>band 6 writing</strong> contains <strong>unclear or invalid arguments</strong>, rather than language errors. Understanding how to structure logical and persuasive reasoning is essential for higher scores.</p>

<h3 data-number="3.1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="making-a-point-without-a-reason"><span class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> 1. Making a Point Without a Reason</h3>
<p>Stating a conclusion without explaining why you believe it leads to weak writing.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> &gt; The government should encourage everyone to eat more fruit.</p>
<p>This is a conclusion, but it lacks a reason. The reader is left wondering: - Why should the government do this? - What benefit does this have?</p>

<p>Sometimes a writer includes a reason or example, but it does not <strong>logically support</strong> the conclusion.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> &gt; The government should encourage everyone to eat more fruit.<br>
&gt; For example, a BBC documentary showed that 85% of people eat fruit.</p>
<p>This fact (even if true) <strong>does not explain</strong> or <strong>support</strong> the conclusion. It fails to show <strong>why</strong> the government should promote fruit consumption. In many cases, the example is also <strong>clearly invented</strong> and adds confusion instead of clarity.</p>
<p>These types of errors are <strong>very common</strong> in student essays and are a key reason for a <strong>band 6 score in Task Response</strong>.</p>

<h2 data-number="3.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-makes-an-argument-clear-and-valid"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> What Makes an Argument Clear and Valid</h2>
<p>In a <strong>clear, valid argument</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>reason is directly related</strong> to the conclusion.</li>
<li>The <strong>example or evidence</strong> helps to explain <strong>why the conclusion is correct</strong>.</li>
<li>The reader is persuaded because the logic is sound.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Strong Example:</strong> &gt; The government should encourage everyone to eat more fruit<br>
&gt; because increased fruit consumption can reduce national healthcare costs by lowering the rates of heart disease and diabetes.</p>
<p>Here, the <strong>reason logically supports</strong> the conclusion. The reader understands <strong>why</strong> the statement is made and can follow the writer’s reasoning.</p>

<li><p>In&nbsp;<strong>IELTS Writing Task 2</strong>, use&nbsp;<strong>formal collocations</strong>&nbsp;for precision and sophistication:</p>

<p>When I left university I <strong>made a decision</strong> to take up a profession in which I could be creative. I could play the guitar, but I’d never written any songs. Nonetheless, I decided to become a singer-songwriter. I made some recordings but I had a <strong>rather heavy cold</strong>, so they didn’t <strong>sound good</strong>. I made some more, and sent them to a <strong>record company</strong> and waited for them to reply. So, while I was waiting to become famous, I got a job in a <strong>fastfood</strong> restaurant. That was five years ago. I’m still doing the same job.</p>

<p>If we use a plural noun, we must use a plural verb. The verb must ‘agree’ with the noun:</p>

<p><em>I like studying during the day but <strong>my friend prefers</strong> studying at night.</em> (singular noun + singular verb)</p>
<p>We use a plural noun with: - plural verbs: <em>are, were, have, do, play, etc.</em>: There are a lot of books on the table. - numbers greater than one: 30 cars, 100 students - <em>many</em>: It is annoying that so <strong>many buses drive</strong> fast because they <strong>are</strong> full. - <em>the number of</em>: <strong>The number of buses</strong> on our roads <strong>has</strong> increased each year.</p>

<p>Some nouns in English are ‘uncountable’. This means they do not have a plural form. Some common uncountable nouns are: <em>advice, advertising, food, furniture, garbage, information, knowledge, money, shopping, time, traffic, travel</em></p>
<p>With uncountable nouns, you must see:</p>
<ul>
<li>the singular form: <em>food, information, money</em></li>
<li><em>a little / amount of / much / some</em>: How <font color="#00b050">much money</font> do you have? The <font color="#00b050">amount of traffic</font> on the roads is increasing each year.</li>
<li>a singular verb: There <font color="#00b050">was</font> already a little <font color="#00b050">furniture</font> in the flat.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a noun is uncountable, you cannot use:</p>
<ul>
<li>a plural form: ~~advices, furnitures, garbages, informations, knowledges ~~</li>
<li>a/an: <del>an advice, a garbage, a knowledge</del></li>
<li>a few / many / number of: <del>a few shopping, many traffie, the number of knowledge</del></li>
<li>a number: <del>three travels, four furniture</del></li>
<li>a plural verb: <del>There were a little furniture in the flat.</del></li>
</ul>
<p>If we want to add a number to an uncountable noun, we can use <em>a piece of / some / a few pieces of</em>: <font color="#00b050">a piece of advice, three pieces of furniture, a few pieces of garbage</font></p>

  <title>Academic discussion: Lead-in phrases</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Many lead-in phrases are used to structure academic discussion: to introduce ideas cautiously, challenge ideas, invite opinions, etc. Some of these make use of reporting structures.</p>
<section id="reporting-structures-to-introduce-ideas-cautiously-and-challenge-ideas" class="level1" data-number="1">
<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Reporting structures to introduce ideas cautiously and challenge ideas</h1>
<p>In academic discussion we tend to introduce an idea or opinion cautiously, as it often just one point of view, not an objective fact. One way to do this to preface the idea with a reporting clause. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>I should/ would think that</strong> we’ll still be using fossil fuels in 20 years time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>I shoundn’t/ wouldn’t think that</strong> anyone would object to the decision.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Even more cautiously we can use <strong>I should(n’t)/ would(n’t) have thought that</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>I should/ would have thought that</strong> there wouldn’t be any danger to animals. Or</p>
<p><strong>I shouldn’t/ wouldn’t have thought that</strong> there would be any danger to animals.</p>
<p>Note that we avoid using two negatives. (<em>not</em> I wouldn’t/ shouldn’t have thought there wouldn’t be any danger to animals.)</p>
<p>In some contexts we can use the same patterns to politely challenge what another speaker has said:</p>
<p>A: I’ll be targeting 40 to 60 year olds in the experiment.</p>
<p>B: Well, <strong>I shouldn’t have thought</strong> the age of the subjects would make any difference. (= I don’t think that)</p>
</section>
<section id="reporting-structures-to-invite-opinions" class="level1" data-number="2">
<h1 data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Reporting structures to invite opinions</h1>
<p>One way to invite another speaker to present an idea or opinion or to expand on one already presented is by using a <strong>wh-clause</strong> with certain reporting verbs:</p>
<p>A: The results show a preference for self-service over personal service in stories.</p>
<p>B: <strong>Why do you think (that)</strong> self-services is so popular?</p>
<p>A: I’ll live stream the lecture to students off campus. B: <strong>Where do you intend to</strong> position the camera?</p>

</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Other verbs used in this way include: <strong>anticipate, feel, imagine, reckon, recommend, suggest, suppose</strong> (may be followed by <em>that</em>); <strong>consider, expect, propose, want</strong> (usually followed by a <em>to</em>-infinitive)</p>

<h1 data-number="3"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Other lead-in phrases</h1>
<p>Many other lead-in phrases are used to structure academic discussion:</p>
<p>A: <strong>In a way</strong>, the Internet has completely changed the way we communicate. (reducing the force of the statement)</p>
<p>B: <strong>So you mean</strong> that it has improved communication? (asking for clarification)</p>
<p>A: Not necessarily, no. <strong>What I’m saying is</strong> that … (clarifying an opinion)</p>

<p>Ana: I’ve been doing some reading on this. (1) As far as I can see, NASA plan to prioritize crewed rather than robotic missions, and I think that’s right. Humans can respond to problems in a way that computers never can. Take Apollo 13, for instace.</p>
<p>Beto: (2) I take your point, but robotic missions can go on for years in a way that crewed missions can’t.</p>
<p>Carla: Yes, I agree. There are so many disadvantages of a crewed over a robotic mission. (3) For one thing, it’s so much more expensive, and then there’s the risk the lives of the astronauts.</p>
<p>Ana: (4) So what you’re saying is that we should never send people into space?</p>
<p>Beto: No.&nbsp;(5) What I mean is that it’s a better use of money - and much safer - to use robotic missions. (6) That’s not to say that a robotic mission can do everything a crewed mission can, but robotic missions should take priority.</p>
<p>Dan: (7) To be honest, I’ve no idea which is better. There are so many pros and cons of each.</p>

  <title>Referring to other work and sections in academic writing and speaking</title>

<section id="referring-to-other-work-as-passive-past-participle" class="level1" data-number="1">
<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Referring to other work: as + passive / past participle</h1>
<p>In academic writing and speaking we can make references to other people’s work using a clause with <strong>as + passive</strong></p>
<p>The first approach should be discarded as it makes wrong predictions about word order, <strong>as is argued</strong> in Frascarelli and Hinter (2007).</p>
<p>Past usage experience had a major impact on consumer decision behaviour, <strong>as has been shown</strong> in a number of recent studies.</p>

</div>
<div class="callout-title-container flex-fill">
Tip
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Note that we don’t use <em>it</em> in this type of clause. (<em>not</em> … as it is argued by … <em>or</em> as it has been shown …)</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>More commonly we use a reduced passive form - <strong>as + past participle</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>As noted</strong> by Kerr (2004) these figures were a significant underestimate.</p>
<p>Both temperature and moisture were important in explaining the abundance of fungi, <strong>as demonstrated</strong> in previous studies (e.g.&nbsp;Lam, 2002; Rich at al., 2014)</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p><em>Also:</em> __as + argued, described, discussed, illustrated, indicated, mentioned, pointed out, shown, suggested_</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Using a passive or reduced passive to refer to the work of others often indicates, in an impersonal way, that we agree with them:</p>
<ul>
<li>The basic communicative goal of scientific research articles, <strong>as suggested by Bird (2009)</strong>, is to convey the results of scientific inquiry.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using an active verb is more neutral and may be followed either by agreement or disagreement:</p>

<h1 data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Referring to other parts of a written text: as + past participle</h1>
<p><strong>As + past participle</strong> is also commonly used by writers to refer to tables and figures in their own texts, and is referred to more personal forms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>As (is) seen in the following chart</strong>, interest rates are lower now than in the last 30 years. (<em>rather than</em> As you see in the following chart …)</li>
<li>During her first 32 weeks of talking, Keren acquired 337 words, <strong>as shown in Figure 2-2</strong>.</li>

</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p><em>Also:</em> <strong>demonstrated, depicted, described, discussed, explained, given, illustrated, indicated, outlined</strong></p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>As + past participle</strong> is also used to refer to other sections of a text with adverbs such as <strong>above</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>As discussed above</strong>, exploration of the Moon will provide insights into the formation of the Solar System</p>

<h1 data-number="3"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Referring to other parts of a spoken presentation</h1>
<p>When we refer to other parts of a presentation we are giving, we tend to use time adverbs, not location adverbs:</p>
<ul>
<li>As I said <strong>before</strong>, … (<em>not</em> As I said above …)</li>
<li>… as I’ll come back to <strong>later on</strong>. (<em>not</em> … as I’ll come back to below)</li>
</ul>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div class="">
<p><em>Also:</em> <strong>already, earlier, previous; next</strong></p>
</div></div><p>Other grammatical structures commonly used in referring backwards and forwards in spoken presentations include <strong>what-clauses</strong> and <strong>-ing-clauses</strong>. Examples are highlighted in these extracts from a presentation:</p>
<p><strong>Coming back to the earliest development of language</strong>, it’s been estimated that it originated around 40,000 years ago … <strong>What I want to go on to next</strong> is the development of written language … Language gave people the ability to think and plan, <strong>as I pointed out previously … Returning to my point about</strong> the development of written language … <strong>What we’ll do next weeks is</strong> begin to look at non-verbal communication…</p>

<p>Reflection: Look at an example of your own academic writing. Where you have referred to other work or other parts of your text, have you used an as + past participle or as + passive form? If not, can you express yourself better by using one?</p>

  <title>Linking ideas in academic writing and speech</title>

<section id="a" class="level1" data-number="1">
<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> A</h1>
<p><em>Sentence connectors, conjunctions</em> and <em>pro-forms</em> are used to link ideas in academic writing and speaking in a number of ways.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Sentence connectors</em> link sentences. There is usually a full stop at the end of the first sentence, and the sentence connector often comes at the start of the next.</li>
<li><em>Conjunctions</em> link clauses within sentences. A comma often separates the clauses. Most conjunctions come at the start of their clause.</li>
<li><em>Pro-forms</em> are general words or phrases that refer back to more specific words or phrases, avoiding repetition.</li>

<p><strong>In sum</strong><sup>1</sup>, temperature is an important factor determining the shelf life of a food product <strong>in that</strong><sup>2</sup> variations in temperature can result in the growth of microorganisms which can cause the product the spoil. <strong>Furthermore</strong><sup>3</sup>, incorrect freezing can damage the proteins of meat or other products. <strong>Given that</strong><sup>4</sup> the maintenance of the correct temperature over a long period is essential, it is necessary to use time temperature indicators. Studies have shown that these indicators reduce food waste considerably. <strong>As well</strong><sup>5</sup>, they reduce the number of foodborne illnesses.</p>
<p>Sociology researchers use two types of information: primary data and secondary data. <strong>The former</strong><sup>6</sup> is collected by the researcher themselves, <strong>whereas</strong><sup>7</sup> secondary data already exists in some form, such as documents or previous research. Collecting primary data can be time-consuming and expensive, and <strong>as such</strong><sup>8</sup>, undergraduate researchers often prefer to use secondary data.</p>

<p>‘Biodiversity’ is the abbreviated word for ‘biological diversity’. <strong>The latter</strong> -&gt; <font color="#00b050">The last / the second</font> term appears to have come into use in the early 1980s, when Bruce Wilcox defined it <strong>as follows</strong>-&gt; <font color="#00b050">in this way/ like this</font>: “the variety of life forms … at all levels of biological systems - molecular, organismic, population species and ecosystem”. <strong>Hitherto</strong> -&gt; <font color="#00b050">Before this/ that</font>, the terms ‘species diversity’ or ‘species richness’ were used. So the term ‘biological diversity’ - <strong>subsequently</strong>-&gt; <font color="#00b050">after that</font> ‘biodiversity’ is relatively new. <strong>That said</strong> -&gt; Having said that, philosophers and scientists have studied many aspects of biodiversity over hundreds of years. Even Aristotle, working nearly two and a half thousand years ago, studied biodiversity <strong>in that</strong>-&gt; <font color="#00b050">because</font> he looked for similar patterns in organisms so that he could group them together.</p>
<p><strong>Also and Further</strong>:</p>
<p>“Also” = addition of a related fact or statistic</p>
<p>It’s used here to add another data point about the same group (those who skipped breakfast).</p>
<p>It shows that skipping lunch is an additional behaviour from the same participants.</p>
<p>“Also, 15% of these…” = In addition to skipping breakfast, they also skipped lunch.</p>
<p>❌ Why not “further”?</p>
<p>“Further” is more formal and usually used to:</p>
<p>Introduce an additional argument or point in a discussion, not another data point.</p>
<p>Often appears in Task 2 essays (not typically Task 1).</p>
<p>✅ Example of correct use of “further”:</p>
<p>Further research is needed to understand the long-term effects of this trend.</p>
<p>So in IELTS Writing Task 1, where you’re presenting facts and data, “also” is usually more appropriate for connecting related statistics.</p>

<p>‘Considering’ and ‘Bearing in mind’</p>
<p>The photographs were in superb condition, ___ they were taken over a century ago.</p>
<p>✅ Correct answer (from the book): considering</p>
<p>✅ Why “considering” is the better answer here:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Grammatical Structure – Short, Integrated Clause</li>
</ol>
<p>“Considering” can be used without “that” and still form a natural, concise clause:</p>
<p>…considering they were taken over a century ago. ✅</p>
<p>✅ This flows smoothly within the sentence.</p>
<p>“Bearing in mind” often sounds heavier, and more natural when followed by “that” or used in separate clauses:</p>
<p>…bearing in mind that they were taken…</p>
<p>✅ Correct, but wordier and less idiomatic in this kind of sentence.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Tone and Register – Concise Descriptive Language</li>
</ol>
<p>In this context, you’re describing a surprising or notable fact, and “considering” is the most natural and idiomatic choice.</p>
<p>“Bearing in mind” feels more reflective or argumentative, and is better suited for conclusions or commentary, such as:</p>
<p>Bearing in mind the results, we can conclude that…</p>
<p>✅ Used more in academic or spoken reasoning, not as clean in description.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Common Usage in Writing</li>
</ol>
<p>Native speakers and academic writers frequently use “considering” in descriptive clauses:</p>
<p>It’s surprisingly warm, considering it’s still February.</p>
<p>She did well, considering how little time she had.</p>
<p>✅ This structure is frequent and natural in written English.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<section id="expressing-opinions-impersonally" class="level1 page-columns page-full" data-number="1">
<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Expressing opinions impersonally</h1>
<p>In academic communication, we tend to be impersonal, focusing more on actions, we effects of actions, and the things affected by actions rather than the people performing the actions. We often use <em>it-</em> clauses to express opinions impersonally in academic writing and speaking. Common patterns here:</p>
<p><strong><em>it</em> + be (adverb) + adjective + <em>to-</em> infinitive</strong></p>
<p>e.g.&nbsp;<strong>It is extremely difficult to evaluate</strong> the role of tourism in urban renewal.</p>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div class="">
<p><em>Other adjectives</em> commonly used in this pattern: <strong>(in)convenient, easy, hard, important, (im)possible, interesting, (un)necessary, (un)reasonable, (in)sufficient, useful</strong></p>
</div></div><p><strong><em>it</em> + be + (adverb) + adjective + <em>that</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>It is quite possible that</strong> a larger sample size would have shown different results.</p>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div class="">
<p><em>Other adjectives</em> commonly used in this pattern: <strong>apparent, (un)clear, (in)conveivable, doubtful, essential, evident, important, (un)likely, obvious, probable, true</strong></p>
</div></div><p>Note that not all adverbs and adjectives in these patterns can combine. For example, we commonly use <strong>quite + possible/ clear</strong>, nut rarely <strong>quite + doubtful/ essential</strong></p>
<p>We often use a passive verb form in an <strong>it- clause</strong> with <strong>that</strong> when we report another person’s opinion. Notice that we usually include a reference to the other person’s work, often immediately after the reporting verb or at the end of the sentences:</p>
<p><strong>It has been reported</strong> (Crane, 2015) <strong>that</strong> prolonged periods sitting in front of a computer may have significant health risks.</p>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div class="">
<p>Verbs commonly used in this pattern:<br>
<strong>argue*</strong>, <strong>claim*</strong>, <strong>contend*</strong>, <strong>demonstrate</strong>, <strong>estimate</strong>, <strong>maintain*</strong>, <strong>note</strong>, <strong>propose*</strong>, <strong>report*</strong>, <strong>show</strong>, <strong>suggest*</strong></p>
</div></div></section>
<section id="distancing-yourself-from-a-point-of-view" class="level1" data-number="2">
<h1 data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Distancing yourself from a point of view</h1>
<p>We often use an <strong>it-clause</strong> when we want to distance ourselves from an earlier point of view, perhaps because it is now disputed, or because we feel there was some limitation or problem with the earlier work:</p>
<p><strong>It has been claimed that</strong> cheese intake is associated with high cholesterol levels (Zemel, 2001), but more recent studies have found that cheese may even have a cholesterol lowering effect (Hamedi, 2018; Allen, 2019)</p>
<p><strong>It is often suggested that</strong> air pollutants from traffic, such as nitrogen oxide (NO2) and suspended particulate matter have a negative impact on child health (e.g.&nbsp;Janssen, 2004, Knape 2012). However, relatively few studies so far have looked at the health of children living near busy roads.</p>
<p>The reporting verbs mark * in Above margin note are often used in this way.</p>
</section>
<section id="disagreeing" class="level1" data-number="3">
<h1 data-number="3"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Disagreeing</h1>
<p>In academic contexts we often begin a disagreement by acknowledging that some part of the opposing position is true. <em>Its-clauses</em> are often used for this in academic writing and also in spoken academic contexts (presentation, seminars, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>It is sometimes argued that</strong> it is important for students to outline their essays before beginning writing (e.g.&nbsp;Cotton, 2004). While <strong>it is quite correct that</strong> much of an essay can be planned in advanced, <strong>it must also be noted that</strong> the act of writing itself facilities thought and shapes ideas.</p>
<p><strong>It’s often assumed that</strong> environmental sustainability and poverty reduction can go hand-in-hand. Although <strong>it’s certainly possible to find</strong> a small number of examples where this happens, in most cases in the literature <strong>it is reported that</strong> the costs of environmental improvement fall on the poor rather than the wealthy.</p>
<p>However, in less formal spoken contexts we sometimes prefer more personal forms. For example: <strong>We often assume that …, … you can certainly find …</strong>.</p>

<section id="complex-noun-phrases" class="level1 page-columns page-full" data-number="1">
<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Complex noun phrases</h1>
<p>Long, complex noun phrases are typical of academic writing, allowing a lot of information to be included within one sentence element. They can make up <sup>1</sup> substantial parts of academic texts as subjects, objects, and complements. The complex noun phrases in this extract are in italics with the main noun in each phrase in bold.</p>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div class="">
<p><strong>🔍 “make up” (phrasal verb)</strong><br>
Means:<br>
- <strong>form</strong><br>
- <strong>constitute</strong><br>
- <strong>compose</strong></p>
<p>📘 Example meaning:<br>
&gt; Complex noun phrases <strong>make up</strong> (= form) large parts of academic writing.</p>
</div></div><p>The <strong>changes</strong> in map data collection and representation that have arisen with the introduction of computers and digital techniques are remarkable. <strong>Information</strong> that used to be collected manually from surveys and ground observations can now be collected almost instantaneously by orbiting <strong>satellites</strong> that send data to Earth at the speed of light. <strong>Maps</strong> that were once hand-drawn can now be produced on a computer and printed out in a relatively short <strong>amount</strong> of time.</p>
<p>Note the word order in complex noun phrases -</p>
<ul>
<li>The most common elements <em>before</em> the main noun in a complex noun phrase are: determiners (e.g.&nbsp;<em>a, the</em>), and adjectives (<em>e.g.&nbsp;orbiting</em>)</li>
<li>The most common elements <em>after</em> the main noun are: relative clauses (<em>e.g.: that were once hand-drawn</em>), and adjectives (<em>e.g.&nbsp;orbiting</em>)</li>
<li>After the main noun in particular, elements are often embedded within others. For example, the relative clause <em>that have arisen with the introduction of computers</em> includes the prepositional phrase <em>with the introduction of computers</em> which in turn includes the prepositional phrase of <em>computers</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In academic writing we tend to use nouns to talk about <em>actions</em> and <em>processes</em> (more typically associated with verbs), and <em>qualities</em> (more typically associated with adjectives). This use of a noun to convey a meaning usually expressed with a word from another class is referred to as <em>nominalization</em>, and this process often results in a complex noun phrase. Compare the noun phrases in these two texts:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>Organizations have reported that <strong>the number of people volunteering has decreased rapidly</strong> in recent years. At the same time, <strong>more opportunities to volunteer have become available</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>An extremely rapid decrease in volunteering</strong> has been reported in recent years. At the same time, <strong>the availability of opportunities to volunteer has increased</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Where (i) uses a verb (<em>has decreased</em>) and adjective (<em>available</em>), (ii), more typical of academic writing, uses nouns (<em>decrease, availability</em>).</p>
</section>
<section id="complex-prepositions" class="level1" data-number="2">
<h1 data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Complex prepositions</h1>
<p>Complex prepositions comprise two, three or four words. Some of these occur more frequently in academic writing than in general use. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>As for</strong> the future, demand for electricity is expected to grow at a rate of 5% per annum. (= regarding)</li>
<li>The final chapter considers inequalities in health <strong>with reference to</strong> race and gender. (= what it is about)</li>
<li>Monthly average temperatures were higher than average <strong>with the exception of</strong> June. (= not including)</li>
</ul>
<div class="collum-margin">
<p>Also: <strong>as a result of, as distinct from, as opposed to, depending on, in comparison with, in line with, in the case of, irrespective of, on the part of, prior to, regardless of</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Note that four-word prepositions usually end in <em>of</em> and include an article.</p>
<p>Complex prepositions often occur as part of complex noun phrases:</p>
<ul>
<li>This essay has discussed <em>class identity</em> <strong>with reference to</strong> <em>gender differences</em>.</li>
<li>The study found a <em>less positive attitude</em> <strong>in the case of</strong> <em>customers exposed</em> to <em>advertising and marketing communications</em>.</li>

<p>The two maps show road access before and after it was developed as a city hospital connection. Overall, most development took place on the southern and eastern sides of the hospital, where a number of transport facilities had been built, while the north side was left retained.</p>
<p>Prior to development, this area did not need to handle a crowd. In terms of its transport facilities, there was a car park, which was on the east side of hospital road, used for the public and the staff of the hospital. Besides that, there were some bus stops on both sides of the hospital road. As part of the development program, three main roads - Ring Road, which encircles the hospital, Hospital Road, and City Road had largely been retained, with some structural work fitting around existing roads.</p>
<p>Following construction, although the area was more developed, the City Hospital was unchanged. In terms of access, there were two roundabouts on both sides of Hospital Road, which connected to the Ring Road and City Road. In terms of transport facilities, while a bus station had been built for people who come to this Hospital, all bus stops had been removed. Reaching the hospital had been made easier with the addition of a public car park on the east side of the hospital; the old car park was reserved for staff.</p>

<h3 data-number="2.1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="strengths"><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> Strengths:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>You gave a clear <strong>overall summary</strong>, identifying that most development happened in the south and east.</p></li>
<li><p>You <strong>covered all key features</strong>: roads, car parks, roundabouts, bus station, and removal of bus stops.</p></li>
<li><p>The use of passive voice (<em>had been built</em>, <em>was reserved</em>) is appropriate for describing map changes.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Some factual inaccuracies and unclear phrasing reduce precision:</p></li>
<li><p>❌ “north side was left retained” → grammatically incorrect; and factually unclear. There’s no major feature on the north side of the hospital that should be described as “retained.”</p>
<p>✅ Suggestion: “…while the hospital building itself remained unchanged.”</p></li>
<li><p>❌ “three main roads… had largely been retained…” → This sentence is confusing; you listed the roads as if they were new, then said they were retained. Also, the roads weren’t developed structurally—the development was around them.</p></li>
<li><p>The task required clear before/after comparisons. Your timeline control is a bit weak in parts. For example:</p>
<p>“Following construction, although the area was more developed, the City Hospital was unchanged.”</p>
<p>✅ Better: “After redevelopment, the hospital building itself remained unchanged, while the surrounding infrastructure was significantly upgraded.”</p></li>

<p>✅ Strengths:</p>
<p>Good use of sequencing phrases: “Prior to development,” “Following construction,” “In terms of…”</p>
<p>Logical paragraph structure with clear division: before vs.&nbsp;after.</p>
<p>🔧 Areas for Improvement:</p>
<p>Some cohesion devices are misused or overused:</p>
<p>Repetition of “In terms of…” — try synonyms like “Regarding,” “With respect to,” “Concerning,” etc.</p>
<p>Sentences sometimes lack clarity due to poor syntax:</p>

<p>✅ Strengths:</p>
<p>You use some appropriate map-related vocabulary: roundabouts, bus station, hospital road, car park, retained, facilities.</p>
<p>🔧 Issues:</p>
<p>Some inaccurate or awkward word choices:</p>
<p>“the area did not need to handle a crowd”</p>
<p>✅ Better: “the area had limited traffic demand before development”</p>
<p>“used for the public and the staff of the hospital” → too wordy</p>

<p>Complex sentences attempted.</p>
<p>🔧 Issues:</p>
<p>Multiple tense control and grammar slips:</p>
<p>❌ “north side was left retained” → incorrect phrase (double passive). Should be:</p>
<p>✅ “the north side remained undeveloped” or “was left untouched”</p>
<p>❌ “come to this Hospital” → wrong register</p>
<p>✅ Use: “visit the hospital” (no capital H for “hospital” unless part of its name)</p>
<p>Use of past perfect (“had been built”) is not always necessary—present perfect or simple past may be better if it’s part of the map description.</p>

<p>The two maps show before and after road access was improved to serve the City Hospital. Overall, most development took place on the southern and eastern sides of the hospital, where a number of transport facilities had been built, while the hospital building itself remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Prior to development, the area had limited traffic demand. In terms of its transport facilities, there was a car park, which was on the east side of hospital road, used by both the public and hospital staff. Additionally, there were some bus stops on both sides of the hospital road.</p>
<p>After redevelopment, the hospital building itself remained unchanged, while the surrounding infrastructure was significantly upgraded. Regarding access, there were two roundabouts on both sides of Hospital Road, which connected to the Ring Road and City Road. Concerning access features, while a bus station had been built for hospital visitors, all bus stops had been removed. Access to the hospital was improved by the addition of a public car park on the east side of the hospital; the old car park was reserved for staff.</p>
<p>🔹 1. Task Achievement:</p>
<p>✅ What’s good:</p>
<p>You clearly identify changes between the two maps: bus station, car parks, roundabouts, etc.</p>
<p>You correctly state that the hospital building itself remained unchanged.</p>
<p>You use appropriate comparisons between before and after.</p>
<p>You included specific features with accurate location references (east side, both sides of Hospital Road, etc.)</p>
<p>🔧 To improve:</p>
<p>The phrase “developed as a city hospital connection” is a little unclear or awkward. Better phrased as:</p>
<p>✅ “…developed to improve road access to the City Hospital”</p>
<p>✅ OR: “…developed to enhance transportation infrastructure around City Hospital.”</p>
<p>🔹 2. Coherence and Cohesion:</p>
<p>✅ What’s good:</p>
<p>Paragraphs are well-organized: introduction, before, after.</p>
<p>Clear linking: “Prior to development,” “After redevelopment,” “Additionally,” “Regarding access,” “Concerning access features”.</p>
<p>🔧 Suggestions:</p>
<p>Try not to repeat phrases like “the hospital building itself remained unchanged.” You used this twice in two paragraphs. Rephrase or omit the second mention.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>After redevelopment, while the hospital remained the same, major upgrades were made to the surrounding transport infrastructure.</p>
<p>“Concerning access features” is a bit unnatural/formal. Instead, use:</p>
<p>✅ “In terms of transport facilities…”</p>
<p>✅ “With regard to public transport…”</p>
<p>🔹 3. Lexical Resource:</p>
<p>✅ Strengths:</p>
<p>Strong topic vocabulary: “transport facilities,” “infrastructure,” “redevelopment,” “hospital visitors,” “reserved for staff”</p>
<p>Accurate prepositions: “on the east side,” “connected to”</p>
<p>🔧 Suggestions:</p>
<p>Consider varying “access” a bit more to avoid repetition. You use “access” in multiple forms (road access, access features, reaching the hospital).</p>
<p>You can use:</p>
<p>“transport links”</p>
<p>“connection routes”</p>
<p>“entry to the hospital was improved…”</p>
<p>🔹 4. Grammatical Range and Accuracy:</p>
<p>✅ What’s good:</p>
<p>Good range of sentence structures: relative clauses, passive voice, present perfect/passive</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>*“…a bus station had been built for hospital visitors…” ✅ Excellent use of past perfect passive.</p>
<p>🔧 Errors to Fix:</p>
<p>❌ “…road access before and after it was developed as a city hospital connection.”</p>
<p>✅ Awkward and not idiomatic</p>
<p>✅ Better: “…before and after road access was improved to serve the City Hospital.”</p>
<p>❌ “…Reaching the hospital had been made easier…”</p>
<p>✅ Better: “Access to the hospital was improved by the addition of a public car park…”</p>

<h1 data-number="4"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Sample Band 8 Model (for comparison)</h1>
<p>The two maps illustrate the road access to City Hospital before and after improvements made in 2007.</p>
<p>Overall, while the hospital building itself remained unchanged, major developments were made to the surrounding infrastructure, particularly to traffic flow, parking, and public transport facilities.</p>
<p>Before the changes, Hospital Road was directly accessible from City Road, with bus stops located on either side of Hospital Road. A single car park, situated to the east of the hospital, served both staff and public.</p>
<p>Following redevelopment, two roundabouts were added—one at the intersection of Hospital Road and City Road, and another where Hospital Road meets the Ring Road. These roundabouts improved traffic circulation. A new bus station was constructed on the west side of Hospital Road and is now accessible via the roundabouts. The original car park is now reserved for hospital staff, and a new public car park was built to the east, accessible via a new road off the ring road.</p>

<p>Write:</p>
<p>The line graph shows the consumption of fish and three types of meat by each person in a European country over a 25-year period from 1979 to 2004.</p>
<p>Overall, it is clear that the minority of food consumption came from fish throughout the period, and the general trend was to move away from beef and lamb as chicken became the dominant meat source of this category.</p>
<p>In the first decade, beef consumption was the highest in the food categories listed. Despite reaching a low of about 150 grams, it then recovered to reach a high of about 230 grams per week. However, after 1988, beef consumption fell almost continuously, and by 2004 had almost 120 grams. Lamb almost exactly mirrored the fluctuation pattern of beef. Falling from the second-highest number at 150 grams in 1979 to approximately 60 grams per week by the end of the period.</p>
<p>In contrast, chicken began the period at below 150 grams in 1979, to took the lead from around 1989 onwards. Especially, the rise in chicken corresponds to the decline of beef and lamb, and by 2002, it hit a peak of about 260 grams before slightly dropping to 250 grams in 2004.</p>
<p>Fish was consistently eaten the least, beginning at around 60 grams per week, then dropping to below 50 grams. While it was the lowest, it remained relatively stable for the majority of the period.</p>
<ul>
<li>improve phrasing like:</li>
</ul>
<p>“to took the lead from around 1989 onwards” -&gt; “and overtook the other meats and fish in consumption from around 1989”</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid vague or incorrect causal links:</li>
</ul>
<p>“especially, the rise in chicken corresponds …” -&gt; “Notably, the increase in chicken consumption coincided with a decline in both beef and lamb.”</p>
<p>-&gt;</p>
<p><em>Chicken consumption, which started below 150 grams per person per week in 1979, steadily increased and surpassed all other meats by 1989.</em></p>
<p><em>Meanwhile, fish remained the least consumed protein throughout the entire period, showing minimal fluctuation.</em></p>
<p>not: “minority of food consumption came from fish”</p>
<p>-&gt;: “Fish accounted for the smallest proportion of consumption.”</p>
<p>not: “hit a peak of about 260 grams”</p>
<p>-&gt; “peaked at approximately 260 grams per person per week.”</p>
<p><em>Lamb followed a similar declining trajectory to beef, although its figures were consistently lower.</em></p>
<p><em>Chicken consumption rose steadily, eventually surpassing all other meat types.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>❌ <em>“to took the lead…”</em> (tense and structure error)</p></li>
<li><p>❌ <em>“Falling from the second-highest number…”</em> → This is a sentence fragment.</p></li>
<li><p>❌ <em>“Especially, the rise in chicken corresponds…”</em> → Misuse of the adverb</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Fragments like: <em>“Falling from the second-highest number at 150 grams…”</em> must be restructured:</p>
<p>“<em>Lamb consumption, which started at 150 grams, fell steadily throughout the period.</em>”</p>
<p>Work on <strong>tense consistency</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Past simple or past perfect is preferred for trends over time.</li>
<li>e.g.&nbsp;“had fallen to”, “peaked at”</li>

<p>Sample:</p>
<p>The line graph illustrates the weekly per-person consumption of fish and three types of meat in a European country between 1979 and 2004.</p>
<p><strong>Overall</strong>, while meat was consumed in significantly greater quantities than fish throughout the period, the general trend shows a decline in beef and lamb consumption and a sharp increase in chicken, which eventually became the most consumed meat.</p>
<p>In 1979, beef consumption was the highest, at over 200 grams per person per week. Although it dropped to around 160 grams early in the period, it recovered to a peak of 230 grams before experiencing a continuous decline after 1988, reaching just over 100 grams by 2004. Lamb followed a similar but less pronounced downward trend, falling steadily from 150 grams to approximately 60 grams.</p>
<p><strong>By contrast</strong>, chicken consumption began below 150 grams but rose steadily, overtaking both lamb and beef around 1989. It peaked at 260 grams per person in 2002 before slightly falling to 250 grams in the final year.</p>
<p>Fish consumption remained the lowest throughout the period, starting at around 60 grams and showing only a slight decline to just under 50 grams by 2004.</p>

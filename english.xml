<h3 data-number="2.0.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="part-by-part-analysis"><span class="header-section-number">2.0.1</span> <strong>Part-by-Part Analysis</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Part 1 (Booking/Everyday Conversation)</strong></p>

<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Word Forms Practice</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Train with minimal pairs: <em>student / students</em>, <em>pocket / pockets</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>After each practice test, highlight every wrong answer by word form.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Dictation Training (2–3 min daily)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Listen to BBC podcasts / IELTS audios.</p></li>
<li><p>Write exactly what you hear (focus on <strong>articles, plurals, prepositions</strong>).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Distractor Training</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pause when you hear corrections (e.g., “It’s £30 – no sorry £13”) and train to always write the <strong>final version</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Theme Vocabulary</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Build word banks by IELTS themes (Fashion, Society, Education, Environment).</p></li>
<li><p>Review spelling and collocations weekly. # Recording 1</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>6. WIVENHOE (you wrote “WAVENHOE”)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>In the audio the recruiter <strong>spells it</strong>: “W-I-V-E-N-H-O-E”.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trap:</strong> unfamiliar UK place names + similar /w/ vs /v/ sounds.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fix:</strong> when a name is spelled, write letter-by-letter as you hear it. If you’re unsure of a consonant (v vs w), mark it and confirm when they repeat (“It’s quite central, just off Cork Street.”).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>8. £9.75 (you wrote £9.70)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Exact line: “<strong>to begin with, you’d be getting £9.75,</strong> but that goes up to £11.25 after three months.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trap:</strong> IELTS often says decimals as <strong>“nine seventy-five”</strong> (not “nine point seven five”). It’s easy to drop the “five”.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fix:</strong> train your ear for pay figures said as “seventy-five / twenty-five”. Also listen for <strong>contrast markers</strong> (“to begin with… but… goes up to…”) to lock in the <em>starting</em> rate vs the raise.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9. deliveries (you wrote “delivery”)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Exact cue: “making sure there’s enough stock each week — and <strong>sorting out all the deliveries</strong>.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trap:</strong> the table prompt “Maintaining stock and organising ______” doesn’t force plural, but the audio does (“<strong>all the</strong> deliveries”).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fix:</strong> Use <strong>grammar signals</strong> from the audio: <strong>“all the”</strong> → plural count noun → <strong>deliveries</strong>. (Also note the table heading: “Responsibilities include” → plural tasks.)</p></li>

<section id="q1114-short-corrections-why" class="level2" data-number="5.1">
<h2 data-number="5.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="q1114-short-corrections-why"><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> <strong>1) Q11–14 — short corrections + why</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Q11 &amp; Q12 — your answers: E, B — correct.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>E (convenient for workers)</em> — Mark says the site was chosen because there’s demand for housing for employees (commuting problem).</p></li>
<li><p><em>B (easy access to local facilities)</em> — he mentions the excellent hospital and a large secondary school nearby.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q13–14 — you answered:</strong> 13 <strong>B</strong> (correct), 14 <strong>E</strong> (incorrect).</p>
<p>This was a <strong>two-answer question (choose TWO letters B—E)</strong>; the correct pair is <strong>B and C</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>B (the impact on the environment)</em> — the public said the layout “blended in well with the natural features” and there was “provision made for protecting trees and wildlife.” That’s direct evidence for B.</p></li>
<li><p><em>C (encouragement of good relations between residents)</em> — Mark said the development “seem[s] a place where people of all ages can live together happily.” That indicates social harmony / good relations.</p></li>
<li><p><em>E (rural location)</em> is <strong>not</strong> a positive comment extracted in that passage (they did say “short drive to get out into the countryside” but that’s not framed as a positive feedback about the development itself the same way B and C are).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>i missed the word ‘short drive to get out’</p>
<p><strong>So:</strong> correct pair = <strong>B and C</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>21 — C</strong></p>
<p><em>It had a profound effect on society.</em></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Michelle: “what I found more significant was how it impacted directly and indirectly on political events, as well as having massive social and economic consequences.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>22 — A</strong></p>
<p><em>The number of places producing observations.</em></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Adam: “I was surprised there were so many weather stations established by that time — so… you can see how the weather changed, often by the hour.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>23 — B</strong></p>
<p><em>It was associated with health issues.</em></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Reports from the period blamed the haze for an increase in headaches, respiratory issues and asthma attacks.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>24 — B</strong></p>
<p><em>He was the first to identify the reason for the haze.</em> (what Michelle claimed and Adam corrects)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Michelle implied Franklin realised it first; Adam says “He’s often credited with that… but a French naturalist beat him to it.” So Adam corrects her claim that Franklin was first.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>25 &amp; 26 — A and B</strong> (choose TWO)</p>
<p><em>A. how widespread the effects were</em></p>
<p><em>B. how long-lasting the effects were</em></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>They note strange weather events reported <strong>two years after</strong> the eruption and <strong>as far away as North America and North Africa</strong>, showing both <em>widespread</em> and <em>long-lasting</em> effects.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Trap:</strong> D (speed of ash cloud) is mentioned (“the ash drifted so swiftly”) but the question asks for <strong>two</strong> issues that <em>surprised</em> them — the dialogue stresses <em>extent</em> and <em>duration</em> most clearly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I choose D, mistake, and trapped. They said 2 answer in 1 sentence and i missed ‘the far away ….’</p>
<p><strong>27 — D (Iceland)</strong></p>
<p><em>Animals suffered from sickness.</em></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“the effect on livestock was devastating… they were poisoned because they ate vegetation that had been contaminated with fluorine.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>28 — A (Egypt)</strong></p>
<p><em>This country suffered the most severe loss of life.</em></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“the famine there led to more people dying than any other country. It was worse than the plague.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>29 — C (UK)</strong></p>
<p><em>There was a significant increase in deaths of young people.</em></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“mortality rate… about double the usual number and included an unusually high percentage of people under the age of 25.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>30 — F (USA)</strong></p>
<p><em>It caused a particularly harsh winter.</em></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>George Washington: “they were snowbound until March in Virginia” and reports of “ice floating down the Mississippi.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 data-number="6.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="quick-exam-tips-from-this-section"><span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> <strong>Quick exam tips from this section</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p>For “what surprised them” style questions, listen for <em>explicit</em> surprise phrases (“I found all that hard to believe,” “It must have been terrible”) tied to concrete facts (distance, duration).</p></li>
<li><p>When two answers are required, don’t pick a detail mentioned in passing (D/speed) unless the speakers emphasise it as surprising.</p></li>
<li><p>Note attributions: words like <em>“credited with”</em> vs <em>“actually first”</em> indicate subtle corrections (see Q24).</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="q24-franklin-and-the-haze" class="level3" data-number="6.2.1">
<h3 data-number="6.2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="q24-franklin-and-the-haze"><span class="header-section-number">6.2.1</span> <strong>❌ Q24 (Franklin and the haze)</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Your answer:</strong> not correct.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Correct answer: B — He was the first to identify the reason for the haze.</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p>Michelle says Franklin realised the haze was caused by a volcano. Adam then <em>corrects her</em>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“He’s often credited with that… but in fact a French naturalist got there first.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the <em>claim about Franklin</em> = <strong>He was the first</strong>. That’s exactly what option B says. The answer is <strong>B</strong> (even though it was wrong historically, the question is about the claim).</p>
<p><strong>Trap:</strong> Many test-takers confuse what Franklin <em>actually did</em> with what he was <em>credited for</em>.</p>
</section>
<section id="q25-two-things-that-surprised-them" class="level3" data-number="6.2.2">
<h3 data-number="6.2.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="q25-two-things-that-surprised-them"><span class="header-section-number">6.2.2</span> <strong>❌ Q25 (two things that surprised them)</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Your answer:</strong> one wrong.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Correct answers:</strong> <strong>A — how widespread the effects were</strong> &amp; <strong>B — how long-lasting the effects were.</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p>Adam says:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Reports came in not just from Europe but from North America and North Africa too.” → <strong>Widespread</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“And even two years later there were still odd weather events linked to it.” → <strong>Long-lasting</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Option D (<em>how quickly the ash cloud spread</em>) is <strong>mentioned</strong>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The ash drifted so swiftly…”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But notice — they don’t say they were <strong>surprised</strong> by that. The question is “What surprised them?” So only A &amp; B fit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Trap:</strong> IELTS loves to mention three things, but only two are correct. Many candidates pick the wrong extra detail (here: speed).</p>
<p>✅ Key learning for you:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Q24:</strong> Focus on <em>the claim</em> (not the correction).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Q25:</strong> Only tick things explicitly linked to “surprised / amazed / hard to believe.” # Recording 4</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Plural ending missed</strong> in the audio. The speaker said <em>“suits became popular”</em> — the final /s/ can be soft and easily missed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prediction error:</strong> when asked “Men started to wear ___ in the 18th century” you may have focused on the singular form of the clothing word instead of the general plural (we usually say <em>men wear suits</em>, plural).</p></li>

<p>Some answers to this question reveal a common problem with data tasks: drawing the wrong conclusions about what the data tell us. As we saw in lessons 1 and 3, this can present problems for TA score.</p>
<p>To understand the issue, think about where the data in the bar chart has come from. Data about people and how they live generally comes from some sort of survey, where people answer personal questions. Our current data would be based on the answer to <strong>one question</strong>.</p>
<p>Which of the following questions could have produced the data in the bar chart above?</p>
<p>A. <em>Are you planning to buy or rent a house in the future?</em></p>
<p>B. <em>Where do you live now?</em></p>
<p>C. Do you live in a house or a flat?</p>
<p>D. Do you rent or own your home?</p>
<p>E. Would you prefer to own a home or rent?</p>
<p>F. Where did you live before you moved to this house</p>
<p>The only question that fits the data in this charts is Option D: <em>Do you rent or own your home?</em></p>
<p>This means we do not have any information about where people moved from, or what their living preferences are. Yet some people write sentences like this:</p>
<p>It is clear from the chart that <font color="#ff0000">owned accommodation</font> become <font color="#ff0000">more popular</font> in the final 4 decades.</p>
<p>To be able to say that something is ‘<em>more popular</em>’, we would need to ask a different question in the survey in the survey. With our current data, we can only say that home ownership was <font color="#245bdb">more common</font> in the later years. We do not know if the people concerned <font color="#ff0000">preferred</font> or <font color="#ff0000">chose</font> to rent - they may have been forced through circumstances (e.g.&nbsp;a lack of money or job). If homelessness was increasing, we would not say that it was becoming ‘<em>more popular</em>’.</p>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Always think about what the data actually tells us - what question does it answer? Avoid using the words <font color="#245bdb">popular</font>, <font color="#245bdb">favorite</font>, or <font color="#245bdb">choice</font> unless the data answers a question such as ‘<em>Which do you prefer / enjoy?</em>’ OR where it is clear that a choice has been made.</p>

<h2 data-number="1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="is-there-data-to-support-our-description"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Is there data to support our description?</h2>
<p>The data in this chart is from 9 different years, so the same question would need to be asked in each of these years. The first year is 1918 and the last year is 2011, which means this data covers a period of 93 years. Do you think the people who were asked this question in 1918 are the same people answering the question in 2011? I think you’ll agree this is highly unlikely. What about between 1971 and 1991? Again, we do not know. This tells us another important point: the data set for each year can tell us about general trends within the population of England and Wales, but it does not tell us about the movements of individual people. Therefore, we can’t draw conclusions like this:</p>
<p>However, <font color="#ff0000">over the next 40 years, more and more residents managed to buy their own place and moved out of rented accommodation.</font></p>
<p>This is going too far. We don’t know whether the people who said they owned their home in 1991 and moved out of rental accommodation - we do not have data for this. They could be people who have just moved to the area after selling a house somewhere else, they could have lived with their parents until they could afford to buy a house, someone may have given the house to them. The increased numbers of home owners may be due to housing becoming cheaper and easier to buy, government support, or many more homes being built in the area. We do not know, so we cannot make statements about this is our answer.</p>

<p>We need to present clear, logical evidence to support the points we make. The same idea applies in writing task 1. IF we make a statement such as ‘<em>more and more resident</em> <font color="#ff0000">moved out of rented accommodation</font>’, then we need to be sure we can supply evidence from the data we are given to support this. If there is no evidence in the data about <font color="#ff0000">people moving house</font>, then the statement is not relevant to the task.</p>

<p>It is important to see the data set for each year in the graph as a separate set of people answering the survey question, and we shouldn’t try to connect the data in a cause and effect way. This is an important point in interpreting data, and a fact that is often repeated in academic writing that: <font color="#245bdb">correlation</font> (<em>two things matching or occurring at the same time</em>) should not be seen as <font color="#245bdb">causation</font> (<em>one thing being directly related to or caused by another</em>)</p>

<p>The increases in ice cream sales <font color="#245bdb">correspond</font> with increases in sun burn but this is <font color="#245bdb">correlation</font> not <font color="#245bdb">causation</font> - both just happen to occur in summer or hot weather.</p>

<p>Don’t try to find a connection between the data sets - we will not have enough information for this. We can talk about the data ‘<font color="#245bdb">corresponding</font>’, but we should not relate them directly or invent a story about what is happening.</p>

<h2 data-number="1.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="language-problems-in-this-task"><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> Language problems in this task</h2>
<p>This task presents some language challenges, especially as only 2 variables are mentioned (renting a home or living in a home you own). This means we need to try to avoid repeating the same words and phrases and we need to use different words to those in the question <strong>when possible</strong>. Remember, we do not need to vary this every time, sometimes a key word is unavoidable. We just need to reduce the number of times we repeat the same terms.</p>
<p>One way to do this is to vary the way we present the data. We can either write about the figures in the chart, or about the people behind the data. Look at the following examples, which all present the same fact:</p>
<ul>
<li><font color="#245bdb">The figure for rented</font> accommodation fell from just under 80% in 1918 to less than 70% in 1939.</li>
<li><font color="#245bdb">The percentage of people renting</font> accommodation fell from just under 80% in 1918 to less than 70% in 1939.</li>
<li><font color="#245bdb">Fewer people rented</font> accommodation in 1918 than in 1939 (just under 80% and 70% respectively)</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure to think about the people behind the statistic, and what the data presents.</p>

<h2 data-number="1.6" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="household-house-and-home"><span class="header-section-number">1.6</span> Household, House and home</h2>
<p>Although this question refers to ‘households’, this does not mean the people all lived in houses - they may have rented or owned a flat. A household refers to the group of people all living together within the same place - whether it is a house or flat. The word ‘home’ covers this nicely as a home refers to the place where we live, whether that is a tent, a boat, a flat, or a house.</p>
</section>
<section id="my-own-on-your-own-or-to-own" class="level2" data-number="1.7">
<h2 data-number="1.7" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="my-own-on-your-own-or-to-own"><span class="header-section-number">1.7</span> My own, on your own, or to own?</h2>
<p>The word ‘own’ often creates problems because of its different meanings and uses. For example, <font color="#245bdb">to own</font> is a verb meaning to have something that legally belongs to us; <font color="#245bdb">own</font> is also a pronoun, or can be used to mean ‘alone’</p>
<p>The verb ‘<font color="#245bdb">to own</font>’ is not used in the same way as the verb ‘to possess’, which has a much stronger meaning and is not appropriate in this context. Another important fact about the verb ‘to own’ is that it is a ‘stative’ verb, this mean it cannot be used in a continuous tense. So, we cannot say, ‘More people <font color="#ff0000">were owning</font> their home’. However, we can talk about ‘owning a home’ (the noun form of the verb), and we can also talk about ‘<font color="#245bdb">ownership</font>’ and ‘<font color="#245bdb">home ownership</font>’ (you will find this written as separate words, hyphenated, or as one word).</p>
<p>Look at the following sentences and decide whether the word ‘own’ is a verb, a pronoun, or means ‘alone’.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>That family is very rich, they live in a huge house and also <font color="#245bdb">own</font> 10 properties that they rent out. (verb)</li>
<li>I didn’t get my project finished because my family arrived and I couldn’t get any time <font color="#245bdb">on my own</font>. (alone)</li>
<li>I still live with my parents, I can’t wait to have <font color="#245bdb">my own</font> home. (pronoun)</li>
</ol>
<p>Consider also that, if we rent a property, someone owns it. The wording in the question and the chart is a little unhelpful here as it refers to ‘<font color="#245bdb">owned</font> accommodation’ and ‘<font color="#245bdb">rented</font> accommodation’. This works with ‘accommodation’ as the context is clear. But people are often tempted to write ‘<font color="#ff0000">living in an owned house / property</font>’, which does not work. We need to write ‘<font color="#245bdb">the percentage of people living in their own home</font>’ not ‘living in <del>an owned home</del>’</p>

<p>These words are useful umbrella terms to use as synonyms to avoid repetition.</p>
<p><font color="#245bdb">Sector</font> = and area of economic activity (similar to ‘field’ in the academic world). Examples of sector are: the banking sector; the tourism sector; the housing sector</p>
<p><font color="#245bdb">Market</font> = business or trade in a specific product (e.g.&nbsp;the rental market; the housing market)</p>
<p><font color="#245bdb">Category</font> = a group, or system of grouping similar information or things.</p>

<h2 data-number="1.8" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="points-to-rememer"><span class="header-section-number">1.8</span> Points to rememer</h2>
<ul>
<li>Spend a few moments noticing the details in the bar chart. Pay attention to what is being measured as well as when, and how is it being measured.</li>
<li>Identify the key trends in the data and think about how to write about these in our overview. Remember - we should not mention just one trend.</li>
<li>Think about: what stayed the same, what changed, what comparisons can be made.</li>
<li>Group the information together so that we can write about it logically. Chronological order is the clearest and most logical. Remember to make comparisons where relevant.</li>
<li>Our paragraphs should cover one main idea (e.g.&nbsp;The data for renting) and this should be clear to the reader.</li>
<li>As we write, remember to vary our tenses and our sentences structures.</li>

<p>The chart shows the statistics of owning and renting accommodation of families in England and Wales from 1918 to 2011. Overall, people tend to lean more towards having their own properties as renting a house becomes less and less common.</p>
<p>In 1918, owned accommodations were less common, with just over 20% of people. This figure grew rapidly to 50% in 1971 and overtook the proportion of households in rented accommodations. The proportion of family living in their own home continued to rise to the peak of nearly 70% in 2011 before slightly dropping in 2011.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the figure for rented accommodations began the period with a dominant percentage, at nearly 4 times that of owned home in 1918. There was a mild fluctuation in the proportion in the figure of those renting home in 1918 and 1953. The period between 1953 and 2001 experienced a gradual drop in the figure, with just over 30% at the end of the period, before a small rising in 2011.</p>
<hr>
<p>The chart illustrates the proportion of households in England and Wales that owned or rented accommodation between 1918 and 2011. Overall, the data shows a clear shift from renting to owning, with ownership becoming the dominant trend after the early 1970s.</p>
<p>In 1918, home ownership was relatively uncommon, accounting for just over 20% of households. This figure rose steadily throughout the period, reaching around 50% by 1971, at which point it overtook the share of rented homes. Ownership continued to increase, peaking at nearly 70% in 2001, before experiencing a slight decline in 2011.</p>
<p>By contrast, renting was the predominant form of housing in 1918, at almost four times the level of ownership. The percentage of renters fluctuated mildly between 1918 and 1953 but then fell consistently over the following decades, dropping to just over 30% by 2001. A small rebound occurred in 2011, although renting remained significantly less common than owning.</p>

<p>The diagrams show different stages in the manufacturing process of sugar from sugar cane. Overall, the linear process takes at least 12 months and comprises three main stages, each of which takes place in a different production area.</p>
<p>In the first stage, sugar cane is grown and nurtured for 12 to 18 months. After growing, sugar cane will be harvested by machine or by hand. It is crushed by a machine to remove sugarcane residue and produce juice. The juice then passed through a limestone filter, which removes any contaminants.</p>
<p>At the end of this stage, the pure juice is boiled over fire to remove excess water, after which the juice is evaporated and becomes syrup. It will undergo a centrifuge process, separating sugar crystals from the syrup. Finally, the sugar is drying and cooling to remove excess moisture.</p>

<p>The diagrams illustrate the various stages involved in producing sugar from sugar cane. Overall, the linear process takes between 12 and 18 months and comprises three main stages: growing, processing, and refining.</p>
<p>In the first stage, sugar cane is cultivated and nurtured in the field for 12 to 18 months. Once mature, it is harvested either manually, using a knife, or mechanically, with the help of a harvester. The harvested cane is then crushed by a machine to extract juice, while the remaining residue is discarded. This juice is subsequently passed through a limestone filter to eliminate impurities.</p>
<p>Next, the purified juice is boiled in an evaporator to remove excess water. As a result, a concentrated syrup is produced. This syrup is transferred into a centrifuge, which spins at high speed to separate sugar crystals from the remaining liquid.</p>
<p>Finally, in the refining stage, the sugar crystals are dried and cooled to remove any residual moisture. At this point, the refined sugar is ready for packaging and consumption.</p>

<h2 data-number="1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="stages-and-trends"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Stages and trends</h2>
<p>As we saw in lesson 9, process tasks have stages rather than trends, and it is these stages that we must highlight in our body paragraphs and summarise in our overview. We identity a trend by looking at the beginning point in the data. A common problem in process tasks is that, in their overview, candidates often mention only the first and the last stage in the process, thus confusing a stage with a trend. Look at the following example:</p>
<p><font color="#ff0000">The process consists of seven steps of various time length, starting by farming sugar canes and ending by dry sugar ready to use.</font></p>
<p>It not very helpful here.</p>
<p><em>There is an overview presented in the first paragraph which summaries the process into the farming stages and the drying stages. This summary could be more detailed, e.g.&nbsp;farming, crushing, separating and drying stages.</em></p>
<p>It is true that this is not a complete or clear overview because we do not get a clear picture of what happens between the farming of the sugar canes and the dry sugar at the end. However, the use of the word ‘detailed’ is unfortunate here. It would have been better to say that the overview needs to include more information in order to be a clear or complete overview.</p>
<p>Listing four of the steps in the diagram as example (e.g.&nbsp;farming, crushing, separating, and drying stages) also suggests you should include these words in our overview, which is not a good idea as they are given in the question. Later in this lesson we will look at how to avoid using words from the question paper, which is very important. In PC view, this advice is better expressed as follows: <font color="#245bdb">There is an overview presented in the first paragraph which mentions two stage: farming and drying. A clearer summary would give an overview of the main stages rather than just the first and the last steps in the process.</font></p>

<p>To identify the main stages in a process, we need to do more than just look at the beginning and end. Instead, we need to look at the different steps in the process and see if we can group them together in some way. This will help to categories them. With our current task, PC identified two main stages, each of which involves more than one step. Can you identify the two categories from the following list?

<h2 data-number="1.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="steps-and-stages"><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Steps and stages</h2>
<p>In lesson 4.2, PC recommended asking ourselves questions about a diagram, like this:</p>
<p><font color="#245bdb">Q: What are being shown here? A: This diagram is showing the steps involved in …</font></p>
<p>A step is one part of a process. Here are some useful phrases with the word ‘step’:</p>
<ul>
<li>When learning a new skill, it is best to do it <font color="#245bdb">one step at a time</font>. = (slowly and deliberately)</li>
<li>I will explain what you need to do <font color="#245bdb">step by step</font>. (=giving instruction in a logical order)</li>
<li>Changing the resources you need to use to practice is <font color="#245bdb">a step in the right decision</font>. (= a good starting point)</li>
</ul>
<p>The word ‘stage’ has a broader meaning:</p>
<p>We’re renovating the house <font color="#245bdb">in stages</font>, we’ll start with the downstairs areas, then do the upstairs rooms, and finally the area outside the house.</p>
<p>This mean than we can say that the diagram shows seven steps in a process, but we can also group these steps into key stages. This is very helpful in producing a clear overview, but we need ask a second question:</p>
<p><em>Q 1: What are we being shown here? Ans: The diagram shows the steps involved in a process.</em></p>
<p><font color="#245bdb">Q 2: What are main stages in this process?</font></p>
<p>Looking carefully at the diagram will help. One easy way to decide a ‘main stage’ is to look at the product or material being processed and noticing when it changes in form (e.g.&nbsp;from a plant to a juice). This means that, we need to notice:</p>
<ul>
<li><font color="#245bdb">What type of process it is (e.g.&nbsp;mechanical, manual)</font></li>
<li><font color="#245bdb">How many steps there are</font></li>
<li><font color="#245bdb">Where the process takes place</font></li>
<li><font color="#245bdb">the product and how it changes</font></li>
<li><font color="#245bdb">whether any of the steps can be grouped together into key stages</font></li>
</ul>
<p>In our current diagram there are seven steps numbered 1-7, but they are not all equal. Some are important separate stages (growing, harvesting) while others are smaller steps in a part of the process (purifying, evaporating, separating). Looking at how the product changes (from sugar canes, to juice, to syrup, then sugar) helps to group these together so that we can summarize them in a clear overview.</p>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>We can identify the main stages by grouping steps together. Remember, we are always looking for the main changes, so looking at when the product changes form can also help.</p>

<p>PC’s note for this step</p>

<p>For her overview, she identified two main stages 1) the growing and harvesting the crop and 2) the processing of the juice from canes to produce sugar. To make sure our overview is ‘complete’ and ‘clear’, we can include the following</p>
<ul>
<li>the type of process</li>
<li>how many stages there are and what these are (using umbrella terms)</li>
<li>what happens during the process (without giving too much detail) i.e.&nbsp;the main changes</li>
</ul>
<p>Although we can’t avoid giving some details here (e.g.&nbsp;sugar cane and sugar) try to avoid giving too many other details in this overview. Write our version below then compare it to her later when we look at her model.</p>

<h3 data-number="1.4.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview-practice"><span class="header-section-number">1.4.1</span> Overview Practice</h3>
<p>Try to predict what PC overview will look like by writing an overview statement that includes the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>the type of process</li>
<li>the number of stages and what they are (use umbrella terms)</li>
<li>what happens during the process (avoid giving too much detail here)</li>
</ul>
<p>linear process 2 stages farming, and processing</p>
<p>Overall, the linear process consists of two main stages, including sugar cane farming and processing of juice to produce sugar. # Changing the language in the question</p>
<p>Process tasks generally have more language on the question paper than other tasks. This helps us to understand what is happening but it also means we need to be careful: in order to show our language skills, we need to avoid just copying the language on the diagram.</p>
<p>The different steps in the process are labelled, usually with the noun form of a verbs (the ing form). For example, <strong>growing, harvesting, crushing, purifying, evaporating, drying and cooling</strong>. Steps 5 and 6 in our current diagram are unusual. Rather than adding more detail to the diagram (e.g.&nbsp;showing and labelling the syrup and the centrifuge), the question is tell us that, in step 5 ‘juice becomes syrup’ and in step 6 the centrifuge ‘separates sugar crystals from syrup’. So we have even more language to avoid copying here.</p>
<p>Repetition is another common problem in process tasks, as it is easy to use the same grammatical structures repeatedly. To solve these problems, use the language points below to build our vocabulary and our grammatical range and accuracy.</p>

<p>In our body paragraphs, we will need to change the ‘ing’ forms in the diagram and use the verbs actively or, more often, passively. For example:</p>
<p><font color="#245bdb">Step 1) growing -&gt; the sugar can is grown.</font></p>
<p>Be careful with verbs that cannot be used in the passive. Verbs like this cannot have an object. For example, the verb ‘fall’ cannot be used with an object (something can fall but we cannot fall something). So we can say:</p>
<p><font color="#245bdb">The apples fall into a bucket.</font></p>
<p>But we cannot say:</p>
<p>A worker <del>falls the apples</del> into a bucket.</p>
<p>Which is why we also cannot use it in the passive</p>
<p>The apples <del>are fallen</del> into a bucket.</p>
<p>Instead, we would need to use the verb ‘drop’ here.</p>
<ul>
<li><font color="#245bdb">A worker drops the apple into a bucket.</font></li>
<li><font color="#245bdb">The apples are dropped into a bucket.</font></li>
</ul>
<p>Problem verbs like these are called ‘intransitive verbs’ and we will see the letter [i] in brackets next to them in a dictionary. The verbs that can have an object are called transitive and have a [T] next to them. Some verbs can be both, depending on their meaning. Other intransitive verbs to be careful of (and which cannot be used in the passive) are:</p>
<p><font color="#245bdb">appear, arrive, become, come, disappear, go, jump</font></p>

<p>To avoid repeating the same structures, we can also use a relative clause or reduced relative clause to explain the result of a step. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The plants are crushed <font color="#245bdb">to extract</font> the juice.</li>
<li>The plants are crushed<font color="#245bdb">,</font> <font color="#245bdb">which extracts</font> the juice.</li>
<li>The plants are crushed<font color="#245bdb">, extracting the</font> juice.</li>
</ul>
<p>As we saw in the vocabulary note, sometimes, we can add the verb ‘allow’:</p>
<ul>
<li>The plants are crushed <font color="#245bdb">to extract</font> the juice.</li>
<li>The plants are crushed, <font color="#245bdb">which allows the juice to be extracted</font>.</li>

<p>Another way to avoid repeating the same structures is to use <em>after, once</em> or <em>when</em>. This allows us to use a present perfect or present perfect passive and show a range of grammatical structures.</p>
<p>Look at the following examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><font color="#245bdb">First the crop is grown and then it is harvested.</font></li>
<li><font color="#245bdb">After the crop has grown, it is harvested.</font></li>
<li><font color="#245bdb">Once the crop has grown, it is harvested.</font></li>
<li><font color="#245bdb">When the crop has grown, it is harvested.</font></li>
</ul>
<p>We can vary the tense of the second clause by saying it: it <font color="#245bdb">can be</font> harvested, or it <font color="#245bdb">will be</font> harvested. However, we cannot use ‘will’ immediately following after, once, or when</p>
<p>After / Once / When the crop <font color="#245bdb">will be grown</font></p>

<p>The diagrams show the process used to make sugar. Overall, this is a largely mechanical process comprising two main stages: the farming of sugar cane and the processing of the crop, which turns it into a liquid and eventually into sugar.</p>
<p>The first stage of the process is the longest as the sugar cane takes between 12 to 18 months to grow tall enough for harvesting. Once it is fully grown, the crop can be harvested in two ways, either mechanically using specialist machinery or by hand, a much more labour-intensive method.</p>
<p>The second stage is wholly mechanical and involves five steps. First, the plants are crushed to form a juice, which is then extracted. The juice is purified by passing it through a limestone filter before being heated. During this step, the liquid content of the juice evaporates leaving behind a syrup. The syrup is then put in a centrifuge and spun at a high enough speed to separate out the sugar crystals, which are subsequently dried and cooled to produce the final product.</p>

<ul>
<li>PC overview mentions the two main stages and the main changes, and these are reflected in her two body paragraphs.</li>
<li>She was able to make two comparisons: 1) the longest stage in the process and 2) comparising the different methods used for harvesting</li>
<li>In her editing, she read her answer aloud to see if there was repetition - this lead her to change to sentences to fix the following problems: 1) a repetition of ‘then’ (<em>Is then extracted … is then heated</em>) and 2) in the last sentence, she had written ‘which are <u>finally</u> dried and cooled to produce the <u>final</u> product.’. Notice the changes she made to avoid this. Be sure to read through our own answer in our head if we have time at the end.</li>
<li>Notice the clear coherence and cohesion in her answer. She signaled the main topic of each paragraph very clearly (The first stage … The second stage) and the information is logically organized, step by step. Try to notice the referencing and how we can easily trace the ideas (the zig-zag pattern we saw in lesson 9) ## Writing clearly</li>
</ul>
<p>Look back at the overview sentence we wrote earlier and compare it to her. How clear is our writing?</p>
<p>A problem can occur in our overview if we identify the main stages but then do note make these clear in our overview. Look at the following example:</p>
<p><em>Overall, the process compromises two main stages,</em> <font color="#c00000">where sugar canes and their juice are processed, and there are several different tools involved.</font></p>
<p>This overview begins well, stating that there are two main stages, but then presents the information as though this is one stage: <font color="#ff0000">where sugar canes and their juice are processed</font>. We need to show these are two separate stages:</p>
<p><font color="#245bdb">Overall, the process comprises two main stages, during which sugar canes are grown in the field, and then processed in the factory, when their juice is extracted and turned into sugar.</font></p>
<p>It is important to note that there are many ways to give our overview. For example, in the new version above she mentioned the two locations (the field and the factory). The following is another example of a clear overview.</p>
<p>The entire process includes a total of 7 stages with the plant undergoing various changes in form from solid to liquid then to syrup. Although the process is partly manutal, most of the stages involves heavy machinery.</p>

<p>The diagrams show different stages in the manufacturing process of sugar from sugar cane. Overall, the linear process takes at least 12 months and comprises three main stages, each of which takes place in a different production area.</p>
<p>In the first stage, sugar cane is grown and nurtured for 12 to 18 months. After growing, sugar cane will be harvested by machine or by hand. It is crushed by a machine to remove sugarcane residue and produce juice. The juice then passed through a limestone filter, which removes any contaminants.</p>
<p>At the end of this stage, the pure juice is boiled over fire to remove excess water, after which the juice is evaporated and becomes syrup. It will undergo a centrifuge process, separating sugar crystals from the syrup. Finally, the sugar is drying and cooling to remove excess moisture.</p>

<p>The diagrams illustrate the process by which sugar is produced from sugar cane. Overall, this is a <strong>linear and partly mechanical process</strong> that requires at least twelve months and can be divided into three main stages: cultivation, extraction and purification, and crystallisation with drying.</p>
<p>In the first stage, sugar cane plants are cultivated for a period of 12 to 18 months until they reach maturity. Once this has occurred, they are harvested either manually or using mechanical equipment. The stalks are then crushed to extract juice, which is subsequently purified through a limestone filter to remove any unwanted residue.</p>
<p>Following this, the filtered juice is boiled in order to evaporate excess water and is converted into syrup. This syrup undergoes centrifugation, during which sugar crystals are separated from the remaining liquid. In the final stage, the crystals are dried and cooled, producing refined sugar ready for distribution.</p>

<p>The diagrams show the different stages and equipment used in the cement-making process, and the production of concrete in building. Overall, the process comprises three main stages, which take place in different production areas.</p>
<p>Firstly, in the factory, limestone, clay are crushed to have raw powder. To create a thinner texture, it will be mixed by the mixer before being heated and rotated simultaneously by the rotating heater. The powder then moves to the grinder and becomes cement. After that, cement will be stored in bags and will be ready to use.</p>
<p>At the construction site, with a relatively small percentage of cement (15%), sand and gravel are added by a large percentage, by 25% and 50% respectively, and a little water (10%). The mixture is added to a concrete mixer to produce concrete.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Question (summary):</strong></p>
<p>The diagrams show how cement is made and how concrete is produced.</p>
<p><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Paraphrase: The diagrams illustrate the process of cement production, and how this material is used to produce concrete.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Overview</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cement production: takes place in a factory, involves several stages.</p></li>
<li><p>Concrete: made by mixing different materials at a building site.</p></li>
<li><p>Key contrast: one is multi-step manufacturing, the other is simple mixing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Body Paragraph 1 – Cement production</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Raw materials: limestone &amp; clay.</p></li>
<li><p>Crusher → powder.</p></li>
<li><p>Mixer → rotating heater → grinding → cement.</p></li>
<li><p>Cement packaged in bags.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Body Paragraph 2 – Concrete production</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Four ingredients: cement (15%), water (10%), sand (25%), gravel (50%).</p></li>
<li><p>Combine in a concrete mixer → final product = concrete</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The diagrams show the process of producing cement and how this is then used in the production of concrete for construction. Overall, cement production involves several stages that take place in a factory, while concrete is made by combining different materials in a mixer at the building site.</p>
<p>In the first stage of cement manufacture, limestone and clay are crushed together to form a powder. This mixture then passes through a mixer before entering a rotating heater, where it is simultaneously heated and mixed. The resulting substance is ground in a grinder to produce cement. The finished product is then packaged in bags for use.</p>
<p>Concrete production, on the other hand, is a much simpler process. Four ingredients are combined in a concrete mixer: 15% cement, 10% water, 25% sand, and 50% gravel. These are throughly mixed together to form concrete, which can then be used in construction.</p>

<p>The plans show the public park as it was opened in 1920 and the current layout following its redevelopment. Overall, while almost all facilities have changed, the new layout prioritizes to serve for dense activities, making the park more modern and family-oriented.</p>
<p>In the past, the park consisted of many facilities for relaxing and had several seats around. There were two entrances from 2 Street, a fountain in the middle, stages for musicians, and two rose gardens on the west side. On the east side of the park, there was were rose garden, a pond for water plants, and a glasshouse. In addition, there were several seats around the edge of the park.</p>
<p>Following the renovations, only the west rose garden and the two entrances remain the same, and a new entrance underground carpark has been added to the east side of the park. The fountain has been removed to make way for a rose garden, and all seats around the park have been moved to the center. On the west side, the old stage for musicians is replaced by an amphitheater, while just one rose garden still remains. These include a cafe, a children’s play area, and a water feature on the east side, replacing the rose garden, the pond for water land, and the glasshouse.</p>

<p>The plans show a public park as it appeared when it first opened in 1920 and its current layout after redevelopment. Overall, while most original facilities have been replaced, the park has been redesigned to cater to more active and family-oriented recreation.</p>
<p>In 1920, the park mainly provided spaces for relaxation. There were two entrances from Arnold Avenue and Eldon Street, with a fountain in the center. To the west, visitors could find a stage for musicians and two rose gardens, while the east side contained another rose garden, a pond for water plants, and a glasshouse. Benches were also placed around the edges of the park for people to sit.</p>
<p>Today, only the two original entrances and the western rose garden remain unchanged, and an additional entrance leading to an underground car park has been added on the east side. The central fountain has been replaced by a large rose garden with seating around it. On the west side, the old bandstand has been converted into an amphitheater. Meanwhile, the eastern side has undergone the most dramatic transformation: the pond, rose garden, and glasshouse have been removed and replaced with a cafe, a children’s play area, and a water feature.</p>
<p>The plans show the public park as it was when it opened in 1920 and its current layout after redevelopment. Overall, while almost all of the original facilities have been changed, the modern design focuses on providing spaces for a wider range of recreational activities, making the park more family-oriented.</p>
<p>In the past, the park contained several features for relaxation. There were two entrances from Arnold Avenue and Eldon Street, a fountain in the middle, a stage for musicians, and two rose gardens on the left side. On the right side, there was another rose garden, a pond for water plants, and a glasshouse. In addition, seats were placed around the edges of the park.</p>
<p>Following the renovations, only the rose garden on the left and the two original entrances remain unchanged, with a new underground car park entrance added to the right-hand side. The central fountain has been replaced by another rose garden, and all the seats have been moved to the center of the park. On the left, the old stage for musicians has been converted into an amphitheater, while the right side now includes a café, a children’s play area, and a water feature, replacing the former rose garden, pond, and glasshouse.</p>
<hr>
<p>The plans show a public park when it first opened in 1920 and how it looks today after redevelopment. Overall, while most original features have either been replaced or relocated, the park now provides a wider range of facilities for recreation, especially for families.</p>
<p>In 1920, the park was largely designed for relaxation and quiet leisure. A fountain stood at the center, surrounded by seats, with rose gardens in both the west and east corners. On the west side, there was a pond for water plants. Two entrances connected to the park to Arnold Avenue and Eldon Street.</p>
<p>Currently, the central fountain has been replaced by a rose garden with seating, and most other features have been modernized. The stage for musicians has been redeveloped into an amphitheater for concerts, while the pond, glasshouse, and eastern rose garden have all been replaced with a cafe, a children’s play area, and a water feature. The original entrances remain, but a new underground car park has been added to the east.</p>

<p><strong>Q36 — evidence (you wrote “evident”)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Why:</strong> After “no ___ that…”, English requires a <strong>noun</strong>, not an adjective.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Collocation:</strong> “no <strong>evidence</strong> that …” is the natural pair.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mini rule:</strong> If you hear “no / some / much / little ___ that…”, expect a <strong>noun</strong> (<em>evidence, proof, indication</em>).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Word-form pairs to remember:</strong> evidence (n) vs.&nbsp;evident (adj); confidence vs.&nbsp;confident; intelligence vs.&nbsp;intelligent.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q37 — destinations (you wrote “destination”)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Why:</strong> The script says “Little was known about the <strong>actual destinations</strong> of particular species and <strong>how they travelled there</strong>.” Also the note line reads “about the <strong>___ and journeys</strong>”, which signals <strong>parallel plurals</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mini rule:</strong> When a blank is coordinated with another <strong>plural</strong> (“X <strong>and</strong> journeys”), make <strong>both plural</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q38 — oceans (you wrote “ocean”)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Why:</strong> The lecture uses the collocation “over <strong>vast oceans</strong>.” IELTS often tests the faint <strong>-s</strong> at word ends.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mini rule:</strong> Quantifiers like <strong>vast</strong>, <strong>huge stretches of</strong>, and references to large areas often take the <strong>plural</strong> (<em>oceans, mountains, forests</em>). Listen for the final /z/ sound.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q40 — atlas (you wrote “atlat”)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Why:</strong> Simple letter transposition under time pressure. The line was “In 1931, <strong>an atlas</strong> was published…”.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mini rule:</strong> Use the <strong>article cue</strong>: “<strong>an</strong> atlas” → vowel sound → <em>atlas</em>. When you hear an article + noun, lock in the standard spelling you know.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Article cue for spelling:</strong></p>

<p>Conclusion/overall</p>
<p>One clear sentence: “Overall, the library will become more modern and family-oriented, with fewer traditional books and more digital/communal spaces.”</p>
<hr>
<p>The plans illustrate how a public library is set to be transformed after redevelopment. Overall, while traditional book storage will be reduced, the new layout will prioritize digital learning and community spaces, making the library more modern and family-friendly.</p>
<p>At present, the library consists of a central reading room with a small reception immediately inside the entrance. Bookshelves occupy both the left and the right sides of the building, while study tables are located at the back. In addition, there is a single computer room next to the reception area.</p>
<p>Following the renovations, the reception will be relocated to the center of the building and significantly expanded. A cafe will be added near the entrance, providing a space for visitors to relax. The left-hand side of the library will be converted into two computer laboratories, replacing the existing bookshelves. At the rear, the study tables will be removed to make room for a children’s area, including a story corner. Meanwhile, the right-hand side will contain fewer shelves, with several digital resource kiosks added instead.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>The word ‘fish’ is generally used as an uncountable noun (the plural ‘fishes’ is only used rarely to refer to different fish species). This includes different types of fish such as tuna, salmon, etc. So we can say ‘<em>the tuna swim</em>’, not “<em>the tunas swim</em>”</p>
<p>We can use the word to mean one fish: <em>the salmon swims</em> or several fish: <em>the salmon swim</em>.</p>
<p>NB Whales and dolphins are mammals and are countable nouns.</p>
</div>
</div>
<section id="language-used-in-process-task" class="level2" data-number="1.1">
<h2 data-number="1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="language-used-in-process-task"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Language used in process task</h2>
<p>We may need to describe:</p>
<p><em>time, different stages, physical changes, movement</em></p>
</section>
<section id="period-of-time" class="level2" data-number="1.2">
<h2 data-number="1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="period-of-time"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Period of time</h2>
<p>often saying how long a stage or step in a process <strong>takes</strong> or <strong>lasts</strong>, or how much time is <strong>spent</strong> <em>in a place</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>This stage <strong>lasts</strong> for four years.</em></li>
<li><em>The fry <strong>spend</strong> four years in the upper river.</em></li>
<li><em>It <strong>took</strong> five years to complete the renovations.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>With our current task, we cannot say: ‘<em>The salmon eggs <strong>take</strong> 5-6 months <strong>to break out of their eggs</strong></em>’, because we do not know how long this specific process takes and it is unlikely to take up 6 months for the fish to break out of their eggs.</p>
<p><strong>Phase, period, stage</strong>, and <strong>time</strong> are useful synonyms to use here, but be careful with the prepositions <strong>at</strong> and <strong>during</strong>. <strong>Phase</strong> and <strong>time</strong> can refer to either a length of time or point of time, and so we can use both <em>during</em> and <em>at</em> with these:</p>
<ul>
<li>During this phase NOT <del>at this phase</del></li>
<li>During this period NOT <del>at this period</del></li>
<li>During this stage, at this stage</li>
<li>During this time, at this time</li>

<h2 data-number="1.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="describing-physical-changes"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Describing physical changes</h2>
<p>We can use the following verbs to describe the physical changes that occur in a natural process:</p>
<p><em>Become, change, develop, grow, turn into</em></p>
<p>They are used slightly differently</p>
<div class="callout callout-style-default callout-tip callout-titled">

</div>
<div class="callout-title-container flex-fill">
Describing physical change
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p><strong>Become</strong> is often used with a comparative e.g.&nbsp;‘<em>become bigger</em>’, or to describe a change: e.g.&nbsp;‘<em>the smolt <strong>becomes</strong> an adult salmon</em>’.</p>
<p><strong>Change</strong> has a broader meaning and can be used to introduce the idea: e.g.&nbsp;‘<em>the fish then <strong>changes</strong> again and <strong>becomes</strong> …</em>’, or ‘<em>the fish then <strong>changes</strong> again, <strong>growing</strong> bigger …</em>’ It can also be used with ‘into’ e.g.&nbsp;‘the fry <strong>changes into</strong> a smolt’ NB not <del>changes to</del> a smolt.</p>
<p><strong>Develop</strong> and <strong>grow</strong> can be used with a specific feature: e.g.&nbsp;‘<em>the egg hatches and the young fish <strong>develops / grows</strong> fins and a tail</em>’. Or to describe a change: e.g.&nbsp;‘<em>the smolt <strong>develops into / grows into</strong> an adult salmon</em>.’</p>
<p><strong>Turn into</strong> is a phrasal verb and is similar in meaning to ‘change into’ or ‘become’ e.g.&nbsp;‘<em>the fry <strong>turn into</strong> a smolt</em>’</p>
</div>

<section id="some-words-to-be-careful-with" class="level2" data-number="1.4">
<h2 data-number="1.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="some-words-to-be-careful-with"><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Some words to be careful with</h2>
<p>We can’t use the verb <strong>evolve</strong> to describe this type of natural change.</p>
<p>Similarly, be careful with the verb <strong>transform</strong>, which suggests a change into something completely new. For example, <em>a ceterpillar <strong>transforms into</strong> a butterfly</em> or <em>Following the renovation, the old shed was <strong>transformed into</strong> a modern restaurant.</em></p>
<p>Make sure any adjectives or adverbs we use <strong>accurately</strong> describe what we are shown in the images. Can you see any problems in the following extracts?</p>
<p><em>The fish grow enormously in size during the final stage.</em></p>
<p><em>The huge salmon returns …</em></p>
<p><em>The fry migrate downstream to a highly turbulent water</em></p>
<p><em>At the end of this period, it turns into gigantic ‘adult salmon’</em></p>
<p><em>The fully developed salmon now have unique color patterns on their back…</em></p>

<li>The fully developed salmon now have unique color patterns on their back …</li>
</ol>
<p>In sentence 1 - 4, the adverbs or adjectives are too strong. Suggestions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The fish grow significantly during the final stage.</li>
<li>The large fish returns … OR The adult salmon returns … OR The fully grown salmon returns…</li>
<li>The fry migrate downstream to the faster running water.</li>
<li>At the end of this period, in turns into a large / fully grown ‘adult salmon’</li>
</ol>
<p>In sentence 5, we do not know if these patterns are ‘unique’ (other fish may have them and the diagram does not tell us this information) ‘characteristic’ or ‘distinctive’ are good words to use here:</p>

<li>The fully developed salmon now have distinctive color patterns on their back …</li>

<h2 data-number="1.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="numbers-and-describing-size"><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> Numbers and Describing size</h2>
<p>In process tasks we are more likely to be using small numbers. The general convention when writing numbers is to use the word form for the numbers one to ten and the numerals for numbers above ten. However, this is not a very important point to remember for the test.</p>
<p>Our writing task gives the following information about the size of the salmon in different stages of its like:</p>
<p><img src="https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/how-to-write-ielts-writing-task1-9/Pasted image 20250825160828.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>This give us a minimum and maximum length measured in centimeters. We can use the abbreviation ‘cm’ as shown in the image, but using the full word gives a better impression of our writing ability. There are two possible spellings: centimetres and centimeters. Try to be consistent in our spelling. We should often check for a mixture of cm, centimeters, centimetres.</p>
<p>There are several ways to describe the range of sizes above. Look at the following examples (notice the words in blue)</p>
<ul>
<li>The fry <font color="#245bdb">is between</font> three <font color="#245bdb">and</font> eight centimeters <font color="#245bdb">long</font>.</li>
<li>*The fry <font color="#245bdb">grows to between</font> three <font color="#245bdb">and</font> eight centimeters.</li>
<li>The fry <font color="#245bdb">can grow to between</font> three <font color="#245bdb">and</font> eight centimeters <font color="#245bdb">in length</font>.</li>
<li>The fry <font color="#245bdb">can reach up to</font> eight centimeters <font color="#245bdb">in length</font>.</li>
</ul>
<p>* We can also say: The fry <font color="#245bdb">grows to between</font> three <font color="#245bdb">and</font> eight centimeters <font color="#245bdb">in length</font>.</p>
<p>Can you correct the errors in the following sentences? Think about the type of relative clause you need to use to add extra information.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The salmon eggs take approximately 5-6 months to break out of their eggs and develop into baby <font color="#ff0000">salmons</font> called ‘fry’, <font color="#ff0000">with only 3-8 cm in length</font>. which are …</li>
<li>The little salmon can grow to more than three centimeters, less than eight in length. -&gt; grow to between 3 and 8 centimeters in length.</li>
<li>Fry evolve into smolt that is 12-15 centimeters. -&gt; Fry develop into smolt that is 12-15 centimeters in length.</li>
</ol>
<p>Suggested corections:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The salmon eggs take approximately 5-6 months to break out of their eggs and develop into baby salmon called ‘fry’, which are only 3-8 cm in length. (NB I used a non-defining relative clause to add the extra information about the length of the fry.)</li>
<li>The little salmon can grow to between three and eight centimeters in length.</li>
<li>Fry develop into / change into / turn into smolt, which are 12-15 centimeters in length / long. (Again, I need to use a non-defining relative clause here - notice the comma before which)</li>

<li>As a reader, what do you expect to follow on from this? -&gt; other steps of river</li>
<li>What information in this sentence do you expect to learn more about?</li>
</ol>
<p>The word ‘Firstly,’ tells us that this is the first step in the process, and as this is the first sentence in the paragraph, logically, when we read this sentence, we expect to learn more about the water or different parts of the river, like this:</p>
<p><font color="#245bdb">Firstly, in the upper river, the water moves slowly. Then, as the water moves down the river, it flows faster.</font></p>
<p>But this candidate wrote:</p>
<p><font color="#c00000">Firstly, in the upper river, the water moves slowly. Salmon eggs are left below reeds and small stones before becoming young salmon called fry.</font></p>
<p>The information about the water in the upper river in the first sentence <strong>is</strong> important, but it is not the main idea or topic of the paragraph, and it is not the first step in the process. This is extra information about where the first step takes place (<em>the salmon eggs are left below reeds</em>). A relative clause will help here.</p>
<p><font color="#245bdb">Firstly, salmon eggs are left below reeds and small stones in the upper river, where the water moves slowly.</font></p>
<p>In the extract in red above, the second step in the process is reduced to ‘<em>before becoming young salmon called fry</em>’. This is too much information to add to our new sentence, so we need to find a way to refer back to the salmon eggs (which is where the young salmon come from):</p>
<p><font color="#245bdb">Firstly, salmon eggs are left below reeds and small stones in the upper river, where the water moves slowly. These eggs then become young salmon and are called ‘fry’.</font></p>
<p>Think about the information in our sentences following this pattern:</p>
<p><img src="https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/how-to-write-ielts-writing-task1-9/Pasted image 20250825163120.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>In the above image, we can see that the new information at the end of one sentence becomes the subject or the main idea at the beginning of the next sentence, working in a zig-zag pattern. We can add more information in between these sentences, but the change in focus should be made clear to the reader and we should be able to trace it clearly through our writing.</p>

<p>There are four stages in the life cycle of the Monarch butterfly.</p>
<p>In the first stage, eggs are laid on a plant.</p>
<p>After about four days, the eggs hatch into baby caterpillars, which are known as larvae.</p>
<p>The larvae eat almost continually at this stage, growing in size.</p>
<p>After two weeks, it is fully grown and can now begin a process called metamorphosis.</p>
<p>During metamorphosis, the larvae will form a chrysalis, which is a hard protective coating.</p>
<p>The chrysalis stage lasts for ten days.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The salmon is a very common type of fish. The question introduces it to us as ‘<em>a species of large fish called the salmon</em>’ to help lower candidates understand the word. We don’t need to introduce it like this in our answer - we would only need to do this with a lesser-known species.</p></li>
<li><p>As the diagram shows, salmon live in both the river and the sea.</p></li>
<li><p>Look at the other details I noticed in the diagram before writing my answer. <img src="https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/how-to-write-ielts-writing-task1-9/Pasted image 20250825165729.png" class="img-fluid"></p></li>
<li><p>There are several details we need to pay attention to in a diagram like this:</p></li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li><font color="#245bdb">The arrows</font> - these can be used with different meanings, e.g.&nbsp;to show movement or to show a change. Here they are showing movement between different habitat.</li>
<li><font color="#245bdb">The key</font> (the extra information in the box) - this tells is the sizes and names of the fish in each stage. Notice that inverted commas have been used for the names. This shows that a word or phrase is being used in an unusual or technically way that may not be commonly known, which can affect how we use these terms in our writing.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The instruction to make comparisons ‘<font color="#245bdb">where relevant</font>’ applies more in process tasks than any other type of task 1 question. We may need to remind ourselves at stage 2 of our planning (when identify key ideas) to see if there is anything we can compare. In this task, we can compare the different environments (<font color="#245bdb">faster / slower</font>) and the fish (<font color="#245bdb">bigger / longer</font> etc). We might also compare its physical appearance (<font color="#245bdb">lighter / darker coloring</font>) or the lengths of time (the first stage is <font color="#245bdb">the shortest</font>). However, this instruction may not always be <font color="#245bdb">relevant</font> in a process task.</li>

<p>The diagram shows the different stages in the life cycle of a salmon. Overall, the cycle takes almost ten years and comprises three main stages, each of which takes place in a different aquatic environment.</p>
<p>The salmon begins life as an egg. In the slow-moving waters of the upper river, sheltered by reeds and small stones. Over a period of five to six months, the eggs hatch into very small fish known as ‘fry’, which can grow up to eight centimeters in length. The fry then move to the faster flowing water of the lower river, where they remain for a period of four years and continue to grow. During this phase, they can double or triple in size, reaching 12 to 15 centimeters, and are now referred to as ‘smolt’.</p>
<p>At the end of this stage, the smolt leave the river for the open sea, where they will spend the next five years of their life. It is in this salt-water environment that the fish develops its characteristic shape and coloring and reaches its full length of 70 to 76 centimeters, almost ten times its original size. Finally, the adult salmon will return to the slow-moving river to lay its eggs, and the cycle will begin again.</p>

<ul>
<li>I used inverted commas to introduce the new terms (‘fry’ and ‘smolt’) but only with the first mention of these terms.</li>
<li>Notice the way that I was able to use different tenses. I used: the simple present, modals (<em>can grow, can double</em>), the passive (<em>are referred to</em>), and future tenses (<em>will spend, will return, will begin</em>). I also varied between the plural (<em>the fry move, the smolt leave</em>) and singular (<em>the fish develops</em>). However, these variations are grouped together logically (i.e.&nbsp;I did not change backwards and forwards between the different tense or between singular and plural).</li>
<li>In terms of organization, I decided to write about stages one and two in the first paragraph, and then stages three and one (return to the beginning) in the second paragraph.</li>
<li>My answer is 208 words. There is no ideal length and each task will be different. However, you should aim to write between 160 and 220 words. I have never seen an answer with 150 words that was complete, so I don’t advise you to aim for this length. In the next exercise, you will practise working on a shorter answer</li>

<p>Process task’s answer can be little too short (below 150 words). Every test question is tested to make sure that there is enough to write about. When practising, be sure to only use authentic materials or those written by experienced test writers (look for the authors mentioned ..)</p>
<p>If we find that our answers are sometimes too short, look back at the diagram and think about the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are there any key features you have missed?</li>
<li>Are there any key features you have not highlighted enough?</li>
<li>Have you made any comparisons?</li>
</ul>
<p>Also think about the verbs we have used to describe a change - have we been too concise? (For example, although it is accurate to say that ‘<em>The fry become smolt</em>’), this could be developed and expanded to give more information about what is happening at this stage.</p>
<p>Short answers</p>
<p>The diagrams show the process through which a kind of fish called the salmon grows into an adult. The lifecycle of the salmon has 3 main stages and takes place in 3 different locations.</p>
<p>The cycle begins when salmon eggs are laid among the reeds and the small stones of the upper river. After around 5 to 6 months, these eggs turn into fry, which are 3-8 cm in length and begin to move to lower river where water flow is fast.</p>
<p>Fry live there for 4 years and become smolt, measuring 12-15 cm in length, after which they migrate to open sea. They live this new environment for approximately 5 years to become adult salmon (70-76 cm). The adult salmon then begins its journey back to slow-moving upper river where it lays eggs and the process starts over again.</p>

<p>Which parts of the answer could the candidate work on to add more? There are also issues with articles and commas here, can you onto the image in the next exercise using the text tool. Then look at my comments and the changes I made.</p>
<p>Look at my notes below and compare them to yours before making the changes</p>
<p>in the next task.</p>
<p>NB in the final paragraph, the writer is saying that the salmon ‘’live there to become adult salmon’’ something is missing here as ‘to become’ is being given as a reason why they live in the sea. Instead, we need to know what changes occur when they live in the sea.</p>

<p>Look at the following four extracts from this answer. Make the suggested longer.</p>
<p>changes in brackets to improve the answer and make</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The lifecycle of the salmon has 3 main stages and takes place in 3 different locations. (Can you add more to the overview?)</p></li>
<li><p>After around 5 to 6 months, these eggs turn into fry, which are 3-8 cm in length and begin to move to lower river where water flow is fast. (Can you add a reference to the upper river and a comparison?)</p></li>
<li><p>Fry live there for 4 years and become smolt, measuring 12-15 cm in length, after which they migrate to open sea. (Add more here and perhaps a comparison about the size?)</p></li>
<li><p>They live in this new environment for approximately 5 years to become adult salmon (70-76 cm). (Something information is missing here)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The diagrams show the process through which a kind of fish called the salmon grows into an adult. The lifecycle of the salmon lasts almost ten years and has three main stages, each taking place in a different location.</p>
<p>The cycle begins when salmon eggs are laid among the reeds and the small stones of the upper river. After around five to six months in the slower-moving waters, these eggs turn into fry, which are 3-8 cm in length and begin to move to the lower river, where the water flow is faster.</p>
<p>The fry live there for four years growing bigger and changing into what are called smolt, measuring 12-15 cm in length, after which they migrate to the open sea. They live in this new environment for approximately five years developing into adult salmon and reaching their full size (70-76 cm). The adult salmon then begins its journey back to the slow-moving upper river, where it lays eggs and the process starts over again.</p>

<p>Look back at any process task answers you have written in the past and consider your overview statement. Did you include features such as:</p>
<p>how many stages there are in the process overall length of time where the stages take place?</p>
<p>Look at the length of your answers - do they tend to be short? (under or very close to 150 words)? Look back at the diagrams and check the following: Did you use an authentic task (from Cambridge books 9 - 16)? If not, there may not be enough to write about, which is why your answer is too short. Were you too brief in some parts of the summary? Which parts could you expand more?</p>
<p>Remember to think about the following:</p>
<p>Are there any key features you have missed?</p>
<p>Are there any key features you have not have highlighted enough? Have you made any comparisons?</p>
<p>Coherence</p>
<p>and cohesion</p>
<p>Check the coherence and cohesion of your process task answers. Reading the answers aloud can help. Do you vary the beginning of your sentences, or do they always / mainly begin like this:</p>
<p>First, …Then, …. Next, …. After this, …..Following this, ……</p>
<p>Finally,…..</p>
<p>Can you trace the ideas in your summary using the zig-zag pattern we saw in the Monarch butterfly summary? What changes can you make now to improve the coherence and cohesion?</p>
<p>Language Did you manage to vary the tenses in your answer? What changes could you make? Is there any new language you would like to make a note of to use in the future?</p>

<p><strong>Q36 — evidence (you wrote “evident”)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Why:</strong> After “no ___ that…”, English requires a <strong>noun</strong>, not an adjective.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Collocation:</strong> “no <strong>evidence</strong> that …” is the natural pair.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mini rule:</strong> If you hear “no / some / much / little ___ that…”, expect a <strong>noun</strong> (<em>evidence, proof, indication</em>).</p></li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Q37 — destinations (you wrote “destination”)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Why:</strong> The script says “Little was known about the <strong>actual destinations</strong> of particular species and <strong>how they travelled there</strong>.” Also the note line reads “about the <strong>___ and journeys</strong>”, which signals <strong>parallel plurals</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mini rule:</strong> When a blank is coordinated with another <strong>plural</strong> (“X <strong>and</strong> journeys”), make <strong>both plural</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q38 — oceans (you wrote “ocean”)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Why:</strong> The lecture uses the collocation “over <strong>vast oceans</strong>.” IELTS often tests the faint <strong>-s</strong> at word ends.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mini rule:</strong> Quantifiers like <strong>vast</strong>, <strong>huge stretches of</strong>, and references to large areas often take the <strong>plural</strong> (<em>oceans, mountains, forests</em>). Listen for the final /z/ sound.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q40 — atlas (you wrote “atlat”)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Why:</strong> Simple letter transposition under time pressure. The line was “In 1931, <strong>an atlas</strong> was published…”.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mini rule:</strong> Use the <strong>article cue</strong>: “<strong>an</strong> atlas” → vowel sound → <em>atlas</em>. When you hear an article + noun, lock in the standard spelling you know.</p></li>

<hr>
<p>The plans illustrate how a university sports center is set to be transformed after redevelopment. Overall, the sports center will become more convenient and indoor-oriented, with no outdoor activities and more communal space.</p>
<p>At present, the sports center consists of a relatively small building and two outdoor courts on each side. The building houses a 25-meter pool, and its facilities include a changing room and a seating area, and there is a gym on the rear and a reception area to the front.</p>
<p>Following the renovations, only the central pool and its facilities remain the same. The building will be expanded to the west and east, removing outdoor courts and making way for more indoor facilities. These include a leisure pool on the western side, which is slightly larger than the central pool, and will have its own changing room, and on the western side, a new sports hall, and two dance studios. The current gym will be lengthened so that it is double its current size. The reception area will also be widened, making it more spacious. On arrival, the visitors to the new center will benefit from a third changing room, a sports shop, and a cafe, all located around the reception area.</p>

<p><strong>Q34 – SMARTPHONES</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Your answer:</strong> SMARTPHONE (singular)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Correct answer:</strong> SMARTPHONES (plural)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reason:</strong> The passage says:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Think about smartphones. They didn’t even exist until comparatively recently, but today young people use them all the time…”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The plural form is required because the speaker refers to the widespread use of many devices, not just one.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Q36 – PLAYGROUND</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Your answer:</strong> CONVERSATION</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Correct answer:</strong> PLAYGROUND</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reason:</strong> The passage says:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“teachers have found that playground conversations in Icelandic secondary schools can be conducted entirely in English…”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The notes require the <strong>location</strong> where discussions occur, not the activity itself. So “playground” (location) is correct rather than “conversation” (activity).</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p>The key is to match what the notes are asking for—<strong>context/location vs.&nbsp;action</strong> and <strong>plural vs.&nbsp;singular</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tip: after verbs like <strong>keep/maintain/update</strong>, IELTS often expects a plural noun when tracking multiple items (e.g., <em>keep</em> <strong><em>records</em></strong> <em>of books</em>, <em>keep</em> <strong><em>lists</em></strong> <em>of names</em>).</li>

<p><em>I recently watched a production of Romeo and Juliet at The Emporium Theatre. I had read the play before, but watching it live was very different.

The costumes were modern, which I didn’t expect, but I think it worked. I liked the music at the start, but later it didn’t have much effect. One thing I didn’t like was that some actors spoke too fast or quietly, so I couldn’t always understand them.

<p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>
<p><em>Recently, I watched a production of Romeo and Juliet at The Emporium Theatre. I had read the play before, but seeing it performed live was a completely different experience. The set design was visually stunning and probably the most memorable aspect of the performance. The lighting created the right atmosphere for different scenes, though some moments were a bit dim and hard to follow. The costumes were contemporary, which surprised me initially, but ultimately I thought it worked well and added a fresh perspective. The music at the start was brilliant, though it didn’t have much impact later in Acts 2 and 3, which was a little disappointing. One aspect that I think could have been improved was the actors’ delivery of lines. Some spoke too quickly, while others weren’t loud enough, which made it difficult to catch every word. Overall, the performance had a powerful emotional effect on me, particularly the ending, which intensified the drama. I found it a very engaging and thought-provoking experience, and it reminded me why Shakespeare’s works remain so relevant today.</em></p>

<p><strong>Topic: Theatre, Culture, and Literature</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Why do you think classic plays like <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> are still performed today?</p>

<li><p>How important is the role of the director in a theatre production?</p>

</ul></li>
<li><p>What makes a performance memorable for the audience?</p>
<ul>

</ul></li>
<li><p>Do you think watching plays in translation affects your understanding?</p>

<li><p>Why are Shakespeare’s plays so popular internationally?</p>
<ul>
<li><em>They’re versatile and can be interpreted in many ways. Directors can experiment with different settings, costumes, or time periods while keeping the story’s essence intact. Also, the characters are complex, which allows audiences across cultures to connect with them.</em></li>

  <title>Languages die out</title>
  <dc:creator>Hung </dc:creator>
  <link>https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/w2-language/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Every year, several languages die out. Some people think that this is not important because life will be easier if there are fewer languages in the world.</p>
<p>To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?</p>
<p>It is helpful to turn the statement in the task into a question. In this case, we could see this as two separate questions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Is it important that languages are dying out every year?</li>
<li>Does having fewer languages make it easier?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>To answer these question, we will need to discuss the impact that the loss of languages has. Clearly, it will affect the people whose language is dying out. However, the opinion in the question is about the impact this has on the world in general : <em>‘life will be easier (for everyone) if there are fewer languages in the world’</em>. Therefore, the focus in this question is on both one specific group (the people losing their language) and the world at large (everyone else).</p></li>
<li><p>The ideas we have for this task are more likely to be based on abstract themes. Concrete themes, such as <em>money, food, or socializing</em> are often easier to write or talk about. More abstract ideas, such as ‘life’, ‘society’, and ‘culture’ are more difficult to discuss, which adds another level of difficulty to this task. If we have an abstract topic, visualization techniques can help us to see more concrete ideas within the topic that then will help us to write about it.</p></li>
<li><p>The question tells us that, ‘Some people think that (the loss of language) is not important’. In other words, we are being told about an attitude or reaction to something, and we will need to discuss this attitude in our essay. We are also told these people think that ‘life will be easier’ without these language, so they are also commenting on the effect or impact that this will have. Thus, again, we need to consider cause and effect in this essay.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Introduction General topic Disappearing language</p>
<p>Focus: people in remote areas + people in general</p>
<p>Issue to discuss: is it important that languages are dying out? Does it make life easier?</p>
<p>My initial position: I completely disagree - yes, it is important</p>
<p>Themes: Language, culture, changing world, people, communication</p>
<p>Side A: Life is easier / the loss is unimportant</p>
<p>Main topic of this paragraph: How life is made easier (benefits of loss)</p>
<p>1 Language - use it every day - business communication and travel -&gt; transactions easier if people understand each other + problems can be solved faster</p>
<p>2 culture - can understand the culture -&gt; x</p>
<p>3 Changing world =</p>
<p>changes to language are inevitable (more travel, more international business -&gt; need to communicate more)</p>
<p>4 people - easier for business people and travellers</p>
<p>What did i show or prove? link to the question? Easier for certain people / situations - loss is inevitable</p>
<p>Side B: The loss is important</p>
<p>Main topic of this paragraph</p>
<p>The negative effects of this loss</p>
<p>1 Language - Yes, business is easier, BUT language is used for more than this e.g.&nbsp;express feelings + culture + history</p>
<p>2 Culture - language used to express culture (poems, literature, history = adds variety / makes the world richer)</p>
<p>= part of identity of individuals and community</p>
<p>3 People - -&gt; for the people involved this is a big loss + for the world, this is a big loss</p>
<p>What prove</p>
<p>Some people are far more affected by the loss than others</p>
<p>Conclusion - Summary of my main points:</p>
<p>Yes, it makes business easier but language adds variety and makes the world richer.</p>
<p>Question to answer: To what extent do you agree / disagree?</p>
<p>My final position: I completely disagree</p>
<p>In some parts of the world, native languages are being lost as societies develop and evolve. Some believe that this is unimportant and even see it as an advantage. This essay will discuss whether the loss of such languages should be cause for concern.</p>
<p>It is true that many aspects of modern day life are made easier through sharing a common language. First and foremost, business transactions are much simpler when the two parties concerned can understand each other well. Travel problems can also be dealt with much faster when there is mutual understanding. Thanks to globalization, these types of communication are increasing, and this could be seen as largely responsible for the disappearance of languages in more remote areas. If people in those areas work in tourism, or international trade, they must adopt the more widely used languages of the world. Thus, with each new generation, their native tongue becomes both less useful and less used. Sadly, the desire to make life simpler makes the loss of some languages inevitable.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this inevitability does not mean the loss is insignificant. Language has a multitude of uses that go far beyond tourism and business communication. Our native tongue is used to express our deepest feelings and emotions, which are much more difficult to convey when using a second language. Language also plays an important part in our culture and identity, uniting us as a community. Thus, when a language is lost, part of the community and culture also disappears. This must be an enormous loss for the people concerned.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while it is true that having fewer languages benefits the world of business, and makes transactions easier, I completely disagree with the view that the continued loss of languages is unimportant. The variety of native languages and cultures is what makes the world a richer place, and any loss of this kind should not be dismissed lightly.</p>

</ul></li>

<p>Some people think that people should read books from their own country, while others believe that reading international literature is more important. Discuss both views and give your opinion.</p>
<p>Plan</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>General topic: Reading and literature</p>
<p>Focus: Local vs international literature</p>
<p>Issue to discuss: Should people read national or international works?</p>
<p>Position: While local literature is important, international literature has broader benefits</p>
<p>Themes: culture, identity, personal development, education, global awareness</p>
<p>Side A: Local literature is important</p>
<p>Main topic of paragraph: Benefits of reading literature from your own country</p>
<p>1 culture &amp; identity - local stories reflect national history, traditions, values -&gt; helps develop sense of belonging</p>
<p>2 Language skills - written in familiar language -&gt; easier comprehension and engagement</p>
<p>3 Heritage &amp; Knowledge - understanding historical events, local society -&gt; educates younger generations</p>
<p>link back: shows why reading local literature is valuable and necessary</p>
<p>Side B international literature is important</p>
<p>main topic: benefits of reading literature from other countries</p>
<p>1 cultural awareness &amp; empathy - exposure to different ways of life, social issues, moral dilemmas</p>
<p>2 critical thinking &amp; creativity - compare different societies, challenge assumptions</p>
<p>3 global perspective helps navigate an interconnected world, broadens horizons</p>
<p>link back: shows why international literature is increasingly important.</p>
<p>conclusion</p>
<p>summary of main points: local literature promotes identity; international literature promotes understanding and critical thinking</p>
<p>final position: balance is best - engage with both, but international exposure is essential for broader personal growth</p>
<p>In many countries, there is an ongoing debate about whether people should focus on reading books from their own nation or whether exploring international literature is more beneficial. While literature from one’s own country certainly has value, I believe that reading works from around the world provides wider benefits for personal development and understanding.</p>
<p>It is true that local literature plays an important role in preserving culture and identity. Stories written by authors from one’s own country often reflect national history, traditions, and social values. By reading these works, individuals gain a deeper understanding of their heritage, which can strengthen a sense of belonging and connection to their community. Moreover, local literature is usually written in a familiar language, which makes it easier for readers to engage with the content and appreciate the subtleties of style and expression. For younger generations, these books provide knowledge of historical events and societal norms, ensuring that important cultural lessons are not forgotten.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, reading international literature offers benefits that local works alone cannot provide. Exposure to stories from different countries allows readers to develop empathy and a broader understanding of diverse cultures. International literature can present social issues, moral dilemmas, and everyday experiences that are entirely different from one’s own, encouraging critical thinking and reflection. Additionally, such reading fosters creativity, as comparing different societies and styles challenges assumptions and expands the imagination. In today’s increasingly interconnected world, having a global perspective is essential, and international literature is an effective way to achieve this.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while books from one’s own country are valuable for preserving identity and cultural knowledge, reading international works offers a broader understanding of humanity and encourages personal growth. Therefore, I would argue that a balanced approach is ideal: people should read both local and global literature, but international exposure should play a central role in fostering a well-rounded worldview.</p>

  <title>Learning second language of children</title>
  <dc:creator>Hung </dc:creator>
  <link>https://kimhungbui.github.io/english/w2-children-second-language/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Some people think that children should learn a second language at primary school. Others believe it is better to wait until secondary school. Discuss both views and give your opinion.</p>
<p>introduction</p>
<p>In many parts of the world, when children begin to learn a second language has become a topic of debate. This essay will discuss both sides of the argument and explain why I completely agree that starting at primary school is more beneficial.</p>
<p>It is true that <del>children who are learning language earlier</del> children who start learning a second language early are more receptive to new sounds and structures than those who start later. First and foremost, at primary school age, children’s brains are more flexible, allowing them to <del>pick up pronunciation and grammar more naturally</del> acquire correct pronunciation and grammatical structures with greater ease. As a result, they often develop a stronger accent and better overall fluency than those who start later. Furthermore, learning a language does not need a highly abstract <del>thinking</del> cognitive <del>skill like math, physics, …</del> subjects like mathematics and physics, which are normally developed in more mature students. <del>So, letting them invest in a second language when in primary school is a better investment than other fields.</del> -&gt; Therefore/ Hence, it is more effective to focus on second language acquisition at primary school than on other fields.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, some argue that children should begin learning a second language at secondary school or later, rather than at primary school. They suggest that older students have more developed cognitive abilities, allowing them to grasp complex grammar rules and language structures more quickly than younger learners. As a result, <del>they can learn language more effectively in a shorter time than younger age</del> they may achieve noticeable progress in a shorter period. In addition, adolescents may be more motivated because they can appreciate its relevance to future education and career opportunities / they can understand the relevance of language learning for their future education and career prospects. <del>Because of that, they can have a choice of themself about which language they should learn and be more independent in the road of learning.</del> They also have more autonomy in choosing which language to study and can take greater responsibility for their learning. While these points have some merit, I believe the advantages of starting early outweigh the benefits of a later start.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while some argue that older children may learn a second language more quickly due to their cognitive maturity and motivation, I firmly believe that starting at primary school is more beneficial. Early exposure provides a longer period for practice, enhances pronunciation and grammar acquisition, and supports overall cognitive development. Consequently, beginning language learning at a young age offers advantages that outweigh those of a later start.</p>

<section id="can-you-tell-me-about-your-hometown" class="level2" data-number="1.1">
<h2 data-number="1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="can-you-tell-me-about-your-hometown"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Can you tell me about your hometown?</h2>
<p>My hometown is Nha Trang, a coastal city in central Vietnam. It’s famous for its beautiful beaches, fresh seafood, and relaxed lifestyle. What I like most is the ocean view, because it makes the city feel peaceful even when it’s busy.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-do-you-like-most-about-your-hometown" class="level2" data-number="1.2">
<h2 data-number="1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-do-you-like-most-about-your-hometown"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> What do you like most about your hometown?</h2>
<p>What I like most about Nha Trang is the beach. It’s only a few minutes away from most parts of the city, so people can swim or walk along the shore almost every day. For me the sea breeze and the sound of the waves make life there very relaxing.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-has-your-hometown-changed-in-recent-years" class="level2" data-number="1.3">
<h2 data-number="1.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-has-your-hometown-changed-in-recent-years"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> How has your hometown changed in recent years?</h2>
<p>In recent years, Nha Trang has developed a lot, especially with tourism. There are many new hotels, resorts, and shopping centers, which make the city look more modern. However, sometimes I feel it has become more crowded and noisy compared to before.</p>
</section>
<section id="is-your-hometown-a-good-place-for-young-people" class="level2" data-number="1.4">
<h2 data-number="1.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="is-your-hometown-a-good-place-for-young-people"><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Is your hometown a good place for young people?</h2>
<p>Yes, I think Nha Trang is a good place for young people. There are many outdoor activities like swimming, diving, or just hanging out by the beach, which are fun and healthy. At the same time, the city is growing, so there are more cafes and entertainment spots where young people can spend time together.</p>

<p>I would like to return to Nha Trang in the future, but maybe not permanently. It’s a beautiful place to relax and enjoy the beach, but I think bigger cities offer more career opportunities. So I imagine myself working elsewhere and coming back to Nha Trang for holiday.</p>

<p>On weekdays I usually wake up around 6:30 in the morning. I like starting my day early because it gives me more time to prepare for studying. Waking up early also makes me feel more productive and focused.</p>

<p>I’m really into documentaries, especially ones about successfully entrepreneurs. There’s a great one about Steve Jobs that I found really inspiring. It talks about his journey building Apple, his innovation ideas, and how he overcame challenges. It made me realize the importance of perseverance and believing in your vision.</p>
<p>Oh!, I’m absolutely fascinated by documentaries, especially those about visionary entrepreneurs. The one on Steve Jobs was truly captivating. It really delved into his relentless drive, his groundbreaking ideas, and how he powered through setbacks. It left me feeling so inspired. Like anything is possible if you’re passionate enough.</p>

<p>I usually watch movies at home with my girlfriend. We love having movie nights where we can relax on the couch, enjoy some snacks, and just unwind after a long day. It’s also great because we have a lot more control over what we watch and can pause whenever we want for bathroom breaks or to grab more popcorn.</p>

<p>I usually watch movies with my girlfriend. We both enjoy going to the cinema when a new horror film is released, but most of the time we watch movies at home because it feels more comfortable and relaxing. It’s a nice way for us to spend time together and share our opinions about the story afterwards.</p>

<p>The last movie I watched was Dune. I really enjoyed it because the visuals were stunning and the atmosphere felt very unique. I also liked how the story mixed science fiction with political themes, which made it more thought-provoking than an ordinary action film.</p>

<p>I usually watch movies about once or twice a week. It depends on how busy I am with my studies, but I try to make time because it helps me relax. Watching a good film is like a short break that keeps me refreshed.</p>

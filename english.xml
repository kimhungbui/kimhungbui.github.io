<h2 data-number="4.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-you-should-learn-from-this-recording"><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> <strong>📘 What you should learn from this recording</strong></h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Be careful with corrections &amp; false starts</strong></p>
<p>– IELTS speakers often say one thing, then correct or add new info. Always wait.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Watch for distractors</strong></p>
<p>– They throw in multiple items (red shirts vs blue shirts, snack vs drink, 190 vs 199).</p>
<p>– You must match exactly to the question.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Numbers are dangerous</strong></p>
<p>– They like to mention a number, then another number → only the final one is correct.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Exact wording matters</strong></p>
<p>– “Reference” ≠ “certificate.” “Story” ≠ “game.” Always take the first correct match.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>IELTS loves practical detail</strong></p>
<p>– Equipment, clothing, times, costs → everyday details are often tested.</p></li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>👉 So, even though you got all correct, the <em>lesson</em> here is:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Don’t answer too quickly.</p></li>
<li><p>Wait to see if the speaker <strong>changes, corrects, or contrasts</strong> the detail.</p></li>
<li><p>When two possible answers appear, IELTS usually wants the <strong>first one mentioned that matches the question</strong>.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Your answer:</strong> A (the increasing risk of accidents)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Correct answer:</strong> B + C (quiet/remote location + difficult weather)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Transcript clue:</strong></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“It’s fine in summer, but can be extremely unpleasant when it’s cold and windy (weather). … But if you like a lively city environment … these jobs are probably not for you – they’re often in pretty remote areas (quiet location). … Standards of health and safety are much higher now … so fewer work-related accidents.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Trap:</strong> You picked “accidents” because it <em>looked logical</em> with outdoor jobs. But the speaker explicitly said <strong>accidents are fewer now</strong>, so that eliminated A.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Your answer:</strong> E (chance to earn more through overtime)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Correct answer:</strong> A (not a permanent job)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Transcript clue:</strong></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“A leading supermarket is looking for a fresh produce buyer who is available for a <strong>12-month maternity cover contract</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Trap:</strong> “Competitive salary” misled you into thinking about money (E). But the <strong>key detail</strong> was “12-month maternity cover” = not permanent.</p></li>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“A year’s experience would be preferred but the company <strong>might be prepared to consider someone who has just completed an appropriate training course</strong>.”</p>

<li><p><strong>Trap:</strong> You overlooked the “experience not essential” phrase. Accommodation (G) appeared elsewhere (farm worker, Q20), so maybe you mis-assigned answers.</p></li>

<h3 data-number="5.0.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-completed-training-course-experience"><span class="header-section-number">5.0.4</span> <strong>Why</strong>&nbsp; <strong>“completed training course” ≠ experience</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Experience</strong> = practical work done in real jobs (on-site, real tasks).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Training course</strong> = education, not real-world job experience.</p></li>
<li><p>The clue is in <strong>contrast</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“A year’s experience would be preferred” (real work)</p></li>
<li><p>“but… might consider training course” (no experience, only training).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>So IELTS wants you to hear that <strong>experience is not essential</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="why-you-thought-it-was-experience" class="level3" data-number="5.0.5">
<h3 data-number="5.0.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-you-thought-it-was-experience"><span class="header-section-number">5.0.5</span> <strong>Why you thought it was experience</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The word <strong>“completed”</strong> misleads. It <em>feels like</em> you “did” something, which is close to work.</p></li>
<li><p>But in IELTS logic: completing a course = <strong>qualification</strong>, not <strong>experience</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="ielts-trick-here" class="level3" data-number="5.0.6">
<h3 data-number="5.0.6" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ielts-trick-here"><span class="header-section-number">5.0.6</span> <strong>IELTS trick here</strong></h3>
<p>They want to see if candidates can <strong>distinguish between “preferred but not essential” vs.&nbsp;“required”</strong>.</p>
<p>So the correct label = <strong>C (experience not essential)</strong>.</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="q20-farm-worker" class="level3" data-number="5.0.7">
<h3 data-number="5.0.7" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="q20-farm-worker"><span class="header-section-number">5.0.7</span> <strong>❌ Q20 – Farm worker</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Your answer:</strong> B (involves leading a team)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Correct answer:</strong> G (accommodation available)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Transcript clue:</strong></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Perks of the job include the <strong>possibility of renting a small cottage on the estate</strong>, and the chance to earn a competitive salary.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Trap:</strong> Maybe rushed here and confused it with “manager roles” that involve leading a team (B). The key signal word: “cottage on the estate” → accommodation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I didn’t know the cottage words i a small house, so i missed it.</p>
<p>small cottage on the estate</p>
<hr>
<p>✅ <strong>Pattern in your mistakes:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>You sometimes <strong>default to common-sense answers</strong> (e.g.&nbsp;accidents, money, leadership) instead of anchoring to the transcript.</p></li>
<li><p>You may <strong>misplace answers</strong> — using a keyword from one job (farm worker) and applying it to another (tree technician).</p></li>
<li><p>You sometimes <strong>stop listening after the first clue</strong> (“competitive salary”) instead of listening for the whole detail.</p></li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>👉 Suggestion for next time:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Always <strong>underline the unique job detail</strong>: maternity cover = not permanent, cottage = accommodation.</p></li>
<li><p>For disadvantages/advantages, <strong>watch for contrasts</strong> (e.g.&nbsp;“health and safety are much higher now” kills option A).</p></li>
<li><p>Use <strong>process of elimination</strong> — ask yourself: “Did she actually say this, or am I assuming?” # Recording 3</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Adam: <em>“It was hard to keep track… I had so many people… had to make sure I kept a proper record”</em></p></li>
<li><p>The distractor = “simple to set up” (B) → ❌ BUT he said it was <em>hard</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Correct answers = <strong>C (large sample)</strong> + <strong>D (subjects unaware)</strong>.</p></li>

<p>🔑 <strong>Tip</strong>: If speaker says <em>“hard / difficult”</em>, never choose “easy / simple”.</p>

<li><p><strong>Trap (Q23–24)</strong>:</p>

<li><p>Rosie: <em>“results problematic… seemed lower than package… probably I didn’t grind enough… scales not accurate enough.”</em></p></li>

<li><p>Correct = <strong>C (not grind finely enough)</strong> + <strong>E (scales unsuitable)</strong>.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Trap (Q25)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Adam: <em>“Items at start/end of menu more likely to be chosen → put low-calorie items there → people will go for them.”</em></p></li>

</ul>
<p>🔑 <strong>Tip</strong>: When they conclude “that will be simpler,” it means <strong>decision is made</strong>.</p>

<p>✅ So your main mistakes (Q26 earlier) happened because:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You mixed up <em>confusing</em> vs <em>inaccurate</em>.</p></li>

<li><p>Correct answer: <strong>equipment</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>📌 Why?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In English, <strong>“equipment” is uncountable</strong> → ❌ no plural “equipments.”</p></li>
<li><p>The speaker said: <em>“…we’re also seeing an increase in the sales figures for knitting_ <strong><em>equipment</em></strong>_.”</em></p></li>
<li><p>IELTS listening tests your <strong>grammar awareness</strong>: even if you hear “equipmentS” in your head, you must know the correct word form.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>👉 <strong>Trap</strong>: They test if you know that some nouns don’t take “s” (e.g.&nbsp;furniture, information, advice, luggage, equipment).</p>
<p><strong>How to avoid next time:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you hear a word that could be uncountable, write it in singular form unless you are 100% sure plural is correct.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="q40-everyday-tasks-like-looking-after-40-were-done-while-knitting." class="level2" data-number="5.11">
<h2 data-number="5.11" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="q40-everyday-tasks-like-looking-after-40-were-done-while-knitting."><span class="header-section-number">5.11</span> <strong>❌ Q40 – “Everyday tasks like looking after (40) ……… were done while knitting.”</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p>You wrote: <strong>sheeps</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Correct answer: <strong>sheep</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>📌 Why?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“Sheep” is <strong>irregular plural</strong> → both singular &amp; plural form is the same.</p></li>
<li><p>The speaker said: <em>“…men, women and children took every opportunity to knit, for example, while watching over_ <strong><em>sheep</em></strong>_.”</em></p></li>
<li><p>IELTS loves to check if you know irregular plurals (sheep, deer, fish, species, etc.).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>👉 <strong>Trap</strong>: You heard the plural idea (many sheep), so you added <strong>s</strong> by instinct. But the rule is: <strong>no “s” for sheep</strong> in plural.</p>
<p><strong>How to avoid next time:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Revise <strong>irregular plurals</strong>: sheep, deer, fish, series, species, offspring, aircraft.</p></li>
<li><p>When in doubt, trust grammar rules — IELTS will never break them.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>✅ So both mistakes were not about <strong>listening</strong> but about <strong>word form &amp; grammar</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Q33 = uncountable noun rule.</p></li>
<li><p>Q40 = irregular plural rule.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Type:</strong> Multiple choice (details about a talk / instructions)</p>
<p><strong>Skills tested:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Recognising paraphrase in distractors</p></li>
<li><p>Listening for <em>specific details</em> rather than topic words</p></li>
<li><p>Maintaining focus during fast option switches</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Common reasons for mistakes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Distractor trap:</strong> The speaker may mention <em>all</em> the options, but only one is true for the context.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Over-reliance on key words:</strong> You may have matched words in the audio directly to the option rather than the meaning.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Losing track in double-question format:</strong> When 2 MCQs come together (like Q11–12), if you miss one small detail for Q11, it can throw off Q12 as well.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fix:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Train to <strong>underline key differences</strong> between options before audio starts.</p></li>
<li><p>Expect <em>paraphrase</em> — options often use synonyms (e.g., “easy to reach” = “accessible”).</p></li>
<li><p>Pause after each answer in practice to mentally “lock” it before moving on.</p></li>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> “Check ethical guidelines for working with (27) …” → Correct answer: <strong>humans/people</strong></p>
<p><strong>Likely reason for mistake:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Plural/singular issue</strong> — you said earlier you tend to miss plural endings in fast speech.</p></li>
<li><p>Possibly misheard as “human research” or “human testing” and didn’t think of the base form “humans.”</p></li>
<li><p>You might have expected a <strong>field/area</strong> (like “psychology” or “participants”) instead of the subject of the research.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fix:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>For plural prediction:</p>
<ul>
<li>After “working with…”, ask: <em>Are they referring to a countable group?</em> If yes → expect plural (humans, students, patients).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>In listening, watch for <strong>/z/ or /s/</strong> endings even when very soft.</p></li>
<li><p>Do “plural ending dictation” drills — play 1–2 second clips, write only the last word, mark plural/singular.</p></li>

<ul>
<li>Total Score: 34/40</li>
<li>Date: 15/08/2025</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="performance-summary" class="level1" data-number="2">
<h1 data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Performance Summary</h1>
<p><strong>Part 1 – Why We Need to Protect Polar Bears</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Accuracy:</strong> 13/13 correct.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Perfect performance in TRUE/FALSE/NOT GIVEN and ONE WORD ONLY tasks. Excellent trap recognition and precise detail matching.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Comment:</strong> Section mastered — no need to adjust approach.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Part 2 – The Step Pyramid of Djoser</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Accuracy:</strong> 5/7 correct — wrong on Q14, Q16, Q20 (<em>Matching Headings</em>).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Error Pattern:</strong> Chose headings based on interesting details rather than the main focus of the paragraph.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Strong in factual detail scanning — all gap-fill and multiple-choice correct.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Next Step:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Summarise paragraph in 3–5 words before looking at heading options.</p></li>
<li><p>Ignore eye-catching details if they are not the paragraph’s central theme.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Part 3 – The Future of Work</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Missed Q27, Q29 (matching opinions) and Q38 (detail).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Q27 &amp; Q29:</strong> Mistakes came from assuming a viewpoint matched a keyword in the text without confirming the <em>speaker</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Q38:</strong> Selected a number mentioned near the topic but not actually answering the question.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Good understanding of main arguments and vocabulary — errors were precision-related, not comprehension-related.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Next Step:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>For matching opinions: underline the <em>speaker’s name</em> and scan for synonyms of their view, not just keywords from the question.</p></li>
<li><p>For figures: re-check the exact question demand (time period, category, or scope) before selecting.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Overall Reading Estimate:</strong> ~34/40 → Band 8.0.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Detail scanning, strong vocabulary comprehension, accurate in TFNG.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Matching Headings (Part 2) and attribution for opinions (Part 3), plus occasional number/date misreads.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Improvement Plan:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>10-min daily drill: 4–5 matching headings + 4–5 matching opinions mixed.</p></li>
<li><p>Weekly “trap review” of number/date questions.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>If you <strong>force yourself after each part</strong> to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Locate the cue</strong> — highlight or underline the exact sentence/phrase in the passage that justifies your answer.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Check it matches the question’s scope</strong> — time frame, subject, and perspective all match.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Check you didn’t use background knowledge</strong> — only the text.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This “cue verification” step will:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Stop heading mistakes (because you’ll see if your heading matches the <em>whole</em> paragraph, not just a detail).</p></li>
<li><p>Stop opinion mix-ups (you’ll confirm the cue is linked to the right person).</p></li>
<li><p>Stop number/date errors (you’ll double-check it’s the one the question asked for).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It might add <strong>2–3 minutes per section</strong> in practice now, but by test day it will be automatic.</p>

<section id="part-1" class="level1" data-number="3">
<h1 data-number="3"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Part 1</h1>
<section id="true-false-not-given-questions-17-analysis-traps" class="level2" data-number="3.1">
<h2 data-number="3.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="true-false-not-given-questions-17-analysis-traps"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> <strong>True / False / Not Given (Questions 1–7) — analysis &amp; traps</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Q1.</strong> <em>Polar bears suffer from various health problems due to the build-up of fat under their skin.</em> — <strong>FALSE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Why:</strong> Passage says humans with similar fat would be obese and get diabetes/heart disease <strong>but</strong> “the polar bear experiences no such consequences.” That directly contradicts the statement.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trap:</strong> The text compares humans → distracts you into thinking fat = illness. Always check who the comparison refers to.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q2.</strong> <em>The study done by Liu and his colleagues compared different groups of polar bears.</em> — <strong>FALSE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Why:</strong> The study compared <strong>polar bears with brown bears</strong> (their relatives in warmer climates), not different groups of polar bears.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trap:</strong> The word <em>compared</em> appears — setters try to trick you by changing the comparison object (groups of polar bears vs.&nbsp;polar vs.&nbsp;brown).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q3.</strong> <em>Liu and colleagues were the first researchers to compare polar bears and brown bears genetically.</em> — <strong>NOT GIVEN</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Why:</strong> The passage reports the study and its findings but <strong>does not say</strong> whether they were the first to do such a comparison. No info = NOT GIVEN.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trap:</strong> “First” is a strong claim — absence of explicit wording = NOT GIVEN.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q4.</strong> <em>Polar bears are able to control their levels of bad cholesterol by genetic means.</em> — <strong>TRUE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Why:</strong> Liu et al.&nbsp;found a gene (APoB) in polar bears that reduces LDL (“bad” cholesterol). The statement paraphrases that genetic basis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trap:</strong> Watch words like <em>control</em> — here it’s acceptable because the passage attributes the LDL reduction to a gene.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q5.</strong> <em>Female polar bears are able to survive for about six months without food.</em> — <strong>TRUE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Why:</strong> The passage explicitly describes ~six months of fasting in maternity dens. That matches “survive…without food.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trap:</strong> None big — exact phrase appears.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q6.</strong> <em>It was found that the bones of female polar bears were very weak when they came out of their dens in spring.</em> — <strong>FALSE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Why:</strong> The study found <strong>no evidence of significant loss of bone density</strong> when they emerged. The statement says the opposite.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trap:</strong> Be careful with negative wording (“no evidence” vs “very weak”) — they flip meaning.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q7.</strong> <em>The polar bear’s mechanism for increasing bone density could also be used by people one day.</em> — <strong>TRUE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Why:</strong> The passage: <em>“If the mechanism … can be understood, many bedridden humans, and even astronauts, could potentially benefit.”</em> That directly supports the statement.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trap:</strong> “Could be used” is hypothetical — passage uses the same conditional; therefore TRUE.</p></li>

<p>You answered: <strong>8 VIOLENT, 9 TOOL, 10 MEAT, 11 PHOTOGRAPHER, 12 GAME, 13 FRUSTRATION.</strong> All correct. Here’s why and what to watch for.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Q8 VIOLENT</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Where:</strong> “Bears… seem to be perceived as stupid and in many cases violent.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trap:</strong> Passage also uses <em>stupid</em> — the question asks for the contrasting perception, so <strong>violent</strong> is the precise word.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Q9 TOOL</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Where:</strong> Tennoji Zoo — “used a tree branch on multiple occasions to dislodge a piece of meat…” → branch used as a <strong>tool</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trap:</strong> Could be tempted by synonyms like “instrument” — but the exam demands the word used in the text (TOOL).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Q10 MEAT</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Where:</strong> The branch was used “to dislodge a piece of <strong>meat</strong> hung out of his reach.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trap:</strong> “Food” or “prey” are possible distractors, but MEAT is the exact word used.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Q11 PHOTOGRAPHER</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Where:</strong> Wild bear “ran and jumped onto barrels in an attempt to get to a <strong>photographer</strong> standing on a platform four metres high.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trap:</strong> Don’t pick “platform” — the question asks who was on the platform (photographer).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Q12 GAME</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Where:</strong> Annes observed bears “putting objects in piles and then knocking them over in what appeared to be a <strong>game</strong>.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trap:</strong> “Play” is tempting, but the passage says <strong>game</strong> — and the instruction required ONE WORD ONLY.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Q13 FRUSTRATION</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Where:</strong> “They may make movements suggesting <strong>frustration</strong> if disappointed when hunting.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trap:</strong> “Anger” or “aggression” could seem plausible, but <strong>frustration</strong> is the explicit emotion named.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Find the exact sentence that relates to the statement</strong> — you did this well. TFNG requires reference-level precision, not general sense.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Watch comparisons carefully</strong> (Q1, Q2). The passage often compares species or humans — note exactly who the comparison applies to.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be wary of “first / always / never / all”</strong> claims — these often lead to NOT GIVEN or FALSE unless explicitly stated.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use the passage wording for table completions.</strong> The exam usually expects the exact word or an obvious synonym used in the text; because you used the words actually in the passage, you were correct.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Single-word answers:</strong> follow the instructions strictly — ONE WORD ONLY, correct form. (e.g., GAME not “playing”.)</p></li>

<h2 data-number="5.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="q14-paragraph-a"><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> <strong>Q14 — Paragraph A</strong></h2>
<p><strong>You chose:</strong> VI (pyramid design others copied) — <strong>Wrong</strong></p>
<p><strong>Correct:</strong> IV</p>
<p><strong>Why IV?</strong></p>
<p>Paragraph A is saying: “There’s long debate about pyramid evolution, but <em>one</em> certain fact remains — it began with this single monument designed by one architect.” That is literally <em>one certainty among other less definite facts</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Key cue:</strong> <em>“However, there is no question that… it began with one monument … designed by one brilliant architect.”</em> → main idea = a single certainty.</p>
<p><strong>Why VI is tempting but wrong:</strong> VI (others copied the design) is true for the passage overall, but Paragraph A is not about later pyramids copying Djoser’s — it’s about the <em>certainty that the pyramid story begins here</em>. The “copy” idea is stated later (paragraph G).</p>

<p><strong>You chose:</strong> IV — <strong>Wrong</strong></p>
<p><strong>Correct:</strong> II (A difficult task for those involved)</p>
<p><strong>Why II?</strong></p>
<p>Paragraph C describes <em>experimentation</em> and <em>construction challenges</em>: multiple plans, weight issues, inward inclines to prevent collapse. The emphasis is on the <strong>builders’ challenge</strong> and difficulty.</p>
<p><strong>Key cue:</strong> <em>“Much experimentation was involved… The weight of the enormous mass was a challenge for the builders…”</em> → main idea = difficulty of the task.</p>
<p><strong>Why IV was tempting but wrong:</strong> Paragraph C discusses construction stages, but the focus is the <strong>practical difficulty</strong>, not a “single certainty” like paragraph A. So II fits better.</p>

<p><strong>You chose:</strong> II — <strong>Wrong</strong></p>
<p><strong>Correct:</strong> VI (A pyramid design that others copied)</p>
<p><strong>Why VI?</strong></p>
<p>Paragraph G explicitly states the Step Pyramid’s <em>revolutionary</em> role and that it became the <strong>archetype</strong> other pyramid builders followed.</p>
<p><strong>Key cue:</strong> <em>“this pyramid complex constitutes a milestone… The Step Pyramid was a revolutionary advance … became the archetype which all the other great pyramid builders of Egypt would follow.”</em> → main idea = copied/imitated design.</p>
<p><strong>Why II was tempting but wrong:</strong> Paragraph G praises importance and influence; it doesn’t emphasise difficulty. The “challenge” language was in paragraph C.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Read the paragraph before looking at headings.</strong></p>
<p>Form a 3–5 word summary of the <em>main idea</em> (not details).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Check the topic sentence (first or last sentence).</strong></p>
<p>IELTS paragraphs often signal the main idea there.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Match meaning, not words.</strong></p>
<p>Headings use paraphrase. Look for synonyms and concept-level matches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Compare scope.</strong></p>
<p>Headings that sound correct but are <em>too narrow</em> (detail) or <em>too broad</em> can be rejected.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Eliminate distractors that match only one example.</strong></p>
<p>If a heading matches just one sentence or example, it’s likely a trap.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use process of elimination.</strong></p>
<p>If two headings seem possible, prefer the one that covers the <em>entire</em> paragraph.</p></li>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> The first paragraph tells us about…</p>
<p><strong>Why wrong:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>You were distracted by the mention of <em>embodied AI</em> vs <em>disembodied AI</em> in the paragraph, which matches option <strong>D</strong> superficially.</p></li>
<li><p>The real focus of the first paragraph was <strong>how AI will alter the nature of work</strong> — global workforce adaptation, job switching, evolving occupations — not the differences between AI types.</p></li>
<li><p>Mention of embodied vs disembodied AI was an <em>example</em>, not the main message.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lesson:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Look for the main idea of the paragraph, not interesting side points.</strong> In IELTS, side points often match wrong options perfectly (distractor trap).</p></li>
<li><p>Strategy: Before looking at the options, summarise the paragraph in <strong>5 words</strong> in your head, then match the option that fits.</p></li>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> What did Pachidi observe at the telecommunications company?</p>
<p><strong>Why wrong:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>You probably saw that staff were “dependent” on the algorithm and linked it to “allowing AI to carry out tasks they ought to do themselves” (D).</p></li>
<li><p>But the key detail in the passage: <em>“workers feed the algorithm with false data to reach their targets”</em> — this is actively <strong>manipulating the AI</strong> to get the result they want → <strong>C</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>D is too passive; the staff were active in <em>making sure AI produced desired results</em>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lesson:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>In “what did they observe” questions, <strong>focus on the concrete action</strong> observed, not the general behaviour.</p></li>
<li><p>Strategy: Underline verbs showing action in the text — that’s usually what the correct answer will reflect.</p></li>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> It is important to be aware of the range of problems that AI causes.</p>
<p><strong>Why wrong:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>C (Ewan McGaughey) talks about policy and social reform, but <strong>awareness of problems</strong> was actually from Pachidi’s perspective: “We need to make sure we fully understand the dilemmas that this new world raises…”</p></li>
<li><p>You may have been matching the idea of “problems” with “unemployment” in McGaughey’s section, but that’s too narrow.</p></li>
<li><p>The original statement is broader — “dilemmas” = a <em>range</em> of potential problems.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lesson:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>When matching researchers, look for the <em>scope</em> of the statement: if the question says “range of problems”, check whether the person talks broadly or narrowly.</p></li>
<li><p>Strategy: Mark in the margin the “theme” each researcher covers, so you can match later without rereading everything.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>
<p>Your mistakes come from <strong>picking the tempting partial match</strong> instead of the <em>most complete match to the main idea</em>.</p>
<p>This is <strong>classic for Band 8–8.5 readers</strong> — the jump to Band 9 means getting ruthless about:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Main idea extraction</p></li>
<li><p>Exact action identification</p></li>
<li><p>Scope matching</p></li>

<p><strong>Paragraph A</strong></p>
<p>Although its exact beginnings are debated, many believe the practice of carving stone animals began in this region over 2,000 years ago. Others claim it started elsewhere and was imported by travelling merchants.</p>
<p>iii</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph B</strong></p>
<p>The main temple is surrounded by courtyards, gardens, and ceremonial halls. Nearby are the living quarters of the high priests, with tall walls separating the inner sanctum from the outer city.</p>

<p><strong>Paragraph C</strong></p>
<p>The architect initially proposed a round structure, but later changed it to a square base for stability. Several more alterations followed before the final, striking form was approved.</p>
<p>x</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph D</strong></p>
<p>Built on an island and ringed with high walls, the fortress was accessible only through a narrow bridge. Hidden chambers and false passageways made it even harder for intruders to reach the treasure room.</p>
<p>ii</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph E</strong></p>
<p>The king was so impressed by the design that he insisted his adviser’s name be engraved on the main gate alongside his own — an unusual break from tradition.</p>
<p>iv</p>

<p>After months of trial and error, the builders finally found a way to balance the massive roof slabs without them collapsing under their own weight.</p>

<p>During excavation, researchers found dozens of clay jars with inscriptions they could not decipher. The jars’ purpose remains a mystery, and experts still debate their meaning today.</p>

<p>💡 <strong>Your Task</strong>: Match each paragraph (A–H) with one heading (i–x).</p>

<h1 data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Performance Summary</h1>
<p>All my mistakes in that test were related to singular/plural prediction.</p>
<p>Today i get 37/40 ielts, all wrong in plural/singular, I can learn the acceptance/decline type question in task 3 of the previous test, and do the test correctly</p>
<p>I think maps in listening is my advantage, i can look at the map and easier to think and hear.</p>
</section>
<section id="recording-1" class="level1" data-number="3">
<h1 data-number="3"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Recording 1</h1>
<p>It looks like your mistake in <strong>Q8</strong> (“WEDNESDAY” vs.&nbsp;“WEDNESDAYS”) comes down to a common IELTS listening trap — <strong>plural vs.&nbsp;singular forms</strong>.</p>
<p>Here’s why:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Exact wording in the audio</strong></p>
<p>Sarah says:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“…so we moved them to <strong>Wednesdays</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>She’s talking about the <em>recurring schedule</em>, meaning <em>every Wednesday</em>, so the plural form is grammatically correct.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Why singular “Wednesday” is wrong</strong></p>
<p>IELTS marking is strict — the answer must match exactly what’s said in the recording (spelling and plurality included).</p>
<p>Even though “Wednesday” might make sense to you as a day, it’s not what the speaker said, so it’s marked wrong.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Key listening clue</strong></p>
<p>When you hear a <strong>day of the week</strong> in plural form, it usually means a repeated weekly event:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“Classes are on Mondays.” (every Monday)</p></li>
<li><p>“Meetings take place on Fridays.” (every Friday)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Tip to avoid this mistake</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>When listening, always pay attention to <strong>-s</strong> endings on days, months, and nouns.</p></li>
<li><p>In notes completion tasks, write <em>exactly</em> what you hear, even if you think the singular sounds more natural.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>In natural English, that final /s/ is often very soft or blended into the next word, so it’s almost invisible unless you train your ear.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can <em>predict</em> plural vs.&nbsp;singular even when you don’t hear the sound clearly:</p>
<hr>
<section id="use-grammar-logic" class="level3" data-number="3.0.1">
<h3 data-number="3.0.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="use-grammar-logic"><span class="header-section-number">3.0.1</span> <strong>Use grammar logic</strong></h3>
<p>Look at the sentence structure and the verb form.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Plural</strong> → often with plural verbs:</p>
<p>“We moved them to <strong>Wednesdays</strong>.” → <em>them</em> = many classes → must be plural days.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Singular</strong> → often with “this” or “next”:</p>
<p>“It’s on <strong>Wednesday</strong> next week.” (one time only)</p></li>
</ul>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="listen-for-context" class="level3" data-number="3.0.2">
<h3 data-number="3.0.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="listen-for-context"><span class="header-section-number">3.0.2</span> <strong>Listen for context</strong></h3>
<p>Ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Is this talking about a <strong>regular schedule</strong>? → plural.</p></li>
<li><p>Is it a <strong>single event</strong>? → singular.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In Q8’s case, they were talking about the <em>regular weekly class</em>, so “Wednesdays” fits.</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="watch-for-connecting-sounds" class="level3" data-number="3.0.3">
<h3 data-number="3.0.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="watch-for-connecting-sounds"><span class="header-section-number">3.0.3</span> <strong>Watch for connecting sounds</strong></h3>
<p>Native speakers link words:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“on Wednesdays at ten” might sound like <strong>“on Wenzdaysat ten”</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>The /s/ merges into the “at” sound, so you don’t hear it as a separate hiss.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can train your ear by slowing down recordings (0.75x speed) and replaying just the day-of-week phrases.</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="use-prediction-before-the-audio" class="level3" data-number="3.0.4">
<h3 data-number="3.0.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="use-prediction-before-the-audio"><span class="header-section-number">3.0.4</span> <strong>4. Use prediction before the audio</strong></h3>
<p>Before listening, scan the notes:</p>
<p>If you see “Held on (8) ______ from 10 am to 11 am” and the topic is weekly workshops → 80% chance it’s plural.</p>

<li><p><strong>Q15 – Coffee room</strong></p>
<ul>

<li><p><strong>Q16 – Warehouse</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>“Next to factory.”</p></li>
<li><p>“Accessed by lorries … <strong>turning area</strong> at the end.”</p></li>

</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Q17 – Staff canteen</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>“<strong>Right next to reception</strong>.”</p></li>
<li><p>Views are <strong>poor</strong> (corridor/courtyard or access road).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trap:</strong> choosing a room with nice view; forgetting the “next to reception” anchor.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Q18 – Meeting room</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>“Walk along corridor <strong>to the left of the courtyard</strong> → <strong>to the end</strong> → <strong>last on the right</strong>.”</p></li>
<li><p>“<strong>No natural daylight</strong>.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trap:</strong> selecting any right‑hand room; missing “<strong>last</strong> on the right.”</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Q19 – Human Resources</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>“At the <strong>front</strong> of this building.”</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Mutual agreement filter</strong> – If question says “both agree,” check that both speakers confirm it (even briefly).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Change vs already done</strong> – For proposal questions, “change” means new modification, not something they completed earlier.</p></li>

<p>I’m wrong in 39 and 40, both in plural/singular prediction.</p>
<p>☑️&nbsp;In&nbsp;business,&nbsp;people&nbsp;benefit&nbsp;from&nbsp;Stoicism&nbsp;by&nbsp;identifying&nbsp;obstacles&nbsp;as&nbsp;<strong>(39)</strong>&nbsp;……………………….. .</p>

<p>Let’s break down why <strong>Q39</strong> and <strong>Q40</strong> were <em>singular</em> despite your prediction:</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“…Stoics teach <strong>turning obstacles into opportunity</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Why singular?</strong></p>
<p>“Opportunity” here is an <em>uncountable concept</em> — like “freedom” or “happiness.”</p>
<p>The idea is that <em>all obstacles together</em> can be transformed into <em>the general idea of opportunity</em>, not multiple individual opportunities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Plural trap:</strong></p>
<p>The plural “obstacles” nearby makes our brain want symmetry (“opportunities”), but grammar meaning overrules symmetry here.</p></li>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“It requires a lot of practice, but Stoicism can help people…”</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Why singular?</strong></p>
<p>“Practice” here is uncountable (meaning <em>the act of practising</em>).</p>
<p>Uncountable nouns don’t take plural even after “a lot of.”</p>
<p>Compare:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“a lot of work” ✅ (uncountable)</p></li>
<li><p>“a lot of books” ✅ (countable plural)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Plural trap:</strong></p>
<p>We’re trained to think “a lot of” = plural, but it only does that with countable nouns. ### <strong>The takeaway skill</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>When predicting plural/singular in listening:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Check the noun type</strong> in your head:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Countable →</strong> can be plural (“opportunities”) or singular (“opportunity”).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Uncountable →</strong> always singular form (“practice”).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Don’t be misled by nearby plurals</strong> — they don’t force the answer to match.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Listen for context meaning</strong>: Are they talking about <em>a general idea</em> or <em>individual items</em>?</p></li>

<p><strong>Transcript:</strong></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Stoics teach turning obstacles into opportunity.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>Here the word is <strong>singular</strong> (“opportunity”) because it’s talking about the general idea of <strong>seeing challenges as a single type of positive outcome</strong>, not listing multiple separate chances.</p></li>
<li><p>In IELTS listening, when the speaker uses <strong>into opportunity</strong> (no “an” or “the”), it’s usually uncountable or general — same as “into gold” or “into power.”</p></li>
<li><p>If it were plural, you’d hear a clearer “opportunities,” with a small /z/ sound at the end.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong></p>
<p>If the word follows <strong>“into”</strong> and is used conceptually, lean towards singular.</p>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>Here it’s <strong>uncountable</strong> — meaning “a lot of doing something to improve a skill,” not “different methods” (which would be “practices”).</p></li>
<li><p>In IELTS listening, <strong>considerable</strong> often precedes uncountable nouns like “time,” “effort,” “practice,” “work.”</p></li>
<li><p>Plural “practices” would refer to “customs” or “ways of doing things” — different meaning.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong></p>
<p>If preceded by <strong>a lot of</strong>, <strong>considerable</strong>, <strong>much</strong>, <strong>little</strong>, or <strong>some</strong>, the noun is likely uncountable and singular.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>Nature of the mistake</li>
</ol>
<p>You wrote “STEUNFIRTS” instead of “STAUNFIRTH”.</p>
<p>This is a spelling accuracy issue in a Listening Form Completion question.</p>
<p>The audio clearly spelled it out: S-T-A-U-N-F-I-R-T-H.</p>
<p>You transposed letters (“E” instead of “A” and “S” instead of “H”).</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Why it happened</li>
</ol>
<p>Spelling under pressure: In IELTS Listening, names—especially unusual ones—often trip people up because they’re not in everyday vocabulary.</p>
<p>Letter confusion:</p>
<p>“AU” sound in “Staun-” might have sounded like “EU” to you.</p>
<p>Final “-th” might have sounded like “-ts” due to accent or fast pronunciation.</p>
<p>Not actively writing while hearing the spelling: If you only listen without visualising the word in your head letter-by-letter, errors creep in.</p>
<p>No quick check: Since the speaker spelled it, you could have matched your writing to the audio in real time.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Skills involved</li>
</ol>
<p>Spelling unusual words (especially names and place names)</p>
<p>Listening to letter sequences accurately</p>
<p>Linking sounds to correct English letter combinations (AU, TH, etc.)</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>How to avoid in future</li>
</ol>
<p>When a word is spelled in the audio:</p>
<p>Write each letter as you hear it—don’t try to write the whole word from memory first.</p>
<p>Say the letters in your head as you write (S…T…A…U…N…).</p>
<p>Check letter order before moving on.</p>
<p>Practice listening to spelled words:</p>
<p>Names: towns, people, brands</p>
<p>Especially with British accents, since “A” might sound like “eh” and “U” like “yoo” or “uh”.</p>
<p>Know common UK place name patterns:</p>
<p>“-th” endings, “AU” in “Staun-”, “-firth” meaning estuary. # Recording 2</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Q21 (detail meaning):</strong> You chose the <strong>topic around it</strong> (location/creation) rather than the <strong>new information</strong> signaled by “<strong>didn’t realise</strong>”. In IELTS Listening, phrases like <em>didn’t realise / I learned / I found out</em> point to the <strong>answerable discovery</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Q25 (speaker assignment):</strong> It’s an <strong>ownership</strong> trap. The test uses soft language: <em>“I could do that… unless…”</em> + acceptance <em>“That’s fine by me.”</em> → That confirms the first speaker <strong>keeps</strong> the task.</p></li>

<p>Patterns behind these mistakes (and how to fix them fast)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Plurals in Note Completion</li>
</ol>
<p>Cues for plural: were / include(d) / many / a number of / large numbers of.</p>
<p>Grammar check: If the clause around the blank has plural verbs/pronouns, your answer should likely be plural.</p>
<p>Collocations: access to newspapers (plural), new machines (plural).</p>
<p>Micro-drill (plural or singular?)</p>
<p>“There were several ___ installed last year.” → machines</p>
<p>“The rail network included ___ that carried adverts.” → newspapers</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>Why this happened</p>
<p>The phrase “goods for sale” appears right next to “improved lighting” in the audio. Your brain probably latched onto sale as the keyword, but the note’s blank is asking for the cause (improved lighting), not the object (goods).</p>
<p>This is a classic IELTS distractor — they place the correct word just before or after another tempting one.</p>
<p>Identify the blank’s role before listening — here it’s a cause in a “because of better ___” structure.</p>
<p>Mark function words in your notes: “better ___” → adjective + noun = likely a thing or quality, not an action.</p>
<p>Separate main idea from examples — “improved lighting” (main cause) … “goods for sale” (example).</p>
<p>35 – “New 35 … made factories necessary…”</p>
<p>Clue: “New ___ made factories necessary” → The verb made is plural-form agreement?</p>
<p>Not exactly — here, the sentence subject is “New ___” which could be singular or plural.</p>
<p>Logic clue: The text talks about “enormous new machines” (plural) producing goods faster. This isn’t one single invention, it’s a category of inventions.</p>
<p>Prediction: Likely plural because they’re talking about many different machines, not a single machine.</p>
<p>Plural signal: “Factories” (plural) + “people moved into towns” = scale effect → multiple pieces of machinery.</p>
<p>✅ Correct form: machines</p>
<p>36 – “… greater access to 36 ___ made people more aware…”</p>
<p>Clue: “greater access to ___ made people more aware” — here, access to usually takes an uncountable or plural countable noun.</p>
<p>Logic clue: They’re talking about railways transporting “newspapers” (plural) so thousands of people could read them.</p>
<p>Plural signal: “Greater access” suggests many copies/items, not a single publication. One newspaper wouldn’t reach “thousands” → must be plural.</p>
<p>✅ Correct form: newspapers</p>
<p>General Tips to Predict Plural in IELTS Listening</p>
<p>Look at the article/determiner before the blank:</p>
<p>“a/an” → singular</p>
<p>“the” / no article → could be plural or uncountable</p>
<p>“these / those / many / several” → plural</p>
<p>Check verb agreement if the blank is the subject:</p>
<p>Plural noun → plural verb (“are”, “make”)</p>
<p>Ask: Is it one thing or a category?</p>
<p>Broad concepts or lists → often plural.</p>
<p>Listen for plural -s / -z sound in the audio. Train your ear for it — IELTS often hides it in fast speech.</p>
<p>Think about realism: If the statement is about widespread change, plural is more logical.</p>

<p>Q15:</p>
<p>Alice says:</p>
<p>“Absolutely – we want to include all kids in the city – especially those who live on busy roads. It’s here that demand is greatest. Obviously, there isn’t such demand in wealthier areas… or in the suburbs where there are usually more places for children to play outside.”</p>
<p>Key phrases: “busy roads” and “demand is greatest.”</p>
<p>Interpretation: “most needed” (question wording) = where demand is greatest → that is areas with heavy traffic = option C.</p>
<p>Why the other options are wrong</p>
<p>A (wealthy areas) — contradicted directly: “there isn’t such demand in wealthier areas…”</p>
<p>B (quiet suburban areas) — contradicted directly: suburbs usually have more places for children to play, so demand is lower, not highest.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Likely reasons you chose the wrong answer</li>
</ol>
<p>You may have misheard “busy roads” (it’s easy to miss short phrases).</p>
<p>You may have focused on the nearby mention of “wealthier areas” or “suburbs” and confused the meaning (these are comparisons, not the location where demand is greatest).</p>
<p>You may not have linked the paraphrase: “demand is greatest” ↔︎ “most needed.”</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>How to avoid this kind of mistake (practical tips)</li>
</ol>
<p>Read question + options BEFORE the audio — underline key words: most needed, wealthy, suburbs, heavy traffic.</p>
<p>Predict: think what type of place/word you expect to hear (here: a place where children lack play spaces).</p>
<p>Listen for signal words: especially, it’s here that…, there isn’t… — they show emphasis/contrast.</p>
<p>Map paraphrases: match “busy roads” → “areas with heavy traffic”; “demand is greatest” → “most needed.”</p>
<p>Eliminate contradictions: if the speaker immediately says “there isn’t such demand…”, cross that option out.</p>
<p>Take a tiny note (one or two words) at the moment you hear the key phrase — e.g., write “busy roads / demand ↑”.</p>
<p>Don’t get distracted by other nearby details — check the exact sentence containing the answer.</p>
<p>I miss the word ’’isn’t such”, i hear that demand is greatest ….- &gt; wealthier areas</p>
<p>busy road -&gt; heavy traffic # Recording 3</p>
<p>Firstly, i choose STRUCTURE, i fix it to HOOK, i think the word ‘PROMINENT’ is like the hook ?</p>
<p>Quick transcript evidence (exact lines)</p>
<p>For Q24: Tom says “you’ll need to look at how the item is put together: what structure is it given? Bear in mind that not many people read beyond the first paragraph, so what has the journalist put at the beginning? And if, say, three are conflicting opinions… does one appear near the end…”</p>
<p>For Q25: Tom says “what’s the writer’s purpose, or at least the most important one… It may seem to be to inform the public, but often it’s that they want to create fear, or controversy, or to make somebody look ridiculous.”</p>
<p>Why Q24 = STRUCTURE, not HOOK</p>
<p>What the question asked: “the 24 … of the item, e.g.&nbsp;what’s made prominent” → this is about how the article is organised (order, emphasis, placement).</p>
<p>Tom’s exact word was structure (“how the item is put together”). That matches the required answer.</p>
<p>Why HOOK is wrong: a hook is only the attention‑grabbing opening/lead. The question is broader — it asks about the whole organisation/layout (where things are placed, what’s prominent), not just the opening line.</p>
<p>Takeaway: if the speaker talks about beginning / where opinions appear / what is prominent, the intended word is structure (organising principle), not just hook.</p>
<p>Why Q25 = PURPOSE, not OPINION</p>
<p>What Tom asked you to find: “what’s the writer’s purpose… It may seem to be to inform… often it’s that they want to create fear, or controversy…” — these are intentions/aims (to inform, to upset, to ridicule). That’s purpose.</p>
<p>Why OPINION is wrong: Opinion = the writer’s view or stance on the subject (what they think). This is related but different: purpose = why they wrote it; opinion = what they think.</p>
<p>Tip: Listen for verbs/phrases like “to inform”, “to create fear”, “to make somebody look…” — these signal purpose/aim, not merely opinion.</p>
<p>Practical listening tips to avoid these mistakes</p>
<p>Listen for the exact phrasing. Exam writers often use the same word (e.g., structure, purpose). If you hear it, use it.</p>
<p>Map categories, not single features. Decide whether the speaker talks about organisation (structure), intention (purpose), viewpoint (opinion) or technique/device (hook/headline/graphic).</p>
<p>Spot signal words:</p>
<p>Structure → put together, beginning, end, first paragraph, prominent, what is made prominent</p>
<p>Purpose → to inform, to persuade, to create fear/controversy, want to…</p>
<p>Opinion → believes, thinks, argues, suggests</p>
<p>Hook → attention, grab, lead, opening line</p>
<p>Predict the word type before listening (noun/adjective/plural). That helps you choose between similar options.</p>
<p>Underline/mark the question phrase (e.g., “what … of the item”) so you know whether it asks for organisation, intention, or content.</p>
<p>Small practice (quick drill)</p>
<p>Read these short cues and say which label fits: STRUCTURE / PURPOSE / OPINION / HOOK</p>
<p>“They put the critical detail in paragraph five, where few read.” → STRUCTURE</p>
<p>“The article seems designed to alarm readers about rising costs.” → PURPOSE</p>
<p>“The journalist argues that schools are underfunded.” → OPINION</p>
<p>“The opening sentence uses a shocking fact to grab attention.” → HOOK</p>
</section>
<section id="recording-4" class="level1" data-number="5">
<h1 data-number="5"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Recording 4</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li>Exact evidence from the transcript</li>
</ol>
<p>The sentence reads:</p>
<p>“A major step toward large‑scale commercial soapmaking occurred in 1791, when a French chemist, Nicholas Leblanc, patented a process for turning salt into soda ash (Q38), or sodium carbonate.”</p>
<p>So the speaker explicitly says “turning salt into soda ash.” The word you must fill is SALT.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Why your answer “SOAPS” is wrong</li>
</ol>
<p>Doesn’t match the spoken phrase. The speaker mentions soap several times elsewhere, which can be a distractor, but here the verb phrase is “turning ___ into …” — the thing being turned into soda ash is salt, not soap.</p>
<p>Makes no logical sense in context. Soda ash (sodium carbonate) is an alkali used to make soap; you don’t make soda ash from soap. The passage later explains that soda ash combines with fat to form soap — so soap comes after, not before.</p>
<p>Grammatical fit. The notes ask “making soda ash from ___” so the missing word is a raw material (a substance): salt fits perfectly.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>How this mistake likely happened</li>
</ol>
<p>You heard nearby words like soap / soapmaking and jumped to that as the answer (a common trap).</p>
<p>You may have missed the short but crucial phrase “turning salt into…”, or mis-copied during note-taking.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>How to avoid this in future (practical tips)</li>
</ol>
<p>Pre‑read the question and predict the type of word needed (here: a substance/noun).</p>
<p>Listen for connecting words like into / from / by — they show transformation or source. (“turning X into Y” → X is the source).</p>
<p>Underline nearby keywords in the transcript while listening (e.g., turning…into, soda ash).</p>
<p>Don’t be fooled by repeated topic words (e.g., soap). Check the exact sentence for the answer.</p>
<p>Take minimal notes (1–2 letters) of the key word when you hear it — faster than trying to write the whole word immediately.</p>
<p>If you’re unsure, use logic: ask whether the proposed answer makes sense in the sequence described (what comes before and after).</p>

<p>IELTS Speaking Part 2 – Cue Card Sample</p>
<p>❓Describe an exhibition or display you have seen that left an impression on you.</p>
<p>You should say:</p>
<p>What the exhibition was about</p>
<p>Where you saw it</p>
<p>What was on display</p>
<p>And explain why it left an impression on you</p>
<p>Last year, I went to a university open day, and there was a very interesting exhibition about British literature in the 19th century, focusing on Charles Dickens. It was prepared by students from the English department, and it showed how Dickens’s novels were connected to life in that time.</p>
<p>The display had big posters with summaries of some of his books like Oliver Twist, Bleak House, and Nicholas Nickleby. Each book had a theme. For example, Oliver Twist was used to show poverty and how poor children didn’t go to school. Nicholas Nickleby had some parts about entertainment, because it mentioned a group of actors. There were also quotes from the books and short explanations about social problems.</p>
<p>What impressed me was how literature could help people learn about the past. I always thought novels were just stories, but this exhibition showed me that they can also talk about important social issues, like education, justice, and even women’s lives. I think it was a very creative and meaningful way to present history.</p>
<p>Do you think literature can still influence society today?</p>
<p>Band 7 Answer:</p>
<p>Yes, I think so. Literature helps people see the problems in society. Even today, many writers talk about topics like racism, poverty, or climate change. These books make people think, and maybe change their opinions. Like in the past, Dickens used his novels to show people how poor families lived, and some authors do similar things today.</p>
<p>❓Why do some authors choose to write about social issues?</p>
<p>Band 7 Answer:</p>
<p>I believe they want to help or teach people. Some writers care about problems in society, so they use their books to talk about them. It’s a way to send a message, and maybe make people care more. For example, Dickens wanted people to know about the bad conditions for poor people, and that’s why he showed those things in his books.</p>
<p>❓Do you think historical literature is still relevant today?</p>
<p>Band 7 Answer:</p>
<p>Yes, I think old books still have value. Even if the language is old, the ideas are similar. Many stories talk about things we still see today, like unfair laws, rich and poor people, or family problems. Also, reading historical books can help us understand the culture and life in the past.</p>
</section>
<section id="topic-rural-development-sustainability" class="level2" data-number="7.2">
<h2 data-number="7.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="topic-rural-development-sustainability"><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Topic: Rural Development &amp; Sustainability</h2>
<p><strong>Question 1: What are the biggest challenges facing rural areas in developing countries?</strong></p>
<p>Band 7 Answer:</p>
<p>I think one of the main challenges is the lack of water. In dry or arid areas, people can’t grow enough crops because there’s no dependable water supply. Another problem is transportation. Farmers sometimes grow produce, but they can’t get it to the market, so it gets spoiled. Also, I think there are not enough jobs, so people rely too much on natural resources like forests, for example cutting trees to make charcoal, which is not sustainable.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>One major challenge is definitely access to water, especially in regions that are dry and arid. Without a dependable water supply, it’s incredibly difficult to support agriculture, which is often the main source of income. Another issue is the lack of infrastructure — things like roads and transport systems — which makes it hard for farmers to get their produce to market. As a result, a lot of food ends up being spoiled. I’d also say that over-reliance on natural resources, like cutting down trees for charcoal, leads to environmental degradation, which is not sustainable in the long run</p>
<p><strong>Question 2: What kinds of development programmes are most effective in rural communities?</strong></p>
<p>Programmes that support agriculture are really useful. For example, if there is a river nearby, they can build irrigation systems to help with farming. I also think helping people learn new techniques like food preservation or fish farming can make a big difference. It’s better when the community is involved and provides labour because that makes them feel responsible.</p>
<p>Programs that focus on sustainable farming practices tend to be the most effective. For instance, setting up irrigation systems using nearby rivers can make a huge difference in crop production. It’s also important to involve the local community directly. When people contribute their own labour or make suggestions — like introducing beekeeping or fish farming — they’re more invested in the success of the project. I think combining technical support with community engagement creates the best outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Question 3: Do you think governments or local communities should take the lead in rural development?</strong></p>
<p>Band 7 Answer:</p>
<p>Both should work together. Governments can give funding and support, but local people know their land and what works. For example, in one case, local farmers suggested starting bee colonies, which wasn’t in the original plan, but it worked well. So, community ideas should be listened to.</p>
<p>I believe both have important roles to play. Governments can provide funding, training, and help with the design and long-term planning of development programmes. But local communities know their environment best and often come up with creative, practical solutions that outsiders might overlook. For example, in one case, farmers suggested starting bee colonies, which weren’t part of the original plan, but ended up becoming a valuable source of income. So collaboration between both sides is key.</p>

<section id="finding-collocations" class="level1" data-number="1">
<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Finding collocations</h1>
<p>There are two main ways in which we can find collocations</p>
<ul>
<li>We can train ourselves to notice them whenever we read or listen to anything in English.</li>
</ul>
<p>Look at the collocations that are worth learning from this short text in English.</p>
<p><em>After <strong>giving</strong> Mark a <strong>lift</strong> to the airport, Julie <strong>made her way</strong> home. What an exciting <strong>life</strong> he <strong>led</strong>! At times Julie felt <strong>desperately jealous</strong> of him. She <strong>spent her time</strong> doing little more than <strong>taking care of</strong> him and the children. Now her sister was <strong>getting divorced</strong> and would doubtless be making demands on her too. Julie had promised to <strong>give</strong> her sister <strong>a call</strong> as soon as she got home but she decided to <strong>run</strong> herself a <strong>bath</strong> first. She had a <strong>sharp pain</strong> in her side and hoped that a hot bath might <strong>ease the pain</strong>.</em></p>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Get into the habit of making a note of any good collocations you come across in any English text you read.</p>
</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li>We can find them in any good learner’s dictionary. For example, if we look up the word <em>sharp</em> we will find some of these collocations</li>
</ul>
<p>a sharp pain</p>
<p>a sharp bend/turn</p>
<p>a sharp contrast/difference/distinction</p>
<p>a sharp rise/increase/drop</p>

</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>When you look up a new word, make a point of noting it down in several different collocations.</p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<section id="recording-collocations" class="level1" data-number="2">
<h1 data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Recording collocations</h1>
<p>The best way to record a collocation is in a phrase or a sentence showing how it is used. Highlight the collocation by underlining it or by using a highlight pen.</p>
<p>For example: I don’t <u>have access to</u> that kind of secret information.</p>
<p>Or: Jim gave me a very useful <span style="background:#fff88f">piece of advice</span>.</p>
</section>
<section id="learning-collocations" class="level1" data-number="3">
<h1 data-number="3"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Learning collocations</h1>
<p>Learning collocations is not so different from learning any vocabulary item. The key things are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>regularly revise what we want to learn</li>
<li>practice using what we want to learn in contexts that are meaningful for us personality</li>
<li>learn collocations in groups to help us fix them in our memory. We might group together collocations relating to the same topic. Or we might group collocations based on the same word, for example:</li>
</ul>
<p>I must <strong>find a way</strong> to help him.</p>
<p>Can you <strong>find your way</strong> back to my house?</p>
<p>I <strong>learnt the hard way</strong> that Jack can’t be trusted.</p>
<p>Please tell me if I’m <strong>getting in your way</strong>.</p>
<p>You must <strong>give way to</strong> traffic from the left.</p>
<p>I’ve <strong>tried every possible way</strong> to get him to change his mind.</p>

<p>In the morning I made some work in the garden, then I spent a rest for about an hour before going out to have some shopping in town. It was my sister’s birthday and I wanted to do a special effort to cook a nice meal for her. I gave a look at a new Thai cookery book in the bookshop and decided to buy it. It has some totally easy recipes and I managed to do a good impression with my very first Thai meal. I think my sister utterly enjoyed her birthday.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: I wouldn’t worry. They’ll probably start you as a receptionist, or something like that. So what’s important for that kind of job isn’t so much having business skills or knowing lots of different computer systems – it’s communication (Q3) that really matters – so you’d be fine there.</p>
<p>💡 Why?</p>
<p>William contrasts what is not important with what is important. Let’s break it down:</p>
<p>He says “it isn’t so much having business skills or knowing lots of different computer systems.”</p>
<p>Then he clearly emphasizes: “it’s communication that really matters.”</p>
<p>So, he’s saying communication is the most important skill for these roles — not business skills or technical computer knowledge.</p>
<p>This makes communication the correct word for Q3.</p>
<p>❗ Why it’s wrong:</p>
<p>You misunderstood the negative structure of the sentence:</p>
<p>“It isn’t so much business skills…” → means business skills are not the most important.</p>
<p>You heard “business skills” and assumed it was the answer because it sounded related.</p>
<p>You also mentioned you thought “skills” was plural, and “business” felt like a category.</p>
<p>This is a common mistake when learners miss negative contrast signals like “isn’t” or “not as important as…”</p>
<p>How to Avoid This Mistake in the Future</p>
<p>👂 Listening Tip:</p>
<p>Pay close attention to negatives and contrasts. Phrases like:</p>
<p>“It’s not so much…”</p>
<p>“The most important thing is…”</p>
<p>“More than… it’s…”</p>
<p>These show the speaker is making a comparison — the second part is usually the correct answer.</p>
<p>🧠 Practice Sentence Structures:</p>
<p>“It’s not so much X, but Y.” → Y is more important.</p>
<p>“What matters most is Y, not X.” → Again, Y is the answer.</p>

<p>Complete the sentence:</p>
<p>Company provides a __________ for local transport and heritage sites.</p>
<p>🔍 Transcript Focus – Q18 Section:</p>
<p>“Day four is free for you to explore, using the <strong>pass</strong> which we’ll give you. So you won’t have to pay for travel on local transport, or for entrance to the island’s heritage sites.”</p>
<p>✅ Correct Answer: pass</p>
<p>💡 Why?</p>
<p>The speaker clearly says they will give you a pass.</p>
<p>The pass allows you to:</p>
<p>Use local transport</p>
<p>Enter heritage sites for free</p>
<p>So the thing the company provides is a pass — not the entrance itself. The entrance is free, but only because of the pass.</p>
<p>❌ Your Answer: entrance</p>
<p>❗ Why It’s Incorrect:</p>
<p>You probably focused on the phrase: “entrance to the island’s heritage sites” and assumed that was the answer.</p>
<p>However, “entrance” is not what is being provided.</p>
<p>Instead, the company provides a “pass”, and that pass grants you free entrance.</p>
<p>So, this is a case of not following the logic of the sentence:</p>
<p>What is provided? → a pass</p>
<p>What does it allow? → free entrance</p>

<p>❌ Question 21:</p>
<p>What personality trait is associated with the eldest child?</p>
<p>Your answer: H – competitive</p>
<p>Correct answer: G – caring</p>
<p>🔍 Transcript says:</p>
<p>“Some studies claimed that they were thought to be good at nurturing – certainly in the past when people had large families they would have been expected to look after the younger ones.”</p>
<p>✅ Why G is correct:</p>
<p>Nurturing directly matches G: caring</p>
<p>This was a positive trait assigned to eldest children in older, larger families</p>
<p>❌ Why H (competitive) is wrong:</p>
<p>Nowhere in the transcript is competitiveness mentioned regarding eldest children.</p>
<p>❌ Question 22:</p>
<p>What personality trait is associated with a middle child?</p>
<p>Your answer: G – caring</p>
<p>Correct answer: F – co-operative</p>
<p>🔍 Transcript says:</p>
<p>“One trait that a lot of the studies mention is that they are easier to get on with… Generally eager to please and helpful.”</p>
<p>✅ Why F is correct:</p>
<p>“Easier to get on with,” “eager to please,” and “helpful” all suggest co-operative</p>
<p>❌ Why G (caring) is wrong:</p>
<p>While being “helpful” and “eager to please” might sound like “caring,” the word “co-operative” better captures the idea of getting along well with others, which is what the transcript emphasizes.</p>
<p>❌ Question 25:</p>
<p>What personality trait is associated with an only child?</p>
<p>Your answer: D – attention-seeking</p>
<p>Correct answer: B – selfish</p>
<p>🔍 Transcript says:</p>
<p>“Only children have had a really bad press – a lot of studies have branded them as loners who think the world revolves around them because they’ve never had to fight for their parents’ attention.”</p>
<p>✅ Why B is correct:</p>
<p>Thinking “the world revolves around them” matches the idea of selfishness</p>
<p>❌ Why D (attention-seeking) is wrong:</p>
<p>The phrase “never had to fight for attention” implies they don’t need to seek attention — they already have it.</p>
<p>❌ Question 30:</p>
<p>Which experience of sibling rivalry do both speakers agree was valuable?</p>
<p>Your answer: A – learning to share</p>
<p>Correct answers: B – learning to stand up for oneself, D – learning to be tolerant</p>
<p>🔍 Transcript says:</p>
<p>Ruth: “My younger brother was incredibly annoying… but I think this has made me a stronger person. I know how to defend myself.”</p>
<p>“…we had to put up with each other” → shows tolerance</p>
<p>Ed: “Yes, my situation was pretty similar.”</p>
<p>✅ Why B and D are correct:</p>
<p>B: stand up for oneself → matches “defend myself”</p>
<p>D: be tolerant → matches “put up with each other”</p>
<p>❌ Why A (learning to share) is wrong:</p>
<p>Ed specifically says:</p>
<p>“I was never prepared to let my brothers use any of my stuff.”</p>
<p>So they did NOT learn to share!</p>
<p>🎯 How to Improve:</p>
<p>✅ 1. Match Meaning, Not Just Keywords</p>
<p>Don’t just pick a word that sounds vaguely related — match the intent and meaning, especially when traits are described using different language.</p>
<p>✅ 2. Watch for Negative Statements</p>
<p>“Never had to fight for attention” ≠ “attention-seeking”</p>
<p>Pay attention to what the speaker is contrasting or rejecting</p>
<p>✅ 3. Use Process of Elimination</p>
<p>For each trait option, ask: “Was this clearly supported?” Eliminate ones with no textual evidence.</p>

<p>Mundulla Yellows – Cause: lime used for making __________ was absorbed</p>
<p>🔍 Relevant Transcript Segment:</p>
<p>“It wasn’t until 2004 that they found the cause of the problem was lime, or calcium hydroxide to give it its proper chemical name, which was being used in the construction of roads. The lime was being washed away into the ground and affecting the roots of the eucalyptus trees nearby.”</p>
<p>✅ Correct Answer: roads</p>
<p>💡 Why?</p>
<p>The lime (calcium hydroxide) was used in building roads.</p>
<p>It affected the soil and caused the eucalyptus trees to suffer because it interfered with iron absorption.</p>
<p>So the missing word is “roads”, as the construction of roads was the source of the lime contamination.</p>
<p>❌ Your Answer: “roast”</p>
<p>❗ Why It’s Incorrect:</p>
<p>Likely due to a listening error caused by fast speech or unfamiliar pronunciation.</p>
<p>The word “roads” may have sounded like “roast” because:</p>
<p>The /d/ sound in “roads” is soft and might blend with other words.</p>
<p>You may not have expected “roads” to be related to eucalyptus trees, so you misinterpreted the context.</p>
<p>“Roast” doesn’t logically fit here — it has no connection to lime or tree health.</p>
<p>🔁 IELTS Listening Strategy: How to Avoid This Mistake</p>
<p>👂 1. Use Context to Predict Answers</p>
<p>Before listening, read the sentence:</p>
<p>“Lime used for making ________ was absorbed…”</p>
<p>Lime is commonly used in construction, so possible logical answers include roads, buildings, etc.</p>
<p>“Roast” doesn’t fit this context. Always cross-check with logic.</p>
<p>✍️ 2. Note Word Relationships</p>
<p>The phrase “used for making roads” is collocated (words that commonly go together).</p>
<p>Learn common collocations like:</p>
<p>build/make roads, bridges, buildings</p>
<p>roast meat, coffee, etc.</p>
<p>🎧 3. Practice with Accents</p>
<p>Native speakers may pronounce “roads” quickly: /rəʊdz/ – especially in Australian/British accents.</p>
<p>Practice listening to Australian speakers to get used to this rhythm and pronunciation.</p>

<p>I come from a small family - it’s just me and my younger sibling. Since there are only two of us, we’ve always been quite close, although of course we had our share of sibling rivalry growing up.</p>
</section>
<section id="are-you-the-oldest-youngest-or-a-middle-child" class="level3" data-number="7.1.2">
<h3 data-number="7.1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="are-you-the-oldest-youngest-or-a-middle-child"><span class="header-section-number">7.1.2</span> Are you the oldest, youngest or a middle child ?</h3>
<p>I’m the oldest child, and that often came with extra responsibilities. For example, I was expected to set a good example and sometimes even help take care of my younger sibling. That definitely influenced how I developed certain traits like being more disciplined and organized.</p>
</section>
<section id="do-you-think-your-personality-has-been-affected-by-your-birth-order" class="level3" data-number="7.1.3">
<h3 data-number="7.1.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="do-you-think-your-personality-has-been-affected-by-your-birth-order"><span class="header-section-number">7.1.3</span> Do you think your personality has been affected by your birth order?</h3>
<p>Yes, I think so. As the eldest, I felt a certain pressure to be mature and dependable. I’ve always bene quite dominant in group settings, and I think that’s partly because I got used to being in charge at home. At the same time, I believe it made me more protective and nurturing as an older brother,.</p>
<p>Part 2: Cue Card Sample Answer (Oldest Child, One Sibling)</p>
<p>Describe how your position in the family may have influenced your personality.</p>
<p>You should say:</p>
<p>What your position in the family is</p>
<p>What traits are associated with this position</p>
<p>Whether you agree with them</p>
<p>And explain how this may have affected your relationships</p>
<p>Sample Answer:</p>
<p>I’m the oldest of two children — I have a younger sibling. In many families, the eldest child is expected to be responsible, organised, and a bit more mature than the others. I’d say those traits do describe me fairly well. From an early age, I felt a sense of responsibility, especially when it came to setting an example or helping out around the house.</p>
<p>One stereotype about eldest children is that they tend to be dominant or even bossy. While I try not to be overbearing, I do like being in control of situations, especially in group work or decision-making. So in that sense, I guess the stereotype fits a little.</p>
<p>Being the older sibling has definitely influenced my relationships, both within and outside the family. With my sibling, I’ve often taken on a protective role — sometimes maybe too much. In friendships, I tend to be quite dependable and often take initiative, perhaps because I’m used to leading.</p>
<p>Overall, I believe that being the oldest has shaped my confidence and helped me develop strong interpersonal skills. It has its challenges, but it’s also given me a sense of purpose and direction.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Do you think birth order really influences a person’s personality?</li>
</ol>
<p>Sample Answer:</p>
<p>To some extent, yes. There’s empirical evidence suggesting that the eldest child tends to be more dominant and responsible, while the youngest might be more attention-seeking. However, I think environment and parenting styles are also major factors, so it’s not entirely about birth order.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Why do some people reject these birth order theories?</li>
</ol>
<p>Sample Answer:</p>
<p>Some argue that these theories are based on stereotypes rather than consistent data. In fact, people often don’t fit neatly into these categories. For instance, an only child might be seen as self-centred, but that doesn’t apply to everyone. Personality is shaped by many variables, not just the order in which someone is born.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>How can sibling rivalry impact a child’s development?</li>
</ol>
<p>Sample Answer:</p>
<p>Sibling rivalry can have both negative and positive effects. On the downside, it may lead to long-term resentment if not managed properly. But on the upside, it can help children learn to stand up for themselves, negotiate, and even verbalise their feelings more effectively.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Are families today different in how they affect personality compared to the past?</li>
</ol>
<p>Sample Answer:</p>
<p>Definitely. Modern families tend to be smaller, and parenting is more focused on emotional well-being. In the past, eldest children often had to take on more responsibility, especially in large families. Now, the distribution of roles is more balanced, which may lead to less rigid personality traits based on birth order.</p>

  <title>A One-sentence Argument</title>

<section id="one-conclusion-or-many-conclusions" class="level1" data-number="1">
<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> One conclusion or many conclusions?</h1>
<p>A typical IELTS essay consists of an <strong>introduction</strong>, <strong>several body paragraphs</strong>, and a <strong>conclusion</strong>. The final conclusion at the end of the essay summarises your <strong>overall argument</strong> and <strong>final position</strong>, thus completing the essay.</p>
<p>However, the <strong>body paragraphs</strong> of your essay also include a different kind of <strong>conclusion</strong>.</p>
<section id="understanding-the-word-argument" class="level2" data-number="1.1">
<h2 data-number="1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="understanding-the-word-argument"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Understanding the Word “Argument”</h2>
<p>An <strong>argument</strong> is defined as a <strong>reason (or set of reasons)</strong> given in support of an idea or position. This definition helps clarify a key concept in IELTS writing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your essay should present <strong>one overall argument</strong></li>
<li>This overall argument is made up of <strong>several shorter arguments</strong> (also known as <strong>main ideas</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these shorter arguments should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clearly explained</li>
<li>Well-organised</li>
<li>Logically linked to the rest of the essay</li>
</ul>
<p>Together, these create <strong>unity and coherence</strong>.</p>
<p>If any of your main ideas are unclear or weak, it affects:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>progression</strong> of your essay</li>
<li>The <strong>clarity</strong> of your position</li>
<li>Your score in <strong>Coherence and Cohesion</strong> and <strong>Task Response</strong></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="main-ideas-as-arguments-and-conclusions" class="level2" data-number="1.2">
<h2 data-number="1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="main-ideas-as-arguments-and-conclusions"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Main Ideas as Arguments and Conclusions</h2>
<p>Each <strong>main idea</strong> in your body paragraphs should be structured as an <strong>argument</strong>. This means it should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Present a <strong>conclusion</strong> (what you believe)</li>
<li>Provide a <strong>reason</strong> (why you believe it)</li>
</ul>
<p>This structure is often seen in the <strong>first and last sentences</strong> of a paragraph, but it can appear in other forms as well. Whenever you state your opinion or present a point, you are effectively <strong>making an argument</strong> and offering a <strong>conclusion</strong>.</p>
<p>This is directly connected to the <strong>Task Response</strong> criterion in the IELTS Band Descriptors. For example:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Band 6: “The conclusions may become unclear.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This happens when the points in your body paragraphs are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not well supported</li>
<li>Poorly explained</li>
<li>Disconnected from the overall argument</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="key-idea" class="level2" data-number="1.3">
<h2 data-number="1.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-idea"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Key Idea</h2>
<p>An <strong>argument</strong> is a <strong>statement provided as evidence</strong> to show that another statement — the <strong>conclusion</strong> — is true. The <strong>main ideas</strong> or <strong>points</strong> in your body paragraphs should always be structured this way to form a strong, logical essay.</p>
<p>In later lessons, these paragraph-level arguments will be referred to as <strong>points</strong> or <strong>main ideas</strong>, but it’s important to understand that each one must function as an argument: a reasoned statement that leads to a clear conclusion.</p>

<section id="a-one-sentence-argument" class="level2" data-number="1.4">
<h2 data-number="1.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-one-sentence-argument"><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> A one-sentence argument</h2>
<p>Although our main ideas will generally be explained over several sentences within a paragraph, we’ll begin by looking at a simple one-sentence argument:</p>
<p><em>Fruit contains vitamin C, which helps keep us healthy, so the government should encourage everyone to eat more fruit.</em></p>
<p>To demonstrate that this is an argument, we can seperate it into a conclusion and the reasons given for believing it.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Conclusion: The government should encourage everyone to eat more fruit.</p>
<p>Reason 1) fruit contains vitamin C</p>
<p>Reason 2) vitamin C helps to keep us healthy</p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<section id="point-to-notice" class="level2" data-number="1.5">
<h2 data-number="1.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="point-to-notice"><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> Point to notice:</h2>
<p>1 The conclusion does not always come after the reasons. This means that we can also write:</p>
<p><em>The government should encourage everyone to eat more fruit because it contains vitamin C, which is good for health.</em></p>
<p>Even though the order has changed, the conclusion remains the same: the government should encourage everyone to eat more fruit.</p>
<p>2 Each reason in this argument is called a ‘<strong>premise</strong>’, which means a claim being made by the writer. The writer is asking the reader to accept these claims (that fruit contains vitamin C, and vitamin C helps keep us healthy) are true, and that they are good enough reasons to conclude that the government should encourage everyone to eat more fruit. When we are writing, we need to make sure that our claims are true (or at least believable), and that they know the reader that our conclusions are reasonable.</p>
<p>3 We are giving our position every time we make an argument like this one. This mean that we do not need to write <em>I believe; I think; In my view</em> to make our position clear; whether our position remains clear or not will depend on the language we use, and the reasons we provide to support it. Even more importantly, simply writing <em>In my view</em> at the beginning and end of our essay, and within our body paragraphs, is not enough to make our position clear throughout. Only the language and reasoning in our argument can do that.</p>
<div class="callout callout-style-default callout-tip callout-titled">
<div class="callout-header d-flex align-content-center">
<div class="callout-icon-container">

</div>
<div class="callout-title-container flex-fill">
Tip
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>You are giving your position every time you make an argument or claim. Whether your position remains clear or not will depend on the language you use and the reasons you provide to support it. Writing ‘In my view’ (etc.) at the beginning and end of your essay and within your body paragraphs is not enough to make your position clear throughout - only the language and reasoning in your argument can do that.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Every task 2 question presents an argument or a claim that we need to respond to with our own argument.</p>

<h1 data-number="3"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> IELTS Writing: Reasoning Problems in Argument Structure</h1>
<p>In IELTS essays, an argument or idea can remain <strong>unclear</strong> even if the <strong>language used is accurate</strong>. This happens when the <strong>reasoning</strong> behind the idea is weak or confusing.</p>
<p>In fact, a large portion of <strong>band 6 writing</strong> contains <strong>unclear or invalid arguments</strong>, rather than language errors. Understanding how to structure logical and persuasive reasoning is essential for higher scores.</p>

<h3 data-number="3.1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="making-a-point-without-a-reason"><span class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> 1. Making a Point Without a Reason</h3>
<p>Stating a conclusion without explaining why you believe it leads to weak writing.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> &gt; The government should encourage everyone to eat more fruit.</p>
<p>This is a conclusion, but it lacks a reason. The reader is left wondering: - Why should the government do this? - What benefit does this have?</p>
</section>

<h3 data-number="3.1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="giving-a-reason-that-doesnt-support-the-conclusion"><span class="header-section-number">3.1.2</span> 2. Giving a Reason That Doesn’t Support the Conclusion</h3>
<p>Sometimes a writer includes a reason or example, but it does not <strong>logically support</strong> the conclusion.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> &gt; The government should encourage everyone to eat more fruit.<br>
&gt; For example, a BBC documentary showed that 85% of people eat fruit.</p>
<p>This fact (even if true) <strong>does not explain</strong> or <strong>support</strong> the conclusion. It fails to show <strong>why</strong> the government should promote fruit consumption. In many cases, the example is also <strong>clearly invented</strong> and adds confusion instead of clarity.</p>
<p>These types of errors are <strong>very common</strong> in student essays and are a key reason for a <strong>band 6 score in Task Response</strong>.</p>

<h2 data-number="3.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-makes-an-argument-clear-and-valid"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> What Makes an Argument Clear and Valid</h2>
<p>In a <strong>clear, valid argument</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>reason is directly related</strong> to the conclusion.</li>
<li>The <strong>example or evidence</strong> helps to explain <strong>why the conclusion is correct</strong>.</li>
<li>The reader is persuaded because the logic is sound.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Strong Example:</strong> &gt; The government should encourage everyone to eat more fruit<br>
&gt; because increased fruit consumption can reduce national healthcare costs by lowering the rates of heart disease and diabetes.</p>
<p>Here, the <strong>reason logically supports</strong> the conclusion. The reader understands <strong>why</strong> the statement is made and can follow the writer’s reasoning.</p>

<li>Clear language alone is not enough for a high band score.</li>
<li>You must also ensure that your <strong>reasoning is logical</strong> and that each <strong>point is clearly explained and supported</strong>.</li>

<section id="why-it-matters" class="level1" data-number="1">
<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Why it Matters</h1>
<p>The IELTS Listening test does not give you a second chance — you hear it once only. Effective note-taking bridges the gap between what you hear and what you need to write, especially when:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The answer is paraphrased</p></li>
<li><p>You forget a detail by the time you get to the gap</p></li>
<li><p>You need to choose from multiple options</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="full-step-by-step-method-for-real-test-use" class="level1" data-number="2">

<section id="before-recording-starts" class="level2" data-number="2.1">
<h2 data-number="2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="before-recording-starts"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Before Recording Starts</h2>
<p>Step 1: Underline Keywords</p>
<ul>
<li>Read all questions in the section (you have 30-60 seconds).</li>
<li>Underline 1 - 2 key words in each question:
<ul>
<li>Nouns, numbers, verbs</li>
<li>Signal words like “before”, “after”, “because”, “although”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>✅ Example:</p>
<p>Q11: The band has approximately ___ members.</p>
<p>→ underline: band, approximately, members</p>

<h2 data-number="2.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="while-listening"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> While Listening</h2>
<p>Step 2: Takes Notes Quickly</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Don’t write full sentences. Use:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Abbreviations: e.g.&nbsp;“gov” = government, “↓” = decrease</p></li>
<li><p>Symbols: e.g.&nbsp;→ (cause), ~ (related), ≠ (opposite)</p></li>
<li><p>Short forms: “env. prob.” = environmental problem</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>✅ Use These Formats:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mind-map style: great for summaries or processes</p></li>
<li><p>Columns: ideal for conversations (e.g.&nbsp;Speaker A | Speaker B)</p></li>
<li><p>Numbered list: good for lectures or instructions</p></li>
</ul>
<p>✅ Key Focus:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Listen for paraphrasing (not exact match)</p></li>
<li><p>Pay attention to signpost words:</p></li>
<li><p>“Next,” “Then,” “However,” “In contrast,” “Finally”</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Step 3: Transfer Notes to Answers</p>
<p>Use the 30 seconds after each part to:</p>
<p>Read back your notes</p>
<p>Match meaning, not just words</p>
<p>Confirm singular/plural, spelling, grammar</p>
<p>Eliminate distractors if it’s multiple choice</p>

<p>You got A (decorating) correct – mentioned as: “do some painting or wallpapering.”</p>
<p>You chose D (shopping) — not quite correct. Shopping is suggested in the line:</p>
<p>“…recommend how to plan their budget or how to shop sensibly…”</p>
<p>But that’s only giving advice, not actually shopping.</p>
<p>You missed E (childcare) — mentioned as:</p>
<p>“…do some babysitting so that parents can go out…”</p>
<p>This is direct childcare.</p>
<p>🟨 Common trap: Hearing a keyword (like “shop”) without checking if it’s the actual activity done by the volunteer.</p>

<p>🔹 Q15: Habib → F (Remember past times)</p>
<p>You chose A: Overcome physical difficulties — which is not the case. It was about music triggering memories, not about any physical help.</p>
<p>✅ What to listen for:</p>
<p>“Songs take them back to their youth” → keyword: “remember”, not “recover physically”</p>
<p>🔹 Q16: Consuela → A (Overcome physical difficulties)</p>
<p>You chose B: Rediscover skills not used — but she wasn’t helping them recover a skill like cooking or crafting.</p>
<p>Instead, it was walking — she inspires mobility by example.</p>
<p>✅ Tip: Listen for physical movement = “overcome physical difficulties”</p>

<p>Tips to Fix These Mistakes</p>
<p>🔹 Q21 – Mishearing Numbers</p>
<p>Practice listening to quantities with context, especially when they contrast past and present:</p>
<p>“I used to teach bands of 20, this one has about 50.”</p>
<p>✅ Fix: Pause &amp; mentally label the number with “current size”.</p>
<p>🔹 Q22 – Trap Words</p>
<p>This is a classic IELTS trick: mention a wrong option first (national), then correct it (regional).</p>
<p>“Not national… but regional.”</p>
<p>✅ Fix: Focus on what they finally decide, not the first idea.</p>
<p>🔹 Q24 – Drummer vs Drama</p>
<p>“Drummer” and “Drama” are close in sound, but context helps:</p>
<p>“…playing in a band changed his life” → clearly a musician, not an actor.</p>
<p>✅ Fix: Listen for context clues. Ask: who is talking, what’s the story about?</p>

<p>Question 32</p>
<p>You wrote: VIBRANT</p>
<p>Correct answer: ENERGY</p>
<p>Transcript:</p>
<p>“Liza Lim’s compositions are vibrant and full of energy…”</p>
<p>Why this is wrong:</p>
<p>The question says:</p>
<p>“compositions show a great deal of _____”</p>
<p>→ So you need a noun that matches “a great deal of”.</p>
<p>“A great deal of” cannot be followed by adjectives like “vibrant”.</p>
<p>“Vibrant” describes the style, but the answer must be a specific noun, and that noun is “energy”.</p>

</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<ul>
<li><p>Pay close attention to grammatical structures in the question.</p></li>
<li><p>Look for exact matches between the question’s collocations (like “a great deal of”) and the noun in the audio.</p></li>
<li><p>Words near the answer (like “vibrant”) can mislead you — IELTS often puts distractors nearby to test your focus on function, not just vocabulary.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>Question 40</p>
<p>You wrote: OLYMPIC</p>
<p>Correct answer: OLYMPICS</p>
<p>Transcript:</p>
<p>“…his music for the flag hand-over ceremony of the Olympics held in 1996.”</p>
<p>Why this is wrong:</p>
<p>The word “Olympic” is an adjective (e.g.&nbsp;Olympic Games, Olympic athlete).</p>
<p>The blank in the sentence requires a noun to complete the phrase:</p>
<p>“festival will include his music for the 1996 ________”</p>
<p>So the correct noun is Olympics, referring to the global sports event.</p>
<p>Tip:</p>
<p>Always match the word form (noun/verb/adjective) to the grammar of the sentence.</p>
<p>Listen for plural endings — “Olympics” is clearly plural in pronunciation.</p>
<p>Review common proper nouns and event names like “the Olympics”, “the World Cup”, etc.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li><p>Check the grammar of the sentence before choosing your answer — think: Does this need a noun? An adjective? A plural?</p></li>
<li><p>Underline key phrases in the question, such as “a great deal of,” “consists of,” “includes,” etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Practice identifying distractors — words that appear in the audio but are not correct answers.</p></li>
<li><p>Improve your listening for plurals and noun forms, especially for names of events or measurements.</p></li>

<li>a There are several problem with this idea. b There are several problems with this idea. -&gt; b</li>
<li>a Many charity organizations provide a great deal of help b Many charity organization provides a great deal of help -&gt;a</li>
</ol>
<p>If we use a plural noun, we must use a plural verb. The verb must ‘agree’ with the noun:</p>
<p><em>In my country, <strong>there are</strong> very few <strong>cars</strong> that use leaded petrol.</em> (plural verb + plural noun)</p>
<p><em>I like studying during the day but <strong>my friend prefers</strong> studying at night.</em> (singular noun + singular verb)</p>
<p>We use a plural noun with: - plural verbs: <em>are, were, have, do, play, etc.</em>: There are a lot of books on the table. - numbers greater than one: 30 cars, 100 students - <em>many</em>: It is annoying that so <strong>many buses drive</strong> fast because they <strong>are</strong> full. - <em>the number of</em>: <strong>The number of buses</strong> on our roads <strong>has</strong> increased each year.</p>
<p>Note that we use a plural noun but a singular verb after <em>the number of</em></p>
<p>We use a singular noun with: - singular verbs: <em>is, was, has, does, plays, etc.</em>: There is only one bedroom in the flat. - <em>a/an</em> or <em>one</em>: a car, one student</p>
<p>Note that some nouns can look plural but are singular (<em>news, mathematics</em>) and some nouns have a different form in the plural (<em>children, men, women, people</em>)</p>

<p>Some nouns in English are ‘uncountable’. This means they do not have a plural form. Some common uncountable nouns are: <em>advice, advertising, food, furniture, garbage, information, knowledge, money, shopping, time, traffic, travel</em></p>
<p>With uncountable nouns, you must see:</p>
<ul>
<li>the singular form: <em>food, information, money</em></li>
<li><em>a little / amount of / much / some</em>: How <font color="#00b050">much money</font> do you have? The <font color="#00b050">amount of traffic</font> on the roads is increasing each year.</li>
<li>a singular verb: There <font color="#00b050">was</font> already a little <font color="#00b050">furniture</font> in the flat.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a noun is uncountable, you cannot use:</p>
<ul>
<li>a plural form: ~~advices, furnitures, garbages, informations, knowledges ~~</li>
<li>a/an: <del>an advice, a garbage, a knowledge</del></li>
<li>a few / many / number of: <del>a few shopping, many traffie, the number of knowledge</del></li>
<li>a number: <del>three travels, four furniture</del></li>
<li>a plural verb: <del>There were a little furniture in the flat.</del></li>
</ul>
<p>If we want to add a number to an uncountable noun, we can use <em>a piece of / some / a few pieces of</em>: <font color="#00b050">a piece of advice, three pieces of furniture, a few pieces of garbage</font></p>

<p>When I left university I <strong>made a decision</strong> to take up a profession in which I could be creative. I could play the guitar, but I’d never written any songs. Nonetheless, I decided to become a singer-songwriter. I made some recordings but I had a <strong>rather heavy cold</strong>, so they didn’t <strong>sound good</strong>. I made some more, and sent them to a <strong>record company</strong> and waited for them to reply. So, while I was waiting to become famous, I got a job in a <strong>fastfood</strong> restaurant. That was five years ago. I’m still doing the same job.</p>

<li>a Many charity organizations provide a great deal of help b Many charity organization provides a great deal of help -&gt;a</li>
</ol>
<p>If we use a plural noun, we must use a plural verb. The verb must ‘agree’ with the noun:</p>
<p><em>In my country, <strong>there are</strong> very few <strong>cars</strong> that use leaded petrol.</em> (plural verb + plural noun)</p>
<p><em>I like studying during the day but <strong>my friend prefers</strong> studying at night.</em> (singular noun + singular verb)</p>
<p>We use a plural noun with: - plural verbs: <em>are, were, have, do, play, etc.</em>: There are a lot of books on the table. - numbers greater than one: 30 cars, 100 students - <em>many</em>: It is annoying that so <strong>many buses drive</strong> fast because they <strong>are</strong> full. - <em>the number of</em>: <strong>The number of buses</strong> on our roads <strong>has</strong> increased each year.</p>
<p>Note that we use a plural noun but a singular verb after <em>the number of</em></p>
<p>We use a singular noun with: - singular verbs: <em>is, was, has, does, plays, etc.</em>: There is only one bedroom in the flat. - <em>a/an</em> or <em>one</em>: a car, one student</p>
<p>Note that some nouns can look plural but are singular (<em>news, mathematics</em>) and some nouns have a different form in the plural (<em>children, men, women, people</em>)</p>

  <title>Linking ideas in academic writing and speech</title>
  <dc:creator>Hung </dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<section id="a" class="level1" data-number="1">
<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> A</h1>
<p><em>Sentence connectors, conjunctions</em> and <em>pro-forms</em> are used to link ideas in academic writing and speaking in a number of ways.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Sentence connectors</em> link sentences. There is usually a full stop at the end of the first sentence, and the sentence connector often comes at the start of the next.</li>
<li><em>Conjunctions</em> link clauses within sentences. A comma often separates the clauses. Most conjunctions come at the start of their clause.</li>
<li><em>Pro-forms</em> are general words or phrases that refer back to more specific words or phrases, avoiding repetition.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<p><strong>In sum</strong><sup>1</sup>, temperature is an important factor determining the shelf life of a food product <strong>in that</strong><sup>2</sup> variations in temperature can result in the growth of microorganisms which can cause the product the spoil. <strong>Furthermore</strong><sup>3</sup>, incorrect freezing can damage the proteins of meat or other products. <strong>Given that</strong><sup>4</sup> the maintenance of the correct temperature over a long period is essential, it is necessary to use time temperature indicators. Studies have shown that these indicators reduce food waste considerably. <strong>As well</strong><sup>5</sup>, they reduce the number of foodborne illnesses.</p>
<p>Sociology researchers use two types of information: primary data and secondary data. <strong>The former</strong><sup>6</sup> is collected by the researcher themselves, <strong>whereas</strong><sup>7</sup> secondary data already exists in some form, such as documents or previous research. Collecting primary data can be time-consuming and expensive, and <strong>as such</strong><sup>8</sup>, undergraduate researchers often prefer to use secondary data.</p>
</section>
<section id="b---in-speaking" class="level1" data-number="2">
<h1 data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> B - In Speaking</h1>
<p>Some sentence connectors, conjunctions and pro-forms used in writing have equivalent words or phrases which are more common in speaking. Compare these extracts from a spoken presentation with the text in A:</p>
<p><strong>To put it briefly</strong>, temperature is an important factor …</p>
<p><strong>The reason for this is that</strong> variations in temperature can result in …</p>
<p><strong>On top of that</strong>, incorrect freezing can damage …</p>
<p><strong>Taking into account that</strong> the maintenance of the correct temperature …</p>
<p><strong>Also</strong>, they reduce the number …</p>
<p>Here are more examples of formal linking words and phrases. Possible informal alternatives are given in brackets, although these will not substitute for the more formal linking word or phrase in every context.</p>

<p>‘Biodiversity’ is the abbreviated word for ‘biological diversity’. <strong>The latter</strong> -&gt; <font color="#00b050">The last / the second</font> term appears to have come into use in the early 1980s, when Bruce Wilcox defined it <strong>as follows</strong>-&gt; <font color="#00b050">in this way/ like this</font>: “the variety of life forms … at all levels of biological systems - molecular, organismic, population species and ecosystem”. <strong>Hitherto</strong> -&gt; <font color="#00b050">Before this/ that</font>, the terms ‘species diversity’ or ‘species richness’ were used. So the term ‘biological diversity’ - <strong>subsequently</strong>-&gt; <font color="#00b050">after that</font> ‘biodiversity’ is relatively new. <strong>That said</strong> -&gt; Having said that, philosophers and scientists have studied many aspects of biodiversity over hundreds of years. Even Aristotle, working nearly two and a half thousand years ago, studied biodiversity <strong>in that</strong>-&gt; <font color="#00b050">because</font> he looked for similar patterns in organisms so that he could group them together.</p>
<p><strong>Also and Further</strong>:</p>
<p>“Also” = addition of a related fact or statistic</p>
<p>It’s used here to add another data point about the same group (those who skipped breakfast).</p>
<p>It shows that skipping lunch is an additional behaviour from the same participants.</p>
<p>“Also, 15% of these…” = In addition to skipping breakfast, they also skipped lunch.</p>
<p>❌ Why not “further”?</p>
<p>“Further” is more formal and usually used to:</p>
<p>Introduce an additional argument or point in a discussion, not another data point.</p>
<p>Often appears in Task 2 essays (not typically Task 1).</p>
<p>✅ Example of correct use of “further”:</p>
<p>Further research is needed to understand the long-term effects of this trend.</p>
<p>So in IELTS Writing Task 1, where you’re presenting facts and data, “also” is usually more appropriate for connecting related statistics.</p>

<p>‘Considering’ and ‘Bearing in mind’</p>
<p>The photographs were in superb condition, ___ they were taken over a century ago.</p>
<p>✅ Correct answer (from the book): considering</p>
<p>✅ Why “considering” is the better answer here:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Grammatical Structure – Short, Integrated Clause</li>
</ol>
<p>“Considering” can be used without “that” and still form a natural, concise clause:</p>
<p>…considering they were taken over a century ago. ✅</p>
<p>✅ This flows smoothly within the sentence.</p>
<p>“Bearing in mind” often sounds heavier, and more natural when followed by “that” or used in separate clauses:</p>
<p>…bearing in mind that they were taken…</p>
<p>✅ Correct, but wordier and less idiomatic in this kind of sentence.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Tone and Register – Concise Descriptive Language</li>
</ol>
<p>In this context, you’re describing a surprising or notable fact, and “considering” is the most natural and idiomatic choice.</p>
<p>“Bearing in mind” feels more reflective or argumentative, and is better suited for conclusions or commentary, such as:</p>
<p>Bearing in mind the results, we can conclude that…</p>
<p>✅ Used more in academic or spoken reasoning, not as clean in description.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Common Usage in Writing</li>
</ol>
<p>Native speakers and academic writers frequently use “considering” in descriptive clauses:</p>
<p>It’s surprisingly warm, considering it’s still February.</p>
<p>She did well, considering how little time she had.</p>
<p>✅ This structure is frequent and natural in written English.</p>

<p>Example in Spoken IELTS:</p>
<p>The star Betelgeuse is cooler than the Sun — around 3,500 Kelvin. To put it another way, it’s only about half as hot as our Sun.</p>
<p>❌ Less Natural for Speaking:</p>
<p>That is to say, it is about half the temperature of the Sun.</p>
<p>→ Feels too formal or mechanical in a spoken explanation.</p>
<p>🧠 Tip for IELTS Speaking:</p>
<p>Use “to put it another way” when:</p>
<p>You want to simplify a fact</p>
<p>Make a comparison more relatable</p>
<p>Show communicative fluency and coherence</p>
<p>Firstly and First of all</p>

<p>Example in Academic Context (IELTS Writing Task 2):</p>
<p>There are several problems with this policy. Firstly, it may discourage innovation. Secondly, it lacks transparency.</p>
<p>❌ Less Appropriate:</p>
<p>The study has several limitations. First of all, the sample size was small.</p>
<p>→ Sounds slightly too informal for IELTS academic writing.</p>
<p>🧠 Band 8+ Writing Tip:</p>
<p>When organizing ideas in IELTS Writing Task 2 (or Task 1 GT letters), prefer:</p>
<p>Firstly, Secondly, Finally</p>
<p>In addition, Moreover, Furthermore</p>
<p>On the one hand, On the other hand</p>

    "text": "You should spend about 40 minutes on this task.\nWrite about the following topic:\nMany people in poor countries die from diseases that are curable because they cannot afford the medication required.\nDo you believe that drug companies should make their products available at reduced prices in these countries?\nGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge and experience.\nWrite at least 250 words.\n\ncurable can be made healthy again\nethical connected to beliefs about what is right or wrong\ninequality unfair differences in society\nimmunize to protect a person from a disease by giving them a vaccine\npharmaceutical medicine\nprofit to make money\nresponsible having the duty of taking care of someone or something\nresponsibility the duty of taking care of someone or something\nsubsidize to give money to somebody to help them pay for something\ntreat to give medical care to someone\ntreatment medical care given to someone\nvaccine a substance you put in your blood to protect the body from disease\nIntro paraphrase the question:\nMany people in developing nations die from diseases that could be cured, mainly because medicines are too expensive.\nthesis:\nWhile pharmaceutical companies need profit to fund research and development, I believe they should sell their products at reduced prices in poorer countries to reduce inequality and save lives.\nBody 1 - drug companies’ side\nHow do drug companies make money? -&gt; by selling medicines at high prices.\nWhy are medicines expensive? -&gt; cost of research, clinical trials, and production.\nIs this good? Yes, because without profit, they cannot innovate or create new treatments/vaccines.\nExample: Development of vaccines (like for COVID-19) required huge investment and profit incentives.\nBody 2 - Poor countries’ situation\nCan everyone in poor countries afford medicine? No, many live below poverty line.\nWhy unfair? -&gt; creates inequality; curable disease continue to kill people\nWho else can help? Governments, NGOs, international organizations (e.g. WHO) can subsidize or negotiate reduced prices.\nExample: Some vaccine programs (e.g. polio immunization) were subsidized globally, saving millions of lives.\nConclusion Summarize: Drug companies must balance profit with responsibility.\nOpinion: They should make medicines affordable in poor countries, possibly through reduced prices or subsidies, because human life is more valuable than profit.\nMany people in developing nations die from diseases that could be cured, mainly because medicines are too expensive. While pharmaceutical companies need profit to fund research and development, I believe they should sell their products at reduced prices in poorer countries to reduce inequality and save lives.\nOn the one hand, drug companies argue that their products are expensive because it need enormous resources to make. They must invest large amount of money on development process, such as research, clinical trials, vaccines, which can need several millions dollar and decades to success. Without profit, they would not be able to innovate or develop new treatments, enhance drugs. For example, the development of vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic cost billions of dollars, and only strong profits made this possible. Therefore, it is understandable that pharmaceutical companies charge high prices in order to recover their investment and continue developing new treatments.\nOn the other hand, people in poor countries often live below the poverty line, so some drugs have normal price in developed countries but cost a fortune of people in developing countries. This situation creates inequality because curable disease still kill people or destroy their family financial, making their future more hardly. In my opinion, drug companies can should reduce prices or allow governments and charities to subsidize treatments. A good example is the global campaign to immunize children against polio, where vaccines were provided a little or no cost, saving millions of lives. This shows that cooperation and reduced pricing can treat diseases effectively in poorer regions.\nIn conclusion, although drug companies must make a profit in order to fund research and the development of new medicines, I believe they also have an ethical duty to make essential treatments affordable in poorer countries. By reducing prices or cooperating with international organisations, they can continue to benefit financially while helping to reduce global inequality and save lives.\n\nMany individuals in developing countries suffer from preventable diseases due to the prohibitive cost of medication. I strongly believe that pharmaceutical companies should offer their products at reduced prices in these regions, as this approach promotes social equity, public health, and long-term business sustainability.\nLowering drug prices in low-income countries would have a profound impact on public health by making essential medicines more accessible. For instance, affordable malaria treatment could drastically reduce mortality rates in sub-Saharan Africa, where the disease is widespread. Additionally, improved health outcomes contribute to economic growth, as a healthier workforce enhances productivity and reduces the financial burden on national healthcare systems.\nCritics argue that lowering drug prices may undermine pharmaceutical companies’ ability to fund research and innovation. However, this concern can be addressed through tiered pricing models, where wealthier nations pay higher prices to compensate for lower costs in poorer regions. Moreover, international organizations and governments can provide subsidies or tax incentives to pharmaceutical firms, ensuring profitability without compromising humanitarian efforts.\nBeyond the ethical considerations already discussed, affordable medication fosters goodwill and enhances corporate reputation. Companies that engage in socially responsible pricing are likely to gain consumer trust and brand loyalty, which may lead to greater long-term profitability. Furthermore, preventing disease outbreaks in developing nations reduces the risk of global health crises, benefiting the entire world.\nIn conclusion, making essential medicines more affordable in developing countries is both a moral obligation and a strategic decision that benefits public health, economic stability, and the pharmaceutical industry itself."

IELTS often lists several possibilities, but only one is about the correct time frame.\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Q12 — \n\n\n3.1.4 The university uses part of the building as…\n\nTranscript: “…apart from two rooms that are our offices, the university uses the main part of the building. You may see students going into the building for lessons…”\nTrap: The speaker first says “offices,” but those belong to the museum staff. Then comes the real answer: teaching rooms.\nCorrect: A (teaching rooms).\n\n👉 Trap technique: Pay attention when a speaker corrects or shifts focus after an initial detail.\n\n\n\n3.1.5 Q13 — \n\n\n3.1.6 Entrance fee\n\nTranscript: “…we’ve managed to keep entry to the museum free.

Unlike other museums, photography is allowed here, so you might like to keep your cameras with you. You might be more comfortable not carrying around heavy rucksacks, though keep your coats and jackets on as it’s quite cold in the garden.”\nTrap:\n\nBags and coats are mentioned, but final advice = leave bags.\nCoats: don’t leave them (because garden is cold).\nCameras: don’t leave them (photography allowed).\n\nCorrect: C (bags).\n\n👉 Trap technique: Always notice exceptions (“unlike other museums…”, “although…”, “but…”). The examiners love switching the answer at the last second."

    "text": "Cambridge IELTS 12, page 27\n\nmale and female are adjectives (male students, female students, etc) but the same words are also nouns:\nThe number of females increased while the number of males decreased.\nWe might need to talk about ‘the female’ and ‘the male’ if we are given a life cycle of an animal, with charts and data, we are always writing about more than one, so we should not be using the singular form unless when we use it as a adjective.\nIn introduction and overview, we can make a general statement about males and females, or men and women. We can also add the nationality, to describe the main trends in the behavior of Australian men and Australian women in 2010. However, in our body paragraphs, we will mainly refer to the specific age groups.\nWe only use ‘stage’ or ‘period’ to talk about a stage or period in life. For example, ‘childhood, the teenager years’ and ‘adulthood’ are all examples of stages or periods in life. However, these terms are not appropriate for our data, which is divided into specific age group or age ranges.\n\n\nLook at the following examples then the rules below:\n\nWomen aged 25 to 34 …\nMen aged between 35 and 44 …\nWomen who were 25 to 34 years old …\nMen in the 25- to 35-year-old age group…\nThis fell from 24 years\n\nWe use ‘at’ with ‘the age of’ and ‘in’ with an age group or range. When it comes to specific ages, we can used aged, years old or year-old. When giving data like this, we can also just write the ‘number + years’\n\n\n\nWe use hyphens when the number combines with ‘year-old’ to form a compound adjective or a compound noun. So, we can write the following:\n\nI taught a class of ten-year-olds. (compound noun - plural)\nI taught a class of ten-year-old children. (compound adjective)\n\nIf we are using a range of ages, we use a hyphen with both numbers in the range:\n\nI taught a class of 20- to 25-year-olds. (compound noun in a range)\n\nThe final age group is often presented like this: 60+, 65+ etc. We can express this in two ways:\n\nMen aged 60 and over …\nWomen aged 65 and above…\n\n\n\n\nA generation is generally seen as 25 years, so the groups in our data do not represent different generations. Teenagers are people aged thirteen to nineteen, so we cannot use this tern for the youngest age group, which goes up to 24. Be careful with ‘middle’ as it has a specific meaning when combine with ‘age’. Middle-aged refers to people aged between approximately 40 and 60. You can refer to the ‘middle age groups’ (meaning the groups in the middle), but you need to be careful in using this."

Listen for the final /z/ sound.\n\nQ40 — atlas (you wrote “atlat”)\n\nWhy: Simple letter transposition under time pressure. The line was “In 1931, an atlas was published…”.\nMini rule: Use the article cue: “an atlas” → vowel sound → atlas. When you hear an article + noun, lock in the standard spelling you know."

If the text doesn’t mention it, it’s wrong — even if it sounds logical.\n\n✅ Summary of mistakes:\n\nQ15: Chose the wrong paragraph because you focused on causes of procrastination instead of the “realisation.”\nQ26: Fell into the “logical but not in the text” trap. # Part 3\n\n\n\n\n3 Mini drill\n\n3.0.1 Mini Reading Passage\nParagraph A\nMany people believe stress comes mainly from external pressure, such as work deadlines. However, recent studies show that stress often arises from how we interpret events. If two people face the same challenge, one may feel anxious, while the other feels motivated.\nParagraph B\nResearchers also discovered that people who openly share their worries with others tend to recover faster from stressful events. By realising they are not alone, they reduce feelings of isolation. This awareness has been shown to lower stress hormones.\nParagraph C\nAlthough physical exercise is usually promoted for fitness, it also reduces stress. Exercise stimulates the release of chemicals in the brain that improve mood. For this reason, many doctors recommend regular activity to patients with high stress levels.\n\n\n\n3.0.2 Questions\nQ1. Which paragraph mentions the role of personal perception in stress?\nA. Paragraph A\nB. Paragraph B\nC. Paragraph C\nQ2. Which paragraph refers to people realising that others share similar experiences?\nA. Paragraph A\nB. Paragraph B\nC. Paragraph C\nQ3. Which paragraph refers to medical recommendations about stress?\nA. Paragraph A\nB. Paragraph B\nC. Paragraph C\nQ4. Choose TWO letters, A–E. Which TWO strategies for reducing stress are mentioned in the passage?\nA. Reframing how we see challenges\nB. Avoiding all external pressure\nC. Sharing concerns with others\nD. Taking medication\nE. Exercising regularly\nQ5. Choose TWO letters, A–E. Which TWO beliefs about stress are shown to be false in the passage?\nA. Stress always comes from outside pressure\nB. Sharing problems increases stress\nC. Exercise is only good for fitness\nD. Stress affects everyone equally\nE. Doctors do not recommend exercise for stress\n1a 2b 3c\nq4 c e\nq5 c d"

    "text": "Keeping animals in captivity is cruel. There is no reason for zoos to exist in the 21st century.\nHow far do you agree or disagree with this opinion?\nAround the world, people have differing opinions about zoos. Some people believe that keeping animals in captivity is wrong, while others contend that it is necessary and that we need zoos. In this essay, I will explore both of these views, as they each have some merit, before drawing a conclusion.\nProponents of zoos tend to argue that these places are intended to educate the public about animals. They claim that people can go to zoos and become more aware of serious environmental issues, and therefore, zoos are essential in raising awareness of serious issues. For example, children can visit zoos and learn about the majestic elephant, and then adapt their behavior to become more responsible people in the future. However, this argument assumes that all zoos treat their purpose as education, when in fact many zoos are geared towards entertainment, and many people come away from a zoo visit having learned relatively little.\nOpponents of zoos claim that it is cruel to keep animals in captivity, and that therefore they belong in the wild. They point to numerous studies that show the suffering experienced by animals in even the best zoos. This is clear from evidence that many large animals require extensive space to roam that is just not available for them in their artificial enclosures, and so they suffer serious psychological and even physical damage. The fact that animals almost always live shorter lives in zoos is further proof of this fact.\nIn conclusion, although there are some good reasons for the existence of zoos, they probably should not be allowed to continue into the twenty-first century. Despite the positive efforts of some zoos, the suffering experienced by animals in captivity is simply unacceptable.\n\n1 Plan\nIntroduction\nGeneral topic:\nThe way animals are treated in captivity and the role of zoos in modern society.\nFocus: Whether zoos are cruel and unnecessary in the 21st century.\nIssues to discuss:\nShould zoos be closed because they no longer serve a useful purpose, or do they still provide important benefits?\nMy initial position:\nAlthough some people believe zoos are cruel and outdated, I disagree because they continue to play an essential role in conservation, education, and scientific research.\nThemes:\nConservation of endangered species\nEducation and public awareness\nScientific research and animal welfare\nSide A (Agree - zoos are cruel an unnescessary)\nmain topic:\nZoos are outdated institutions that no longer have a justifiable role in the 21st century\n1 conservation\nZoos claim to conserve animals, but many species kept in zoos are not endangered. Resources would be better spent protecting habitats.\n2 education\nIn the 21st century, people can learn through documentaries and VR instead of confining animals\n3 Animal welfare\nAnimals in zoos are confined and can develop stress behavior\nWhat did i show or prove? link to the question\nTogether, these points suggest that zoos may be seen as cruel and less relevant in the 21st century, since their conservation claims are limited, modern technology provides alternative education, and captivity can harm animal welfare.\nSide B (Disagree - zoos are still nesecessary)\nmain topic: Despite criticisms, zoos remain necessary in the 21st century because they continue to play a vital role in conservation, education, and animal welfare. 1 conservation\nHowever, zoos have had major conservation successes (e.g. pandas). For some species, the wild is no longer safe, so zoos are essential\n2 education\nseeing real animals in zoos has a stronger emotional impact, especially on children, leading to long-term awareness and conservation support\n3 animal welfare\nmodern zoos focus on welfare, with large enclosures and enrichment activities, unlike circuses or outdated facilities\nLink to the question:\nOverall, these arguments demonstrate that zoos continue to serve an important purpose today by protecting endangered species, providing unique educational experiences, and ensuring high standards of animal welfare.\nConclusion - Summary of my main points While critics argue that zoos are outdated, unnecessary for conservation, and harmful to animals, they in fact continue to protect endangered species, educate the public, and maintain high standards of welfare.\nQuestion to answer Are zoos cruel and unnecessary in the 21st century? My final position I disagree – zoos remain necessary today for conservation, education, and welfare.\n\n\n2 Essay\nThe way animals are treated in captivity and the role of zoos in modern society have long been debated. Some people argue that zoos are cruel and unnecessary in the 21st century, while others believe they continue to provide important benefits. Although some people view zoos as outdated institutions, this essay disagrees with that view, as they remain essential for social purposes.\nOn the one hand, critics argue that zoos no longer have a justifiable role in today’s world. Firstly, although zoos claim to conserve animals, many of the species they house are not endangered. From this perspective, the money and effort invested in maintaining these facilities could be better spent protecting natural habitats, where conservation has a broader and more lasting effect. Secondly, the educational value of zoos is often questioned. With the development of modern technology, such as documentaries, interactive media, and virtual reality, people can learn about wildlife without the need to confine animals. Finally, animal welfare is a major concern. Even in large enclosures, animals remain restricted, and some develop stress-related or abnormal behaviors. Together, these points suggest that zoos may be seen as cruel and less relevant in the 21st century.\nOn the other hand, there are strong reasons to argue that zoos are still necessary. In terms of conservation, zoos have had real success in protecting species such as the giant panda and the black rhino, both of which might have faced extinction without intervention. For certain animals, the wild is no longer safe due to poaching, deforestation, and climate change, making captive breeding programs vital. Education is another important function. Seeing animals in real life has a much stronger emotional impact than watching them on a screen, particularly for children. This direct experience can create empathy and inspire long-term commitment to protecting wildlife. In addition, modern zoos have greatly improved in terms of animal welfare. They provide spacious enclosures, enrichment activities, and specialist veterinary care, making them fundamentally different from the exploitative conditions found in circuses or poorly managed facilities. Overall, these arguments demonstrate that zoos continue to serve an important purpose today.\nIn summary, while critics argue that zoos are outdated, unnecessary for conservation, and harmful to animals, they in fact continue to protect endangered species, educate the public, and maintain high standards of welfare. Therefore, in my view, zoos remain necessary in the 21st century for their vital role in conservation, education, and animal welfare."

    "title": "IELTS Essay Financial Matters",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Question:\nIn numerous nations, there is a growing trend for individuals to frequently discuss financial matters, such as their earnings or expenditure, in everyday conversation. What are the reasons behind this phenomenon? Is it advantageous or detrimental?\n\nThere is an increasing tendency for individuals in the modern world to openly discuss their finances in daily conversation. In my opinion, this is a result of a general lack of self-awareness and is decidedly negative given the opportunity cost it engenders.\nThe primary reason many people are prone to talk their financial dealings originates in society generally. In the past, a sense of modesty or concern for decorum might have compelled reticence. Today, some of the most widely discussed topics in the media, online, in film, and in literature concern cryptocurrencies, the real estate market, stock equities, the price of gold, and other investments. A person discussing these matters is likely only interested in subtle boasting if venting frustrations without awareness of the emotions or engagement of their interlocutor. The result over time has been that many people have developed a shameless habit.\nIn my view, discussion finances often precludes a number of more worthwhile topics of conversation. Since the majority of useful financial research can be conducted online or done in professional settings, there are more pressing areas that should be discussed in daily life. For example, two friends having a conversation at a cafe would derive greater value from telling stories, joking with one another, or delving into a more serious topic related to politics, the arts, or psychology. Such discussions are likely to develop their understanding of the world and their emotional intelligence. Discussion of money, on the other hand, wastes valuable time and energy for little concrete outcome.\nIn conclusion, the inclination to speak of one’s personal finances stems from a fundamentally modern self-indulgence and often prevents the discussion of more enjoyable or meaningful topics. Naturally, these generalizations do not apply to all individuals.\n\nChatGPT’s essay:\nIn numerous nations, a growing trend has emerged where people openly discuss financial matters, including their earnings and expenditures, in everyday conversations. This phenomenon can be attributed to a range of social and economic factors, and i firmly believe that it is advantageous. Open dialogue about personal finances not only foster financial literacy but also encourages better money management and transparency within communities.\nOne primary reason for this trend is the rapid spread of financial education and the influence of digital media. With the advent of social media platforms and financial blogs, individuals have unprecedented access to information about budgeting, investing, and saving. This exposure has led many to feel more confident in discussing their financial situations, as they seek advice and validation from peers. Additionally, economic uncertainty in many regions has prompted individuals to share personal financial experiences as a way of coping and learning from one another. For instance, during periods of economic downturn, people often exchange tips on reducing expenses or finding alternative income sources. This collective sharing not only helps individuals navigate challenging time but also creates a support network where practical financial strategies are exchanged openly.\nThe open discussion of financial matters carries significant benefits for both individuals and society at large. Firstly, it promotes financial literacy by normalizing conversations about money, which can demystify complex financial topic and empower people to make informed decisions. As people become more knowledgeable about financial planning and investment strategies, they are better equipped to secure their futures and contribute to economic growth. Secondly, this trend encourages transparency and accountability, reducing the stigma around discussing personal finances. For example, when individuals talk about budgeting and debt management, it can inspire others to examine their own spending habits, ultimately leading to a more financially responsible community. By fostering an environment where financial struggles and successes are shared openly, society as a whole benefits from improved financial stability and reduced inequality.\nIn conclusion, the increasing tendency for individuals to discuss financial matters in everyday conversation is driven by greater access to information and a need for mutual support during uncertain economic times. I contend that this development is advantageous, as it enhances financial literacy, transparency, and responsible money management. Ultimately, such open dialogue can empower communities to achieve greater financial stability and economic well-being.\n\nGrammar structures\n\nComplex Sentence Structures\n\nUse of subordinate clauses to add detail. Example: “With the advent of social media platforms and financial blog, individuals have unprecedented access to information about budgeting, investing, and saving.”\n\nCause and Effect Constructions\n\nPhrases such as “can be attributed to” and “leads to” explain reasons and consequences. Example: “This phenomenon can be attributed to a range of social and economic factors.”\n\nConditional and Hypothetical Phrasing:\n\nImplicit conditionals that suggest potential outcomes or benefits. Example: “when individuals talk about budgeting and debt management, it can inspire others to examine their own spending habits.”\n\nComparative Structure:\n\nUsing comparisons to show differences in outcomes. Example: “For instance, during periods of economic downturn, people often exchange tips on reducing expenses or finding alternative income sources.”\n\nUse of Passive Voice:\n\nPassive constructions to emphasize processes or outcomes rather than actors.\nExample: “This phenomenon can be attributed to a range of social and economic factors.”\n\nLinking Devices and Transitional Phrases:\n\nWords and phrases such as “Firstly,” “Secondly,” “In conclusion,” and “For example” to organize ideas and guide the reader.\n\n\n\n\nLexical Items\n\nAdvanced Vocabulary:\n\nWords such as “unprecedented,” “demystify,” “transparency,” “accountability,” and “empower” elevate the formality and clarity of the argument.\n\nFinancial Terminology:\n\nSpecific terms related to finance like “budgeting,” “investing,” “saving,” “financial literacy,” “debt management,” and “spending habits.”\n\nDescriptive Adjectives:\n\nTerms that add detail and nuance, for example “open dialogue,” “collective sharing,” “rigorous, random testing,” and “financially responsible.”\n\nCollocations and Fixed Phrases:\n\nCommon phrases that support the essay’s theme such as “financial matters,” “economic uncertainty,” “personal financial experiences,” and “mutual support.”\n\nTransitional Vocabulary:\n\nWords that link ideas logically like “furthermore,” “additionally,” and “ultimately” ensure smooth progression throughout the essay.\n\nOpinion and Evaluation Language:\n\nPhrases that express clear stance such as “I firmly believe,” “it is essential,” “I contend that,” and “I contend that this development is advantageous.”"

    "text": "In spite of the advances made in agriculture, many people around the world still go hungry. Why is this the case? What can be done about this problem? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own experience or knowledge. Write at least 250 words.\n\nRecent years have witnessed tremendous developments in agricultural science yet every day people all over the world continue to suffer and even die from hunger. In my opinion, this is because innovations rarely impact the developing world and the best solution for it is to direct humanitarian funding towards these advances.\nThe main cause of more advanced agricultural methods not reaching the people who need it the most is that the developing world has trouble implementing these methods. There are a number of reasons for this ranging from limited financial resources to poor existing infrastructure to political instability, depending on the country in question. One example of this would be in many African nations, where malnourishment has historically been highest. Countries like the Congo have seen revolution after revolution over the last several decades, which has effectively destabilized the entire country. The universities where students would learn about changes in agriculture are frequently shut down or destroyed. The young people who would become agricultural scientists end up drawn into the conflict as soldiers or victims. Long-term economic neglect means that the government has very limited ability to subsidies farming. These problems are present to varying degrees in countries around the world and offer one possible explanation for the continued prevalence of hunger.\nThe solution that I believe would be most effective is directing humanitarian funds previously focused on food aid towards education and agriculture. Food aid is a notoriously poor solution because it only offers an immediate solution and warlords often exploit it to support their continued mistreatment of their people. It hurts more than it helps. However, there would be better long-term effects if international organizations and governments redirects that money into helping build better farms, provide more modern equipment, and sending qualified professions to train people in need. There is a TedTalk by a young man in Kenya who built his own windmill out of old bicycle parts and reading a book in the local library. It is large enough to power irrigation channels for the entire village. If more people like him can be found or trained when this will have an impact that lasts for decades and is relatively impervious to the factors preventing agricultural advances from taking root in developing countries.\nIn conclusion, developing companies face myriad problems that hinder their ability to take advantage of newer agricultural models and we should direct more funding to helping these countries learn more about new farming methods. This is likely to be an important issue in the world as the gap between rich and poor, developed and undeveloped widens while technological progress continues its indifferent march forward.\n\n1 Key Academic Vocabulary\nNouns/nominalisations: developments, innovations, humanitarian funding, infrastructure, instability, malnourishment, subsidies, exploitation, irrigation, prevalence, technological progress\nVerbs: suffer, destabilize, implement, exploit, redirect, power, widen\nAdjectives/adverbs: tremendous, advanced, limited, poor, political, historical(ly), immediate, long-term, modern, qualified, relative(ly), impervious, indifferent\n\n\n2 Linking & Signposting Phrases\nContrast: yet, however, but\nCause/Reason: because, depending on, due to\nExample: one example (of this) would be\nCondition: if…, then…\nAddition/Sequence: and, also\nConclusion: in conclusion\n\n\n3 Grammar Structures\nComplex sentences with multiple clauses:\n“There are a number of reasons for this ranging from X to Y…”\n“The universities where students would learn… are frequently shut down.”\nRelative clauses: “countries where…”, “…methods that…”\nConditionals (first): “If more people like him can be found…, this will have an impact.”\nPassive voice: “are frequently shut down or destroyed.”\nNominalisation to pack information: “the continued prevalence of hunger.”\n\n\n4 Sentence-building Techniques\nTopic sentence → elaboration → example in each body paragraph\nBalance of simple/simple-compound sentences (“However, there would be better long-term effects…” vs. “It is large enough to power irrigation channels for the entire village.”)\nAbstract–Concrete pairing: stating a general problem then giving a vivid, specific case (Congo revolutions; Kenyan windmill)."

Whenever you state your opinion or present a point, you are effectively making an argument and offering a conclusion.\nThis is directly connected to the Task Response criterion in the IELTS Band Descriptors. For example:\n\nBand 6: “The conclusions may become unclear.”\n\nThis happens when the points in your body paragraphs are:\n\nNot well supported\nPoorly explained\nDisconnected from the overall argument\n\n\n\n\nAn argument is a statement provided as evidence to show that another statement — the conclusion — is true. The main ideas or points in your body paragraphs should always be structured this way to form a strong, logical essay.\nIn later lessons, these paragraph-level arguments will be referred to as points or main ideas, but it’s important to understand that each one must function as an argument: a reasoned statement that leads to a clear conclusion.\n\n\n\nAlthough our main ideas will generally be explained over several sentences within a paragraph, we’ll begin by looking at a simple one-sentence argument:\nFruit contains vitamin C, which helps keep us healthy, so the government should encourage everyone to eat more fruit.\nTo demonstrate that this is an argument, we can seperate it into a conclusion and the reasons given for believing it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nConclusion: The government should encourage everyone to eat more fruit.\nReason 1) fruit contains vitamin C\nReason 2) vitamin C helps to keep us healthy\n\n\n\n\n\n1 The conclusion does not always come after the reasons. This means that we can also write:\nThe government should encourage everyone to eat more fruit because it contains vitamin C, which is good for health.\nEven though the order has changed, the conclusion remains the same: the government should encourage everyone to eat more fruit.\n2 Each reason in this argument is called a ‘premise’, which means a claim being made by the writer. The writer is asking the reader to accept these claims (that fruit contains vitamin C, and vitamin C helps keep us healthy) are true, and that they are good enough reasons to conclude that the government should encourage everyone to eat more fruit. When we are writing, we need to make sure that our claims are true (or at least believable), and that they know the reader that our conclusions are reasonable.\n3 We are giving our position every time we make an argument like this one. This mean that we do not need to write I believe; I think; In my view to make our position clear; whether our position remains clear or not will depend on the language we use, and the reasons we provide to support it.

Making a Point Without a Reason\nStating a conclusion without explaining why you believe it leads to weak writing.\nExample: &gt; The government should encourage everyone to eat more fruit.\nThis is a conclusion, but it lacks a reason. The reader is left wondering: - Why should the government do this? - What benefit does this have?\n\n\n3.1.2 2. Giving a Reason That Doesn’t Support the Conclusion\nSometimes a writer includes a reason or example, but it does not logically support the conclusion.\nExample: &gt; The government should encourage everyone to eat more fruit.\n&gt; For example, a BBC documentary showed that 85% of people eat fruit.\nThis fact (even if true) does not explain or support the conclusion. It fails to show why the government should promote fruit consumption. In many cases, the example is also clearly invented and adds confusion instead of clarity.\nThese types of errors are very common in student essays and are a key reason for a band 6 score in Task Response."

    "title": "Guide Test Practice 1 - Data about People",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Some answers to this question reveal a common problem with data tasks: drawing the wrong conclusions about what the data tell us. As we saw in lessons 1 and 3, this can present problems for TA score.\nTo understand the issue, think about where the data in the bar chart has come from. Data about people and how they live generally comes from some sort of survey, where people answer personal questions. Our current data would be based on the answer to one question.\nWhich of the following questions could have produced the data in the bar chart above?\nA. Are you planning to buy or rent a house in the future?\nB. Where do you live now?\nC. Do you live in a house or a flat?\nD. Do you rent or own your home?\nE. Would you prefer to own a home or rent?\nF. Where did you live before you moved to this house\nThe only question that fits the data in this charts is Option D: Do you rent or own your home?\nThis means we do not have any information about where people moved from, or what their living preferences are. Yet some people write sentences like this:\nIt is clear from the chart that owned accommodation become more popular in the final 4 decades.\nTo be able to say that something is ‘more popular’, we would need to ask a different question in the survey in the survey. With our current data, we can only say that home ownership was more common in the later years. We do not know if the people concerned preferred or chose to rent - they may have been forced through circumstances (e.g. a lack of money or job). If homelessness was increasing, we would not say that it was becoming ‘more popular’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAlways think about what the data actually tells us - what question does it answer? Avoid using the words popular, favorite, or choice unless the data answers a question such as ‘Which do you prefer / enjoy?’ OR where it is clear that a choice has been made.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data in this chart is from 9 different years, so the same question would need to be asked in each of these years. The first year is 1918 and the last year is 2011, which means this data covers a period of 93 years. Do you think the people who were asked this question in 1918 are the same people answering the question in 2011? I think you’ll agree this is highly unlikely. What about between 1971 and 1991? Again, we do not know. This tells us another important point: the data set for each year can tell us about general trends within the population of England and Wales, but it does not tell us about the movements of individual people. Therefore, we can’t draw conclusions like this:\nHowever, over the next 40 years, more and more residents managed to buy their own place and moved out of rented accommodation.\nThis is going too far. We don’t know whether the people who said they owned their home in 1991 and moved out of rental accommodation - we do not have data for this. They could be people who have just moved to the area after selling a house somewhere else, they could have lived with their parents until they could afford to buy a house, someone may have given the house to them. The increased numbers of home owners may be due to housing becoming cheaper and easier to buy, government support, or many more homes being built in the area. We do not know, so we cannot make statements about this is our answer.\n\n\n\nWe need to present clear, logical evidence to support the points we make. The same idea applies in writing task 1. IF we make a statement such as ‘more and more resident moved out of rented accommodation’, then we need to be sure we can supply evidence from the data we are given to support this. If there is no evidence in the data about people moving house, then the statement is not relevant to the task.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThink carefully about what the data actually shows and make sure to only write about what we can prove in the data\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to see the data set for each year in the graph as a separate set of people answering the survey question, and we shouldn’t try to connect the data in a cause and effect way. This is an important point in interpreting data, and a fact that is often repeated in academic writing that: correlation (two things matching or occurring at the same time) should not be seen as causation (one thing being directly related to or caused by another)\n\nThe increases in ice cream sales correspond with increases in sun burn but this is correlation not causation - both just happen to occur in summer or hot weather.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nDon’t try to find a connection between the data sets - we will not have enough information for this. We can talk about the data ‘corresponding’, but we should not relate them directly or invent a story about what is happening.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis task presents some language challenges, especially as only 2 variables are mentioned (renting a home or living in a home you own). This means we need to try to avoid repeating the same words and phrases and we need to use different words to those in the question when possible. Remember, we do not need to vary this every time, sometimes a key word is unavoidable. We just need to reduce the number of times we repeat the same terms.\nOne way to do this is to vary the way we present the data. We can either write about the figures in the chart, or about the people behind the data. Look at the following examples, which all present the same fact:\n\nThe figure for rented accommodation fell from just under 80% in 1918 to less than 70% in 1939.\nThe percentage of people renting accommodation fell from just under 80% in 1918 to less than 70% in 1939.\nFewer people rented accommodation in 1918 than in 1939 (just under 80% and 70% respectively)\n\nMake sure to think about the people behind the statistic, and what the data presents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBe careful to vary our sentences - don’t always refer just to the figures and what happens to the data. Think about the people that these numbers represent as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough this question refers to ‘households’, this does not mean the people all lived in houses - they may have rented or owned a flat. A household refers to the group of people all living together within the same place - whether it is a house or flat. The word ‘home’ covers this nicely as a home refers to the place where we live, whether that is a tent, a boat, a flat, or a house.\n\n\n\nThe word ‘own’ often creates problems because of its different meanings and uses. For example, to own is a verb meaning to have something that legally belongs to us; own is also a pronoun, or can be used to mean ‘alone’\nThe verb ‘to own’ is not used in the same way as the verb ‘to possess’, which has a much stronger meaning and is not appropriate in this context. Another important fact about the verb ‘to own’ is that it is a ‘stative’ verb, this mean it cannot be used in a continuous tense. So, we cannot say, ‘More people were owning their home’. However, we can talk about ‘owning a home’ (the noun form of the verb), and we can also talk about ‘ownership’ and ‘home ownership’ (you will find this written as separate words, hyphenated, or as one word).\nLook at the following sentences and decide whether the word ‘own’ is a verb, a pronoun, or means ‘alone’.\n\nThat family is very rich, they live in a huge house and also own 10 properties that they rent out. (verb)\nI didn’t get my project finished because my family arrived and I couldn’t get any time on my own. (alone)\nI still live with my parents, I can’t wait to have my own home. (pronoun)\n\nConsider also that, if we rent a property, someone owns it. The wording in the question and the chart is a little unhelpful here as it refers to ‘owned accommodation’ and ‘rented accommodation’. This works with ‘accommodation’ as the context is clear. But people are often tempted to write ‘living in an owned house / property’, which does not work. We need to write ‘the percentage of people living in their own home’ not ‘living in an owned home’\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVocabulary note:\n\n\n\nSector, market, category\nThese words are useful umbrella terms to use as synonyms to avoid repetition.\nSector = and area of economic activity (similar to ‘field’ in the academic world). Examples of sector are: the banking sector; the tourism sector; the housing sector\nMarket = business or trade in a specific product (e.g. the rental market; the housing market)\nCategory = a group, or system of grouping similar information or things.\n\n\nIf you haven’t already done so, write an answer to this question. Remember the following key steps\n\n\n\n\nSpend a few moments noticing the details in the bar chart. Pay attention to what is being measured as well as when, and how is it being measured.\nIdentify the key trends in the data and think about how to write about these in our overview. Remember - we should not mention just one trend.\nThink about: what stayed the same, what changed, what comparisons can be made.\nGroup the information together so that we can write about it logically. Chronological order is the clearest and most logical. Remember to make comparisons where relevant.\nOur paragraphs should cover one main idea (e.g. The data for renting) and this should be clear to the reader.\nAs we write, remember to vary our tenses and our sentences structures.\n\n\nwrite\nintro\nThe chart shows the statistics of owning and renting accommodation of family on England and Wales from 1918 to 2011.\noverview\npeople own home are more and more common from time intersect at 1971\np2 own\np1 rented\nhave a mild decrease from 1918 to 1953, then drop rapid to 2001 before rose again in 2011\nThe chart shows the statistics of owning and renting accommodation of families in England and Wales from 1918 to 2011. Overall, people tend to lean more towards having their own properties as renting a house becomes less and less common.\nIn 1918, owned accommodations were less common, with just over 20% of people. This figure grew rapidly to 50% in 1971 and overtook the proportion of households in rented accommodations. The proportion of family living in their own home continued to rise to the peak of nearly 70% in 2011 before slightly dropping in 2011.\nOn the other hand, the figure for rented accommodations began the period with a dominant percentage, at nearly 4 times that of owned home in 1918. There was a mild fluctuation in the proportion in the figure of those renting home in 1918 and 1953. The period between 1953 and 2001 experienced a gradual drop in the figure, with just over 30% at the end of the period, before a small rising in 2011.\n\nThe chart illustrates the proportion of households in England and Wales that owned or rented accommodation between 1918 and 2011. Overall, the data shows a clear shift from renting to owning, with ownership becoming the dominant trend after the early 1970s.\nIn 1918, home ownership was relatively uncommon, accounting for just over 20% of households. This figure rose steadily throughout the period, reaching around 50% by 1971, at which point it overtook the share of rented homes. Ownership continued to increase, peaking at nearly 70% in 2001, before experiencing a slight decline in 2011.\nBy contrast, renting was the predominant form of housing in 1918, at almost four times the level of ownership. The percentage of renters fluctuated mildly between 1918 and 1953 but then fell consistently over the following decades, dropping to just over 30% by 2001. A small rebound occurred in 2011, although renting remained significantly less common than owning."

Remember to make comparisons where relevant.\nOur paragraphs should cover one main idea (e.g. The data for renting) and this should be clear to the reader.\nAs we write, remember to vary our tenses and our sentences structures.\n\n\nwrite\nintro\nThe chart shows the statistics of owning and renting accommodation of family on England and Wales from 1918 to 2011.\noverview\npeople own home are more and more common from time intersect at 1971\np2 own\np1 rented\nhave a mild decrease from 1918 to 1953, then drop rapid to 2001 before rose again in 2011\nThe chart shows the statistics of owning and renting accommodation of families in England and Wales from 1918 to 2011. Overall, people tend to lean more towards having their own properties as renting a house becomes less and less common.\nIn 1918, owned accommodations were less common, with just over 20% of people. This figure grew rapidly to 50% in 1971 and overtook the proportion of households in rented accommodations. The proportion of family living in their own home continued to rise to the peak of nearly 70% in 2011 before slightly dropping in 2011.\nOn the other hand, the figure for rented accommodations began the period with a dominant percentage, at nearly 4 times that of owned home in 1918. There was a mild fluctuation in the proportion in the figure of those renting home in 1918 and 1953. The period between 1953 and 2001 experienced a gradual drop in the figure, with just over 30% at the end of the period, before a small rising in 2011.\n\nThe chart illustrates the proportion of households in England and Wales that owned or rented accommodation between 1918 and 2011. Overall, the data shows a clear shift from renting to owning, with ownership becoming the dominant trend after the early 1970s.\nIn 1918, home ownership was relatively uncommon, accounting for just over 20% of households. This figure rose steadily throughout the period, reaching around 50% by 1971, at which point it overtook the share of rented homes. Ownership continued to increase, peaking at nearly 70% in 2001, before experiencing a slight decline in 2011.\nBy contrast, renting was the predominant form of housing in 1918, at almost four times the level of ownership. The percentage of renters fluctuated mildly between 1918 and 1953 but then fell consistently over the following decades, dropping to just over 30% by 2001. A small rebound occurred in 2011, although renting remained significantly less common than owning."

    "text": "1.2 Stages and trends\nAs we saw in lesson 9, process tasks have stages rather than trends, and it is these stages that we must highlight in our body paragraphs and summarise in our overview. We identity a trend by looking at the beginning point in the data. A common problem in process tasks is that, in their overview, candidates often mention only the first and the last stage in the process, thus confusing a stage with a trend. Look at the following example:\nThe process consists of seven steps of various time length, starting by farming sugar canes and ending by dry sugar ready to use.\nIt not very helpful here.\nThere is an overview presented in the first paragraph which summaries the process into the farming stages and the drying stages. This summary could be more detailed, e.g. farming, crushing, separating and drying stages.\nIt is true that this is not a complete or clear overview because we do not get a clear picture of what happens between the farming of the sugar canes and the dry sugar at the end. However, the use of the word ‘detailed’ is unfortunate here. It would have been better to say that the overview needs to include more information in order to be a clear or complete overview.\nListing four of the steps in the diagram as example (e.g. farming, crushing, separating, and drying stages) also suggests you should include these words in our overview, which is not a good idea as they are given in the question. Later in this lesson we will look at how to avoid using words from the question paper, which is very important. In PC view, this advice is better expressed as follows: There is an overview presented in the first paragraph which mentions two stage: farming and drying. A clearer summary would give an overview of the main stages rather than just the first and the last steps in the process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn a process task, be very careful not to just copy the words and phrases used in the diagram."

    "text": "1.4 Steps and stages\nIn lesson 4.2, PC recommended asking ourselves questions about a diagram, like this:\nQ: What are being shown here? A: This diagram is showing the steps involved in …\nA step is one part of a process. Here are some useful phrases with the word ‘step’:\n\nWhen learning a new skill, it is best to do it one step at a time. = (slowly and deliberately)\nI will explain what you need to do step by step. (=giving instruction in a logical order)\nChanging the resources you need to use to practice is a step in the right decision. (= a good starting point)\n\nThe word ‘stage’ has a broader meaning:\nWe’re renovating the house in stages, we’ll start with the downstairs areas, then do the upstairs rooms, and finally the area outside the house.\nThis mean than we can say that the diagram shows seven steps in a process, but we can also group these steps into key stages. This is very helpful in producing a clear overview, but we need ask a second question:\nQ 1: What are we being shown here? Ans: The diagram shows the steps involved in a process.\nQ 2: What are main stages in this process?\nLooking carefully at the diagram will help. One easy way to decide a ‘main stage’ is to look at the product or material being processed and noticing when it changes in form (e.g. from a plant to a juice). This means that, we need to notice:\n\nWhat type of process it is (e.g. mechanical, manual)\nHow many steps there are\nWhere the process takes place\nthe product and how it changes\nwhether any of the steps can be grouped together into key stages\n\nIn our current diagram there are seven steps numbered 1-7, but they are not all equal. Some are important separate stages (growing, harvesting) while others are smaller steps in a part of the process (purifying, evaporating, separating). Looking at how the product changes (from sugar canes, to juice, to syrup, then sugar) helps to group these together so that we can summarize them in a clear overview.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWe can identify the main stages by grouping steps together. Remember, we are always looking for the main changes, so looking at when the product changes form can also help.\nFor example: the plant -&gt; juice -&gt; syrup -&gt; sugar\n\n\nPC’s note for this step\n\nFor her overview, she identified two main stages 1) the growing and harvesting the crop and 2) the processing of the juice from canes to produce sugar. To make sure our overview is ‘complete’ and ‘clear’, we can include the following\n\nthe type of process\nhow many stages there are and what these are (using umbrella terms)\nwhat happens during the process (without giving too much detail) i.e. the main changes\n\nAlthough we can’t avoid giving some details here (e.g. sugar cane and sugar) try to avoid giving too many other details in this overview. Write our version below then compare it to her later when we look at her model.\n\n1.4.1 Overview Practice\nTry to predict what PC overview will look like by writing an overview statement that includes the following information:\n\nthe type of process\nthe number of stages and what they are (use umbrella terms)\nwhat happens during the process (avoid giving too much detail here)\n\nlinear process 2 stages farming, and processing\nOverall, the linear process consists of two main stages, including sugar cane farming and processing of juice to produce sugar. # Changing the language in the question\nProcess tasks generally have more language on the question paper than other tasks. This helps us to understand what is happening but it also means we need to be careful: in order to show our language skills, we need to avoid just copying the language on the diagram.\nThe different steps in the process are labelled, usually with the noun form of a verbs (the ing form). For example, growing, harvesting, crushing, purifying, evaporating, drying and cooling. Steps 5 and 6 in our current diagram are unusual. Rather than adding more detail to the diagram (e.g. showing and labelling the syrup and the centrifuge), the question is tell us that, in step 5 ‘juice becomes syrup’ and in step 6 the centrifuge ‘separates sugar crystals from syrup’. So we have even more language to avoid copying here.\nRepetition is another common problem in process tasks, as it is easy to use the same grammatical structures repeatedly. To solve these problems, use the language points below to build our vocabulary and our grammatical range and accuracy."

Overall, this is a largely mechanical process comprising two main stages: the farming of sugar cane and the processing of the crop, which turns it into a liquid and eventually into sugar.\nThe first stage of the process is the longest as the sugar cane takes between 12 to 18 months to grow tall enough for harvesting. Once it is fully grown, the crop can be harvested in two ways, either mechanically using specialist machinery or by hand, a much more labour-intensive method.\nThe second stage is wholly mechanical and involves five steps. First, the plants are crushed to form a juice, which is then extracted. The juice is purified by passing it through a limestone filter before being heated. During this step, the liquid content of the juice evaporates leaving behind a syrup. The syrup is then put in a centrifuge and spun at a high enough speed to separate out the sugar crystals, which are subsequently dried and cooled to produce the final product."

Overall, this is a linear and partly mechanical process that requires at least twelve months and can be divided into three main stages: cultivation, extraction and purification, and crystallisation with drying.\nIn the first stage, sugar cane plants are cultivated for a period of 12 to 18 months until they reach maturity. Once this has occurred, they are harvested either manually or using mechanical equipment. The stalks are then crushed to extract juice, which is subsequently purified through a limestone filter to remove any unwanted residue.\nFollowing this, the filtered juice is boiled in order to evaporate excess water and is converted into syrup. This syrup undergoes centrifugation, during which sugar crystals are separated from the remaining liquid. In the final stage, the crystals are dried and cooled, producing refined sugar ready for distribution."

    "text": "4.1 Speaking\n\n4.1.1 Do you enjoy spending time alone?\n(Using muse as a verb) Yes, I do enjoy time alone, especially when I can sit quietly and muse about different ideas. It helps me reflect on my goals and sometimes come up with creative solutions or even new plans for the future.\n\n\n4.1.2 Do you ever write a diary or journals?\n(Using muse as a noun) Yes, I write in a journal regularly. It’s mostly filled with personal thoughts and random musings about life, people I meet, or even things I read. I find it helps me process my emotions and clears my mind.\n\n\n4.1.3 Some people believe that creativity is as important as academic skills.\nMany creative breakthroughs begin with quiet musings, as people reflect deeply before arriving at unique ideas.\n\n\n4.1.4 Modern life is often too fast-paced for personal reflection\nIn today’s busy world, people rarely have the time to muse on their own experiences, which may reduce self-awareness and emotional clarity.\n\n\n4.1.5 Do people today spend enough time thinking deeply?\nHonestly, I don’t think so. Life today is fast-paced, and people are often distracted by social media or constant notifications. Deep thinking requires space and silence, and most people rarely take time to just sit and muse about important questions or life decisions. I think that kind of reflection is crucial for personal growth.\n\n\n4.1.6 Why do some people enjoy writing journals or personal blogs?\nI think it’s partly because writing helps people process their thoughts. For many, a journal is a private place to record their musings about daily life or future goals. It’s also a way to make sense of emotions. Even blogs, which are more public, often start from personal reflection.\n\n\n4.1.7 Is creativity important in education?\nDefinitely. While academic skills are essential, creativity allows students to explore ideas in original ways. Some of the best innovations come from people who took time to muse on a problem from a different perspective. Encouraging students to think creatively also makes learning more meaningful.\n\n\n4.1.8 Do you think quiet time is necessary for creativity?\nYes, I believe it’s vital. Creative thinking often comes from calm, undistracted moments - those quiet times when you’re not actively working, but your mind is still turning over ideas. Many artists or writers have said their best thoughts came during moments of musing, like walking alone or staring out the window."

In fact, many great inventions and solutions have come from individuals who took time to muse on a problem from a new angle, rather than simply recalling facts. Moreover, encouraging students to record their musings in journals or through art can foster emotional intelligence and personal growth - qualities that are just as vital as academic skills in today’s world."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The choice will depend on the ideas that occur to us when planning our essay - it cannot be decided in advance. This is because our ideas shape our argument, which then determines the language we must use. This cannot happen in reverse, beginning with the language, which is why a fixed template approach will not work.\nWhen creating an argument:\n\nOne way to build a clear argument is by presenting the different reasons that, when added together, led us to our conclusion. In our planning, we can use plus sign (+) to show arguments like this.\nWords and phrases often used in this type or argument are:\nFirstly, Secondly, Thirdly, In addition, Similarly, also, etc.\nWe will look at a model and use critical thinking to identity the ideas within the argument and to understand how the ideas are connected.\n\n\nLook at the argument being made in the paragraph below and try to identify 3 points or ideas (PC’s conclusion) and 3 reasons given for believing them. (Mentally adding ‘because’, or ‘therefore’ can help us identify a reason or conclusion - this is helpful for IELTS reading too)\nThere are several reasons why the government collects taxes. Firstly, the money raised can be used to build new roads or public buildings. Secondly, existing infrastructure, such as schools and hospitals, can be updated or repaired. Finally, these funds are needed to pay the salaries of all government workers, including firefighters and the police. Thus, taxes help improve the community while also making it safer.\n\nThe ‘evidence’ is the reason why her believe a conclusion is valid or reasonable, so the three reasons given in this paragraph are her supporting evidence. She used her experience and knowledge of the world to think of these, which is what the task tells us to do. The conclusions, or the points she make, are her personal views about what this evidence shows or tells us. Remember, each of these conclusions, or points, reveals her position on this issue - if the reasons she give to support are unclear or illogical (as we saw in the previous lesson), then her position and conclusions will also be unclear. If this evidence is missing, her ideas will be both unclear and undeveloped.\nThe points she make (her conclusion) are broad, general ideas (e.g. Taxes help make the community safer). In contrast, the reasons given are more specific, and they provide concrete supporting evidence to support her ideas (e.g. Taxes are used to pay the salaries of firefighters). Notice also that she was able to provide supporting evidence without using the phrases ‘For example’. We will review this idea in Lesson 6.\nNotice her use of referencing in this paragraph (the way that she refer back to previous ideas). In the practice exercise, she used the word ‘taxes’ repeatedly, by if we look at her paragraph, we will see that she used synonyms to avoid repeating this word. This helps with our Coherence and cohesion score, and shows how building our vocabulary helps improve our writing score.\n\nTwo words are used as synonyms to refer back to ‘taxes’: money, funds\nInfrastructure refers to public services such as water, transport, rubbish collection etc.\nSalaries refer to the money paid to workers. ## Adding emphasis\nThe language used in this argument tells the reader that each reason is equally important. However, we sometimes want to show that one reason is more important than the others, as in the following example.\nThere are several reasons why the government collects taxes. In terms of infrastructure, the money raised can be used to build new roads or public buildings, or to maintain existing structures such as schools and hospitals. More importantly, these funds are needed to pay the salaries of all government workers, including firefighters and the police. Thus, taxes not only help improve the community but also make it safer.\nThe phrases in bold are used to show her position, which can be summed up as: there are several good reasons for collecting taxes, and I believe that safety is the most important of these. Other phrases we may find useful when making an argument like this are:\nMoreover, Furthermore, What is more, Even more importantly.\nNotice that she did not use a connecting phrases between the first two sentences - the link between them is made clear through the use of referencing (‘the money raised’ refers back to ‘collects taxes’). As we have seen, some writers go even further, omitting even more connecting words and phrases. As well as removing clear signposting, this also creates a different tone in the writing, and sometimes goes too far.\nVersion 1:\nThere are several reasons why the government collects taxes. Firstly, the money raised can be used to build new roads or public buildings. Secondly, existing infrastructure, such as schools and hospitals, can be updated or repaired. Finally, these funds are needed to pay the salaries of all government workers, including firefighters and the police.\nVersion 2:\nThere are several reasons why the government collects taxes. The money raised can be used to build new roads or public buildings. Existing infrastructure, such as schools and hospitals, can be updated or repaired. The funds are needed to pay the salaries of all government workers, including firefighters and the police.\nSecond version is far more difficult for language learners to master.\nIn Version 2 the links are made clear through the use of synonyms (‘collects taxes’ in sentence 1 = ‘The money raised’ in sentence 2 and ‘these funds’ in sentence 3) The sentences are also connected through a common theme or context - each sentence provides a reason why the government collects taxes.\nSomething between these two:\nVersion 3:\nThere are several reasons why the government collects taxes. The money raised can be used to build new roads or public buildings. Existing infrastructure, such as schools and hospitals, can also be updated or repaired. Furthermore, the funds are needed to pay the salaries of all government workers, including firefighters and the police.\n\n\n\nMatch conclusion and point\nThe money can be used to build new roads or public buildings.\ntaxes pay the salaries of government workers including firefighters and the police\nexisting infrastructure such as schools and hospitals can be updated or repaired.\nall of the ideas in this paragraph\nConclusion 1: There are several reasons why governments collect taxes.\nConclusion 2: taxes help improve the community\nConclusion 3: taxes make the community safer.\n\nConclusion 2: taxes help improve the community -&gt; The money can be used to build new roads or public buildings., -&gt; -&gt; existing infrastructure such as schools and hospitals can be updated or repaired.\nC 3: taxes make the community safer. taxes pay the salaries of government workers including firefighters and the police\nC1: all of the ideas in this paragraph"

We are essentially saying: If (or when) X happens / happened, Y will / would / may / might / could (etc.) happen / happens as a result.\nWe can see these two clauses as the action and the result, or effect, of this action.\nThe different tenses used tell us how likely these actions and results (or effects) are.\nLook at the following sentences (1-6) and identify the action and the result.\n\nIf the government helps homeless people, this will solve all of their problems. (action: helps homeless people, result: all their problems are solved)\nWhen homeless people are given free accommodation, their health often improves as a result. (action: give free accommodation to homeless people, result: improve their health)\nIf the government built more affordable housing, this could improve the situation for many people.\nWhen homeless people have nowhere to shelter, winter is extremely difficult for them.\nVery few people would be upset if taxes were increased to help the homeless.\nIf people are unemployed for a long time, they can eventually become homeless.\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Q2\nLook at the tense used for each action in the sentences above and decide how likely it is to happen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthis happens in the real world\nthis is possible in the future\nthis is less likely to happen in the future\n\n\n\n\nIf the government helps homeless people, this will solve all of their problems.\n\nok\n\n\n\nWhen homeless people are given free accommodation, their health often improves as a result.\nok\n\n\n\n\nIf the government built more affordable housing, this could improve the situation for many people.\n\n\nok\n\n\nWhen homeless people have nowhere to shelter, winter is extremely difficult for them.\nok\n\n\n\n\nVery few people would be upset if taxes were increased to help the homeless.\n\n\nok\n\n\nIf people are unemployed for a long time, they can eventually become homeless.\nok\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the writer is telling us how likely these actions are through the use of the different tenses:\nIf + the simple present tells us this is possible in the future\nWhen + the simple present tells us this generally happens (If can also be used in other way:)\nIf + simple past tells us the writer thinks this is less likely to happen.\nFor sentences 1 and 6, we need to consider both clauses. In sentence 1, the use of ‘will solve’ tells us the writer is presenting a possible future action in the first clause (‘if the government helps’). In sentence 6, the second clause (‘can eventually become’) tells us the writer is presenting a real situation and not an imagined one.\n\n\n3.1.3 Q3\nNow look at the tense used for each result. How sure does the writer feel about each result?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n100% sure\n75% sure\n50% sure\n\n\n\n\n…this will solve all of their problems.\nok\n\n\n\n\n… their health often improves as a result.\nok\n\n\n\n\n… this could improve the situation for many people.\n\n\nok\n\n\n… winter is extremely difficult for them.\nok\n\n\n\n\nVery few people would be upset if taxes were increased to help the homeless.\nok\n\n\n\n\n… they can eventually become homeless.\nok\n\nok\n\n\n\nagain, the tenses used tell us how confident or sure the writer feels about this result. In conditional sentences (where the result is dependent on a previous action): - the simple present, will, and would all tell us the writer is 100% sure that this will / would result - the modal verbs may, could, might tell us the writer is only 50% sure, or sees this as just one possible result - adverbs (e.g. probably) and phrases such as ‘is likely to’ can be used to show 75% certainty that a result would or will probably happen or is likely to happen.\nBeing cautious\nIf the government helps homeless people, this … solve … of their problems.\n…, this could/ may /might/ is likely to solve many/ some/ most of their problems."

This is a very firm prediction about the result.\nWe can also say: ‘If A happened then B would result’. Although the first event is less likely to happen, we are still making a firm prediction about the result.

In formal writing, it is better to be more cautious about claims or predictions that we make.

Does the tense or verb accurately reflect how sure you feel about the result? (Think about your use of conditionals and modal verbs.) Make a note of any grammar points you need to study and make sure to practise these often. • If you have written any essays based on questions asking you to discuss the problems and solutions or the causes and effects of a problem, look at the body paragraphs in your essay and think about the following: • Can you Identify any claims you have made and the effects that you discussed? • How are the ideas in your argument connected? • How did you show this connection? • What improvements can you make?"

Consequently, the economic benefits can outweigh the cost.”\n\nStrengths:\n\nLogical cause–effect reasoning (“can create … lead to … outweigh the cost”).\nSmooth connector “Consequently”.\n\nImprovements:\n\n“Lead to benefits in the military industry” → unclear phrasing.\nBetter:\n\n“They also drive innovation in related industries, including defense and aerospace.”\n\n“Outweigh the cost” → good phrase, but could be more formal:\n\n“These economic gains often outweigh the initial financial investment.”\n\n\n\n\n\n1.5 ✅ \n\n\n1.6 Example\n\n“For example, there are new space tours for sale at a high price, and military industries are in enormous surplus in some countries, which can not be developed like now without the techniques from space programs.”\n\nStrengths:\n\nYou’re giving two real-world examples: space tourism + military tech.\nShows understanding of applied outcomes.\n\nImprovements:\n\nGrammar and phrasing need polishing:\n\n“for sale at a high price” → awkward → “space tourism has emerged as a profitable industry”.\n“enormous surplus” → unclear (military industry doesn’t usually produce “surplus”).\nBetter: “Some countries’ defense sectors have expanded rapidly thanks to technologies first developed for space missions.”\n“which can not be developed like now without” → should be “which could not have developed without…”\n\n\n✅ Improved example:\n\n“For example, space tourism has become a highly profitable industry, and many countries’ defense technologies have evolved directly from innovations first designed for space missions.”\n\n\n\n\n1.7 ✅ \n\n\n1.8 Second Idea: Scientific Research\n\n“In terms of scientific research, these programs can expand the frontier of knowledge. It can be applied to help human life.”\n\nStrengths:\n\nGood transition phrase “In terms of…”\nClear focus on science/knowledge → matches your topic sentence.\n\nImprovements:\n\n“It can be applied to help human life” → vague.\nBetter:\n\n“This new knowledge often leads to technologies that improve daily life.”\n\n\n\n\n\n1.9 ✅ \n\n\n1.10 Example + Link\n\n“Like the GPS system and satellites, which are products of previous projects that can be seen as a waste at first. Expanding human knowledge creates new opportunities for all people, which is why some people favor space exploration.”\n\nStrengths:\n\nGPS and satellites = strong, concrete examples.\nFinal sentence ties back to main idea → “why some people favor space exploration.”\n\nImprovements:\n\n“Like the GPS system…” → fragment (not a full sentence). Combine it smoothly:\n\n“For instance, technologies such as GPS and satellite communication—originally developed for space programs once considered wasteful—now play essential roles in daily life.”\n\nFinal linking sentence could be more formal:\n\n“Thus, expanding human knowledge not only benefits societies worldwide but also strengthens the argument for continued investment in space exploration.”\n\n\nInvesting in space exploration can generate two major benefits: economic growth and scientific advancement. Space programs stimulate commercial innovation and create spin-off technologies that drive related sectors such as aerospace and defense. Consequently, the economic returns often outweigh the initial cost. For example, space tourism has become a profitable industry, and many defense technologies originated from space research. In addition, these programs expand the frontiers of knowledge and often produce technologies that improve daily life. For instance, GPS and satellite communication - once viewed as costly experiments - now play essential roles in navigation and global connectivity. Therefore, by fostering both innovation and understanding, space exploration continues to deliver long-term benefits for humanity.\n\nNevertheless, there are several problems in nations that need to be solved before outer space programs. Unlike developed countries, many countries in the world have a low living standard, especially poor countries. These countries must face challenges like diseases, drought, and many environmental problems that need an enormous amount of resources to solve. For instance, many countries in Africa still do not have clean water supplies and basic amenities, preventing them from developing in the modern day. Furthermore, the results of space programs do not directly help basic human lives, and most of them benefit rich people. Therefore, the lives of humans on earth should be invested in before the universe."

    "text": "2 🧩 Structure Analysis (PEEL)\n\n2.1 ✅ \n\n\n2.2 Point (Topic Sentence)\n\n“Nevertheless, there are several problems in nations that need to be solved before outer space programs.”\n\nStrengths:\n\nThe word “Nevertheless” clearly signals contrast → good transition from previous paragraph.\nThe sentence directly introduces the idea: national problems should take priority over space exploration.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nSlightly awkward phrasing — “problems in nations that need to be solved before outer space programs” → unclear grammar and logic.\nYou want to express: “governments should focus on solving domestic problems before spending on space.”\n\nBetter Version:\n\n“Nevertheless, many pressing national problems must be addressed before investing in space exploration.”\n\nor\n\n“Nevertheless, governments should prioritise solving urgent domestic issues before funding outer space programs.”\n\n\n\n\n2.3 ✅ \n\n\n2.4 Explain\n\n“Unlike developed countries, many countries in the world have a low living standard, especially poor countries. These countries must face challenges like diseases, drought, and many environmental problems that need an enormous amount of resources to solve.”\n\nStrengths:\n\nLogical explanation of why poor nations should not focus on space → clear cause–effect reasoning.\nGood range of examples (disease, drought, environment).\n\nWeaknesses & Fixes:\n\nRepetition (“many countries… especially poor countries”) → redundant.\n“Have a low living standard” → use “have low living standards” (plural, and article “a” not needed).\n“Must face challenges like…” → should be “face challenges such as…” (formal tone).\n“That need an enormous amount of resources to solve” → smoother: “which require enormous resources to address.”\n\nImproved version:\n\n“Unlike developed nations, many poorer countries still have low living standards. They face serious challenges such as disease, drought, and environmental degradation, all of which require substantial resources to overcome.”\n\n\n\n\n2.5 ✅ \n\n\n2.6 Example\n\n“For instance, many countries in Africa still do not have clean water supplies and basic amenities, preventing them from developing in the modern day.”\n\nStrengths:\n\nRealistic and specific example.\nThe logic is clear and supports the argument.\n\nWeaknesses & Fixes:\n\n“Countries in Africa” → acceptable, but could be framed more diplomatically.\n“Preventing them from developing in the modern day” → awkward phrasing → “hindering their development” is smoother.\nAvoid “do not have” → “lack” is more academic.\n\nBetter version:\n\n“For example, many African nations still lack access to clean water and basic infrastructure, which continues to hinder their social and economic development.”\n\n\n\n\n2.7 ✅ \n\n\n2.8 Further Explanation\n\n“Furthermore, the results of space programs do not directly help basic human lives, and most of them benefit rich people.”\n\nStrengths:\n\nGood contrast and strong ethical argument (“benefit rich people” → clear stance).\nLogical flow with “Furthermore”.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nGrammar: “help basic human lives” → unnatural.\nClarity: “most of them benefit rich people” → “them” = unclear (programs? results?).\n\nBetter version:\n\n“Furthermore, the outcomes of space programs rarely improve basic living conditions and tend to benefit wealthier nations or individuals.”\n\n\n\n\n2.9 ✅ \n\n\n2.10 Link Sentence\n\n“Therefore, the lives of humans on earth should be invested in before the universe.”\n\nStrengths:\n\nClear conclusion; ties back to main argument.\nStrong moral appeal.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n“invested in before the universe” → ungrammatical.\nYou mean “before investing in the universe” or “before exploring the universe.”\n\nBetter version:\n\n“Therefore, governments should invest in improving life on Earth before exploring the wider universe.”\n\nNevertheless, governments should prioritize solving urgent domestic issues before funding space programs. Unlike developed nations, many poorer countries still have low living standards and face challenges such as disease, drought, and environmental degradation, all of which require substantial resources to overcome. For example, many African nations still lack access to clean water and basic infrastructure, which continues to hinder their social and economic development. Furthermore, the outcomes of space programs rarely improve basic living conditions and tend to benefit wealthier nations or individuals. Therefore, governments should invest in improving life on Earth before exploring the wider universe.\n\nIn conclusion, the benefits of space exploration can be worth the cost, but the money allocated to humans in nations is more needed. The lives of all people should be improved to a proper standard before getting the new opportunities in spaces, which are very costly.\n\n\n2.11 🔍 Sentence-by-sentence analysis\n1. “the benefits of space exploration can be worth the cost”\n✅ Good idea, but the modal “can be” weakens your stance.\n→ Better: “The benefits of space exploration may justify its cost” (more academic tone)\n→ or “While the benefits of space exploration are significant…” if you want a stronger position.\n2. “but the money allocated to humans in nations is more needed.”\n❌ “allocated to humans in nations” sounds unnatural and unclear.\nYou mean: “money spent on domestic issues” or “investment in citizens’ welfare.”\n→ Better: “but the funds are more urgently needed to address pressing domestic problems.”\n3. “The lives of all people should be improved to a proper standard before getting the new opportunities in spaces, which are very costly.”\n❌ Issues:\n\n“getting the new opportunities in spaces” → “spaces” ❌ plural and vague.\n“getting” is informal; use “pursuing” or “exploring.”\n“proper standard” → too general; use “adequate standard of living.”\n\n✅ Better: “Governments should ensure that citizens achieve an adequate standard of living before pursuing costly opportunities in outer space.”\nIn conclusion, while the benefits of space exploration may justify its cost, the funds are more urgently needed to address pressing social and economic problems on Earth. Governments should ensure that citizens achieve an adequate standard of living before pursuing ambitious and costly ventures in outer space."

    "text": "As part of our argument, we may need to give an explanation. We can do this to explain the meaning of a key term, explain the context for our ideas, or explain a complex idea in a simpler way. A question we are often asked is, ‘How do I know when I need to explain an idea?’.\nWe wrote about the topic of homelessness, and the issues surrounding this topic are generally the same in many parts of the world. However, with other topics, this is often not the case, which is why our ideas sometimes need to be explained further. For example, when writing about eating healthy, one person might make the following argument.\nIt is important to eat fruit every day, because it contains vitamins that help keep us healthy. Therefore, I completely agree with the idea that schools should encourage all children to eat fruit.\nHowever, someone with an intolerance to fruit, who gets a severe stomach ache and skin problems after eating it, may write:\nEating fruit makes people feel unwell, and it even affects their ability to work. Therefore, I completely disagree with the idea that schools should encourage all children to eat fruit.\nAnyone without the same intolerance is likely to be confused by the first statement in this argument. Again, language plays a key part: this is not a fact that is generally true for everyone, yet the use of the simple present suggests that it is. Using modal verbs (may, can, etc), as well as words and phrases like ‘sometimes’, ‘for some people’, helps to clarify ideas like this. For example:\nEating fruit can make some people feel unwell, and it can even affect their ability to work. Therefore, I completely disagree with the idea that schools should encourage all children to eat fruit.\nIn this version, the writer has presented a fact that logically supports their argument, and helps the reader understand why they hold this position.\nOur test question will sometimes do this too:\nThere are now millions of cars on the road in most big cities. Pollution from cars is the most important problem that big cities face today.\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?\nThe first sentence in this writing task presents a fact to support the argument being made in the second sentence - that this type of pollution is ‘the most important’ problem that big cities face.\n\n\nA fact is something that can be objectively measured and verified, while an argument or opinion cannot. In the test question, we know that the first sentence is a fact because we can verify it by counting the number of cars on the roads. We cannot verify the second statement because it is an opinion; we can only discuss it, and decide whether it is a valid argument or not. This is what our essay must do, which helps to explain why there is no right or wrong answer in task 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nKEY IDEA: In writing task 2, you will be presented with an argument that you must discuss and respond to, there is no right or wrong answer. The question will sometimes include a fact that supports the argument being made. You do not need to discuss this fact, but you should not ignore it - it is there to make the context for your essay clear."

    "text": "2.1 Language note\nIn academic writing, or when writing about a serious issue, we often begin by defining key terms. This can help to explain the context for the ideas in our argument. For example, if we are writing about the topic of ‘success’, we could begin by defining what this word means to us, or in our culture, which may be different to the examiner’s interpretation of the word.\nSometimes, we rephrase an idea in order to make it clearer. For example:\nMany cities have more people than houses. This means that many people do not have anywhere to live.\nIn planning, we can use equals sign (=) to represent this:\nMany cities have more people than houses = many people do not have anywhere to live.\nRephrasing the issue in this way help us to show a different way of looking at it; it changed the focus and helped to highlight how this issue affects the people involved. Other phrases that can be used like this are:\nThis means, … which means, … In other words, …\nWhenever we use these phrases, what follows should be an explanation, or a different way to interpret what we have just said. However, the verb ‘to mean’ can also be used to show a consequence or result of something, like this:\nIncreasing house prices means fewer people can afford to buy a house.\nWhen planning, we would use an arrow to show the connection between these ideas:\nIncreasing house prices -&gt; fewer people can afford to buy a house.\n\n2.1.1 Exercises\nIn the following extracts how are the phrases ‘in other words’ or ‘this means’ being used?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto explain the meaning of something\nto show a different way of looking at something\nto show the result or consequence of something\nwe cannot say because it is being used inaccurately\n\n\n\n\nIf you have a lot of money you can buy whatever you want, which means that food will never be a problem for you.\n\nok\n\nok\n\n\nIn addition, sharing the cost of education and healthcare would also prevent people from taking it for granted. This means that having to pay for the service is equivalent to being more sincere.\n\n\nok\nok\n\n\nLocal businesses might suffer as they do not have the resources to beat off competition from multinational companies, and they might be eventually put out of work. This not only means a loss of jobs, but also a loss of traditional products, which is cause for even greater concern.\n\n\nok\n\n\n\nThe possibility of finding the same shops selling the same variety of items in almost every corner of the world can be alarming. In other words, every country has its own culture with its own particular foods, which allow us to identify it from every other country.\n\nok\n\nok\n\n\n\nIn sentence 1, the writer is showing a different way of looking at the issue of having a lot of money.\nIn sentence 2, the problem may be one of vocabulary (the word ‘sincere’ is inaccurate here) but this is not an explanation of the previous sentence.\nIn sentence 3, the writer is showing two results or consequences of what happens when local businesses close.\nIn sentence 4, the second sentence is providing a reason for the previous sentence, so ‘This is because’ would be more accurate"

    "text": "The need to explain movement and physical changes.\nORganize the infor step by step to explain how somethings is done or how st develops.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe word ‘fish’ is generally used as an uncountable noun (the plural ‘fishes’ is only used rarely to refer to different fish species). This includes different types of fish such as tuna, salmon, etc. So we can say ‘the tuna swim’, not “the tunas swim”\nWe can use the word to mean one fish: the salmon swims or several fish: the salmon swim.\nNB Whales and dolphins are mammals and are countable nouns.\n\n\n\n\nWe may need to describe:\ntime, different stages, physical changes, movement\n\n\n\noften saying how long a stage or step in a process takes or lasts, or how much time is spent in a place.\n\nThis stage lasts for four years.\nThe fry spend four years in the upper river.\nIt took five years to complete the renovations.\n\nWith our current task, we cannot say: ‘The salmon eggs take 5-6 months to break out of their eggs’, because we do not know how long this specific process takes and it is unlikely to take up 6 months for the fish to break out of their eggs.\nPhase, period, stage, and time are useful synonyms to use here, but be careful with the prepositions at and during. Phase and time can refer to either a length of time or point of time, and so we can use both during and at with these:\n\nDuring this phase NOT at this phase\nDuring this period NOT at this period\nDuring this stage, at this stage\nDuring this time, at this time\n\n\n\n\nWe can use the following verbs to describe the physical changes that occur in a natural process:\nBecome, change, develop, grow, turn into\nThey are used slightly differently\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribing physical change\n\n\n\nBecome is often used with a comparative e.g. ‘become bigger’, or to describe a change: e.g. ‘the smolt becomes an adult salmon’.\nChange has a broader meaning and can be used to introduce the idea: e.g. ‘the fish then changes again and becomes …’, or ‘the fish then changes again, growing bigger …’ It can also be used with ‘into’ e.g. ‘the fry changes into a smolt’ NB not changes to a smolt.\nDevelop and grow can be used with a specific feature: e.g. ‘the egg hatches and the young fish develops / grows fins and a tail’. Or to describe a change: e.g. ‘the smolt develops into / grows into an adult salmon.’\nTurn into is a phrasal verb and is similar in meaning to ‘change into’ or ‘become’ e.g. ‘the fry turn into a smolt’\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can’t use the verb evolve to describe this type of natural change.\nSimilarly, be careful with the verb transform, which suggests a change into something completely new. For example, a ceterpillar transforms into a butterfly or Following the renovation, the old shed was transformed into a modern restaurant.\nMake sure any adjectives or adverbs we use accurately describe what we are shown in the images. Can you see any problems in the following extracts?\nThe fish grow enormously in size during the final stage.\nThe huge salmon returns …\nThe fry migrate downstream to a highly turbulent water\nAt the end of this period, it turns into gigantic ‘adult salmon’\nThe fully developed salmon now have unique color patterns on their back…\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nMake sure the language we use accurately describes the images in the diagram. Pay particular attention to any adjectives and adverbs we use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose the verbs into correct box.\nremain, stay, flow, develop into, spend, grow into, take, last, move, travel, migrate, continue, change, become, leave, transform, turn into\n\n\n\nTime\nMovement or lack of movement\nPhysical changes\n\n\n\n\n\nstay\ndevelop into\n\n\nspend\nflow\ngrow into\n\n\ntake\nmove\nchange\n\n\nlast\ntravel\nbecome\n\n\ncontinue\nmigrate\ntransform\n\n\n\nleave\nturn into\n\n\n\nremain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the verbs in ex 1 can (or must) be used together with an adverb or preposition.\nChoose from the following words:\nalong, at, away from, for, in, into, to, towards\n\n\n\nTo last for\n\n\nTo continue for\n\n\nTo stay away from\n\n\nTo flow along / away from / to / towards\n\n\nTo remain in/ at\n\n\nTo grow into\n\n\nTo develop into\n\n\nTo turn into\n\n\nTo change into\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis stage lasts to for six month.\nThe young fish moves away at from the upper river.\nThe fry changes to into a smolt.\nThe fry spend for towards at least five months here.\nThe smolt develops in into an adult salmon.\nThe stage continues in for five to six months.\nThe fry travels into to / towards the lower river.\nIn the open sea, the smolt develops to into an adult salmon.\nAt During this phase, the fish grows much bigger.\nDuring At this stage, the fish is only a few centimeters long.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fish grow enormously in size during the final stage.\nThe huge salmon returns …\nThe fry migrate downstream to a highly turbulent water.\nAt the end of this period, it turns into gigantic ‘adult salmon’\nThe fully developed salmon now have unique color patterns on their back …\n\nIn sentence 1 - 4, the adverbs or adjectives are too strong. Suggestions:\n\nThe fish grow significantly during the final stage.\nThe large fish returns … OR The adult salmon returns … OR The fully grown salmon returns…\nThe fry migrate downstream to the faster running water.\nAt the end of this period, in turns into a large / fully grown ‘adult salmon’\n\nIn sentence 5, we do not know if these patterns are ‘unique’ (other fish may have them and the diagram does not tell us this information) ‘characteristic’ or ‘distinctive’ are good words to use here:\n\nThe fully developed salmon now have distinctive color patterns on their back …\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn process tasks we are more likely to be using small numbers. The general convention when writing numbers is to use the word form for the numbers one to ten and the numerals for numbers above ten. However, this is not a very important point to remember for the test.\nOur writing task gives the following information about the size of the salmon in different stages of its like:\n\nThis give us a minimum and maximum length measured in centimeters. We can use the abbreviation ‘cm’ as shown in the image, but using the full word gives a better impression of our writing ability. There are two possible spellings: centimetres and centimeters. Try to be consistent in our spelling. We should often check for a mixture of cm, centimeters, centimetres.\nThere are several ways to describe the range of sizes above. Look at the following examples (notice the words in blue)\n\nThe fry is between three and eight centimeters long.\n*The fry grows to between three and eight centimeters.\nThe fry can grow to between three and eight centimeters in length.\nThe fry can reach up to eight centimeters in length.\n\n* We can also say: The fry grows to between three and eight centimeters in length.\nCan you correct the errors in the following sentences? Think about the type of relative clause you need to use to add extra information.\n\nThe salmon eggs take approximately 5-6 months to break out of their eggs and develop into baby salmons called ‘fry’, with only 3-8 cm in length. which are …\nThe little salmon can grow to more than three centimeters, less than eight in length. -&gt; grow to between 3 and 8 centimeters in length.\nFry evolve into smolt that is 12-15 centimeters. -&gt; Fry develop into smolt that is 12-15 centimeters in length.\n\nSuggested corections:\n\nThe salmon eggs take approximately 5-6 months to break out of their eggs and develop into baby salmon called ‘fry’, which are only 3-8 cm in length. (NB I used a non-defining relative clause to add the extra information about the length of the fry.)\nThe little salmon can grow to between three and eight centimeters in length.\nFry develop into / change into / turn into smolt, which are 12-15 centimeters in length / long. (Again, I need to use a non-defining relative clause here - notice the comma before which)"

Overall, the cycle takes almost ten years and comprises three main stages, each of which takes place in a different aquatic environment.\nThe salmon begins life as an egg. In the slow-moving waters of the upper river, sheltered by reeds and small stones. Over a period of five to six months, the eggs hatch into very small fish known as ‘fry’, which can grow up to eight centimeters in length. The fry then move to the faster flowing water of the lower river, where they remain for a period of four years and continue to grow. During this phase, they can double or triple in size, reaching 12 to 15 centimeters, and are now referred to as ‘smolt’.\nAt the end of this stage, the smolt leave the river for the open sea, where they will spend the next five years of their life. It is in this salt-water environment that the fish develops its characteristic shape and coloring and reaches its full length of 70 to 76 centimeters, almost ten times its original size. Finally, the adult salmon will return to the slow-moving river to lay its eggs, and the cycle will begin again."

I also varied between the plural (the fry move, the smolt leave) and singular (the fish develops). However, these variations are grouped together logically (i.e. I did not change backwards and forwards between the different tense or between singular and plural).\nIn terms of organization, I decided to write about stages one and two in the first paragraph, and then stages three and one (return to the beginning) in the second paragraph.\nMy answer is 208 words. There is no ideal length and each task will be different. However, you should aim to write between 160 and 220 words.

The lifecycle of the salmon has 3 main stages and takes place in 3 different locations.\nThe cycle begins when salmon eggs are laid among the reeds and the small stones of the upper river.

    "text": "In the past, knowledge was contained in books. Nowadays, knowledge is uploaded to the internet. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?\nIt is a fact of modern life that most information today is store online, rather than in physical books as it was in the past. In my opinion, this is a negative despite its obvious conveniences.\nSupporters of this trend can point to the numerous ways knowledge kept online can be disseminated and used. Online information is almost universally accessible, narrowing socioeconomic differences in society and allowing for various conveniences. First of all, users can find relevant information on search engines from a wide range of sources including user-generated sites like Wikipedia to news outlets like The New York Times and academic journals as well. Once an individual locates the information they are looking for, it is also easier to search within that article, share it with others, have it wherever they go and store more than would be possible if it were a hard copy.\nNonetheless, storing information online encourages a dependence on computer technology that is harmful for the human mind. In the past, if a person wanted to research a given topic, they would have to check out a library book or talk with an expert. This process was much slower and open to the possibility of bias. However, it also meant that individuals were more conscientious and patiently learned from fuller, more nuanced sources. Nowadays, most people read short articles, hastily written to attract more clicks and generate advertising revenue. These tap into a fundamental human need to be constantly engaged and feeling pleasure. Over time, this has led to a generation addicted to devices, lacking the healthy habits engendered by careful research and study.\nIn conclusion, despite the handiness of online information, the impact on the human psyche makes this a negative trend on level. Individuals must themselves find ways to counter these potentially injurious effects.\nSample positive essay:\nIn the digital age, the migration of knowledge from physical books to online platforms has become a defining feature of global society. While critics argue that this shift undermines intellectual depth and fosters dependency, I firmly believe the advantages of accessible, dynamic, and. collaborative information far surpass its drawbacks.\nProponent of online knowledge store emphasize its unparalleled capacity to democratize information. Unlike traditional books, which are more constrained by physical availability and cost, digital platforms grant instantaneous access to vast repositories of data for anyone with an internet connection. Students in remote villages, for instance, can now access lectures from Ivy League universities, download academic journals, or participate in global forums - opportunities once reserved for the socioeconomically privileged. Moreover, search engines and algorithms allow users to pinpoint precise information within seconds, a task that previously required hours of library search. The integration of multimedia - such as video, interactive graphs, and hyperlinks- further enriches understanding, catering to diverse learning styles. Crucially, digital storage eliminates the environmental toll of paper production, reducing deforestation and carbon emissions linked to printing and distributing physical books.\nDetractors, however, contend that the internet fosters misinformation, distraction, and superficial engagement. While valid, these concern are not insurmountable. It is true that unverified content proliferates online, yet this issue is counterbalanced by the rise of fact-checking tools, peer-reviewed databases, and digital literacy programs that empower users to discern credible sources. Similarly, although the constant influx of notifications and bite-sized content risks fragmenting attentions spans, individuals and educators can cultivate disciplined usage through structured learning frameworks and mindfulness practices. The digital divide-limited internet access in impoverished regions - remains a challenge, yet global initiatives to expand connectivity, such as satellite internet projects and affordable mobile data, are steadily bridging this gap.\nIn conclusion, the transition to online knowledge storage represents a net positive for humanity. Its capacity to democratize education, enhance efficiency, and promote sustainability far outweighs manageable risks like misinformation and distraction. To maximize benefits, society must prioritize digital literacy and equitable access, ensuring the internet remains a force for collective progress.\n\nSpeaking\n\nHow often do most people use the internet? Most people use the internet daily, if not constantly. Smartphones and Wi-Fi have made it ubiquitous whether for work, social media, or streaming. For instance, younger generations might spend 6+ hours online, while older adults might use it less frequently but still rely on it for news or banking.\nAre there drawbacks to its overuse? Absolutely. Overuse can lead to addiction, reduced productivity, and mental issues like anxiety or loneliness. Physically, screen time strains eyes and disrupts sleep. Socially, it erodes face-to-face interactions - think of families ignoring each other to scroll through phones. Moderation is key.\nWhat kind of information can people find online? Virtually anything. From academic research on Google Scholar to DIY tutorials on Youtube, and even niche forums discussing obscure hobbies. However, misinformation is rampant too - fake news, biased articles, or conspiracy theories. Critical thinking is essential to navigate this flood of data.\nHow was this changed the way people get their information? It’s deepen integration into daily life. Think smart homes controlled via apps, AI-driven healthcare consultations, or virtual reality workspaces. However, privacy concerns will grow, and the digital divide may widen unless access becomes universal. Education and jobs will increasingly depend on digital literacy."

From the front and side view, Tool A had an oval shape, rough surface and blunt edges, hence presumably the inferior version compared to Tool B.\nAfter 0.6 million years, the tool was upgraded into a spear-shaped instrument with the tip and edges being much sharper. While tool B was 10 centimeters long - the same length as Tool A, the surface of Tool B was crafted to be smoother and the overall width to be larger. Therefore, these features rendered this version more superior in terms of cutting effeciency."

Overall, the number of migrant workers in New Zealand and the United States increased mildly in the 3-year period, while the other two countries experienced a steady rise in migrant workers.\nNew Zealand had the fewest migrant workers in both 2003 and 2006, ending the period at 87,000 people, but they have the most crowded in 2006 proportion with 21.1 per 1000 people. On the contrary, migrant workers of the United States were the largest in number, with 577,000 in 2003, and rose to 678,000 in 2006. Besides that, the rate of them was still the lowest in 4 countries, with just 2.3 per 1000 people.\nThe second largest number of migrant workers in 2003 was in Australia, with 152,000, and it increased sharply to 219,000 in 2006. While the United Kingdom began the period with 137,000 in 2003, it had nearly doubled by 2006 to 266,000 people, surpassing Australia, but the rate of the UK was just nearly half of Australia, respectively 4.4 and 10.7 per 1000 people in 2006.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriterion\nBand\nFeedback\n\n\n\n\nTask Achievement\n8.0\nYou clearly describe key trends, make comparisons, and cover all data.

Issues: article use (“the number and the proportion”), tense agreement (“have the most crowded”), and comparative phrasing. Minor errors but meaning is always clear.\n\n\n\nRevised:\nThe table illustrates the number and proportion of temporary migrant workers in four countries - New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Australia, and the United States - between 2003 and 2006. Overall, all four nations experienced growth in their temporary migrant workers, although the scale of increase varied. While the United States consistently had the largest number of migrant workers, New Zealand recorded the highest proportion relative to its population.\nIn 2003, the United States employed the greatest number of temporary migrants, at 577,000, rising to 678,000 by 2006. Despite this, its proportion remained the lowest among the four, at only 2.3 per 1,000 people. In contrast, New Zealand had the smallest number of such workers, just 64,000 in 2003 and 87,000 in three year laters, but its rate was the highest, reaching 21.1 per 1,000 people in 2006.\nAustralia and the United Kingdom both saw notable growth. Australia’s figures climbed from 152,000 to 219,000, while the UK nearly doubled its total, from 137,000 to 266,000. However, by 2006, the rate of temporary workers in the UK remained roughly half that of Australia, at 4.4 and 10.7 per 1,000 people respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour phrase\nBetter academic alternative\n\n\n\n\n“have the most crowded in 2006 proportion”\n“recorded the highest proportion in 2006”\n\n\n“rate of them was still the lowest”\n“its rate remained the lowest”\n\n\n“respectivelyely”\n“respectively”\n\n\n“on the contrary”\n“in contrast” or “by contrast”\n\n\n“besides that”\n“meanwhile” or “additionally”\n\n\n\nuse such workers to reference (and not repetitive)\n\nmigrant workers → such workers → these workers → this figure → this number → the proportion → this rate → these data"

It may require a change in attitude, and to see taking time out from the pressures of work as healthy rather than a sign of laziness or weakness.

Nevertheless, these solutions will take time and, for those who cannot reduce their working hours, are likely to be ineffective. Seemingly, when it comes to solving complex health problems, there is no simple solution.\nModel answer\nPublic health is a growing concern, with many countries reporting increasing levels of obesity. Some believe the problem can be addressed by adding more sports facilities, while others think this may not be enough. A closer look at the problem will help in assessing these views.\nAdding sports facilities would certainly be an attractive idea to some.

Seemingly, when it comes to solving complex health problems, there is no simple solution.\nIn conclusion, in my view, giving people who are time-poor greater access to sports facilities will not be effective and is too simplistic a solution. Other measures are clearly required, but any action taken to improve public health requires a change in lifestyle, and this needs the cooperation of everyone involved.\n\n1 A Positive or a negative development\nOur diet is becoming increasingly unhealthy. This is reflected in the fact that cheap, fast food, and sugary drinks are now found in many shops around the world. However, the low prices and convenience come at a cost.\nUndoubtedly, the easy access to prepared meals and canned drinks has some advantages. Firstly, this type of food is abundant because it appeals to our taste buds. People would not eat it so often if they did not enjoy it. The low cost also means that people on a lower income can afford to feed their families, and it is made even more appealing because it also saves time in the kitchen. There are also now so many big businesses based on producing this type of food and drink that many workers are dependent on the selling or making of it, and this industry is a key employer of many lower income families. These advantages show that this development is likely to continue for some time.\nNevertheless, the negative effects are significant. The low cost of fast food means that it has become more of a staple diet for many people. It is widely acknowledge that processed and sugary foods are unhealthy, so their widespread consumption is concerning. Such food contains many additives, offer little nutrition, and is largely seen as responsible for the growing obesity problems around the world. In addition, there are links to diabetes, all of which affects the economy as well as putting pressure on the healthcare system. Ultimately, the problem associated with this type of food have an impact on everyone.\nIn conclusion, the availability, convenience, and appeal of this type of food means that it is likely to be here to stay. Nevertheless, the long-term health effects show that, on the whole, this is a negative development. Finding a way to increase the cost would go some way to solving this.\nstaple diet = the main food/s eaten by a person or in a country\nadditives = chemicals added to food and drink (often to preserve or to add taste)"

    "text": "7.1 Topic: Birth Order & Family Personality\n\n7.1.1 Do you come from a large or small family?\nI come from a small family - it’s just me and my younger sibling. Since there are only two of us, we’ve always been quite close, although of course we had our share of sibling rivalry growing up.\n\n\n7.1.2 Are you the oldest, youngest or a middle child ?\nI’m the oldest child, and that often came with extra responsibilities. For example, I was expected to set a good example and sometimes even help take care of my younger sibling. That definitely influenced how I developed certain traits like being more disciplined and organized.\n\n\n7.1.3 Do you think your personality has been affected by your birth order?\nYes, I think so. As the eldest, I felt a certain pressure to be mature and dependable. I’ve always bene quite dominant in group settings, and I think that’s partly because I got used to being in charge at home. At the same time, I believe it made me more protective and nurturing as an older brother,.\nPart 2: Cue Card Sample Answer (Oldest Child, One Sibling)\nDescribe how your position in the family may have influenced your personality.\nYou should say:\nWhat your position in the family is\nWhat traits are associated with this position\nWhether you agree with them\nAnd explain how this may have affected your relationships\nSample Answer:\nI’m the oldest of two children — I have a younger sibling. In many families, the eldest child is expected to be responsible, organised, and a bit more mature than the others. I’d say those traits do describe me fairly well. From an early age, I felt a sense of responsibility, especially when it came to setting an example or helping out around the house.\nOne stereotype about eldest children is that they tend to be dominant or even bossy. While I try not to be overbearing, I do like being in control of situations, especially in group work or decision-making. So in that sense, I guess the stereotype fits a little.\nBeing the older sibling has definitely influenced my relationships, both within and outside the family. With my sibling, I’ve often taken on a protective role — sometimes maybe too much. In friendships, I tend to be quite dependable and often take initiative, perhaps because I’m used to leading.\nOverall, I believe that being the oldest has shaped my confidence and helped me develop strong interpersonal skills. It has its challenges, but it’s also given me a sense of purpose and direction.\n\nDo you think birth order really influences a person’s personality?\n\nSample Answer:\nTo some extent, yes. There’s empirical evidence suggesting that the eldest child tends to be more dominant and responsible, while the youngest might be more attention-seeking. However, I think environment and parenting styles are also major factors, so it’s not entirely about birth order.\n\nWhy do some people reject these birth order theories?\n\nSample Answer:\nSome argue that these theories are based on stereotypes rather than consistent data. In fact, people often don’t fit neatly into these categories. For instance, an only child might be seen as self-centred, but that doesn’t apply to everyone. Personality is shaped by many variables, not just the order in which someone is born.\n\nHow can sibling rivalry impact a child’s development?\n\nSample Answer:\nSibling rivalry can have both negative and positive effects. On the downside, it may lead to long-term resentment if not managed properly. But on the upside, it can help children learn to stand up for themselves, negotiate, and even verbalise their feelings more effectively.\n\nAre families today different in how they affect personality compared to the past?\n\nSample Answer:\nDefinitely. Modern families tend to be smaller, and parenting is more focused on emotional well-being. In the past, eldest children often had to take on more responsibility, especially in large families. Now, the distribution of roles is more balanced, which may lead to less rigid personality traits based on birth order."

I had read the play before, but watching it live was very different. The set was really impressive and probably the most memorable part. The lighting helped create the mood in many scenes, although some parts were quite dark and hard to see. The costumes were modern, which I didn’t expect, but I think it worked. I liked the music at the start, but later it didn’t have much effect. One thing I didn’t like was that some actors spoke too fast or quietly, so I couldn’t always understand them.

Family problems, love, and conflicts are things everyone can understand, even now.\n\nHow important is the director in a play?\n\nThe director is very important. They decide how the actors move, how the stage looks, and how the play is shown to the audience. This can make a big difference to how much people enjoy it.\n\nWhat makes a performance memorable?\n\nGood acting, interesting sets, and music can make it memorable. Also, if the audience can feel the emotions of the characters, it is more likely to stay in their minds.\n\nDoes watching a play in another language change the experience?\n\nYes, it can be harder to understand, but watching the actors and their expressions helps. Sometimes, the feelings come through even if you don’t understand every word.\n\nWhy are Shakespeare’s plays famous around the world?\n\nThey can be interpreted in many ways. Directors can change the time or place of the story, and the characters are complex, so people everywhere can relate to them."

I had read the play before, but seeing it performed live was a completely different experience. The set design was visually stunning and probably the most memorable aspect of the performance. The lighting created the right atmosphere for different scenes, though some moments were a bit dim and hard to follow. The costumes were contemporary, which surprised me initially, but ultimately I thought it worked well and added a fresh perspective. The music at the start was brilliant, though it didn’t have much impact later in Acts 2 and 3, which was a little disappointing. One aspect that I think could have been improved was the actors’ delivery of lines. Some spoke too quickly, while others weren’t loud enough, which made it difficult to catch every word. Overall, the performance had a powerful emotional effect on me, particularly the ending, which intensified the drama. I found it a very engaging and thought-provoking experience, and it reminded me why Shakespeare’s works remain so relevant today.\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Part 3 – Discussion (4–5 minutes)\nTopic: Theatre, Culture, and Literature\n\nWhy do you think classic plays like Romeo and Juliet are still performed today?\n\nI think it’s because the themes are universal and timeless. Issues such as family tension, love, and conflict are still very relatable. Even though society has changed a lot since Shakespeare’s time, these basic human experiences remain relevant.\n\nHow important is the role of the director in a theatre production?\n\nThe director plays a crucial role in interpreting the text and deciding how to use the theatre space, lighting, and music to create the desired emotional impact. A skilled director can make a familiar story feel fresh and engaging.\n\nWhat makes a performance memorable for the audience?\n\nA combination of factors: compelling acting, imaginative set and costume design, and an emotional connection. If the audience can relate to the characters or feel the tension and drama, it leaves a lasting impression.\n\nDo you think watching plays in translation affects your understanding?\n\nIt can initially be challenging, but expressions, gestures, and acting often convey the meaning effectively. I found that focusing on non-verbal cues helped me appreciate the performance even if I didn’t understand every word.\n\nWhy are Shakespeare’s plays so popular internationally?\n\nThey’re versatile and can be interpreted in many ways. Directors can experiment with different settings, costumes, or time periods while keeping the story’s essence intact. Also, the characters are complex, which allows audiences across cultures to connect with them."

Excellent concentration.\nWhat to Learn: Trap signals like “first… then… actually”. Review singular/plural in daily items.\n\n\n\n\n2.0.2 ⚠️ Recording 2 – Agriculture & Horticulture Jobs\n\nMistakes: Q14, Q17, Q19, Q20.\nProblem Areas:\n\nMisinterpreted disadvantages vs requirements.\nConfused training vs experience.\nDidn’t catch contrast phrases clearly.\n\nTheme to Study: Employment vocabulary (contract, promotion, training course, accommodation, overtime).\nKey Learning: Watch for “not… but…” / “instead of…” signals.\n\n\n\n\n2.0.3 ⚠️ Recording 3 – Calories & Nutrition\n\nMistakes (you told me earlier): Q11, Q12, Q16, Q27.\nProblem Areas:\n\nMisheard numbers/details about calorie calculations.\nDistracted by fast speech and lost focus on key data.\n\nTheme to Study: Food, health, measurements (calorie, portion, intake, nutrients, balanced diet).\nKey Learning: Practice listening for numbers + units carefully (kcal, grams, percentages).\n\n\n\n\n2.0.4 ⚠️ Recording 4 – Hand Knitting\n\nMistakes: Q33 (equipment not equipments), Q40 (sheep not sheeps).\nProblem Areas: Grammar slips with uncountable nouns and irregular plurals.\nTheme to Study: History & crafts (garment, yarn, wool, technique, tradition).\nKey Learning: Revise common uncountable nouns + irregular plurals list.\n\n\n\n\n\n3 📌 Overall Pattern Today\n\nStrengths: You can follow lectures and everyday dialogues well.

It smells so much nicer than coal…”\nWhy not “woods”?\n\n“Wood” in English is uncountable when referring to the material used for burning.\n“Woods” (plural) usually refers to a forest or a collection of trees, not the material for a fire.\n\nTip to know:\n\nListen for “all the wood” — singular/uncountable is correct here.\nKey phrases: “all the … you need” or “some …” → usually uncountable nouns.\n\n\n\nOther notes on your mistakes:\nQ3: You wrote CHIRVIL, correct spelling: CHERVIL\n\nShirley spells it: “Chervil.

If the speaker mentions “we considered X but decided Y,” you must pick Y, the final location.\n\n\n✅ Summary of the error pattern:\n\nYou chose either planned/considered location instead of final location, or misread directional cues.\nAlways mark final decisions and track positional words: near, beyond, east, southeast, etc.\n\n\n\n\n7 Recording 3\n\n7.0.1 Q25: Amsterdam\n\nYou answered: E (well designed)\nCorrect answer: C (surprised it has been so successful)\nRecording clue:\n\nAmy: “In a way it’s strange that there was such a demand for bike-sharing because you’d have thought most people would have used their own bikes.”\n\nWhy C?\n\nBoth speakers express surprise that Amsterdam’s scheme is so well used given the strong cycling culture.\n“Well designed” is not mentioned; the key is unexpected success.\n\nTip: Focus on adjectives that show emotion or surprise.\n\n\n\n\n7.0.2 Q27: London\n\nYou answered: G (expanded too quickly)\nCorrect answer: D (more investment is required)\nRecording clue:\n\nJake: “Basically, not enough’s been spent on increasing the number of cycle lanes. Hopefully that’ll change.”\n\nWhy D?\n\nThe problem is underinvestment, not rapid expansion.\n“Expanded too quickly” is the opposite of what was said.\n\nTip: Look for words like not enough / insufficient / lacking, which often indicate the correct answer.\n\n\n\n\n7.0.3 Q28: Buenos Aires\n\nYou answered: D (more investment required)\nCorrect answer: E (system well designed)\nRecording clue:\n\nAmy: “Mmm. They built a huge network of cycle lanes to support the introduction of the scheme … An example of good planning.”\n\nWhy E?\n\n“Good planning” implies the scheme is well designed, not that more investment is needed.\n\nTip: Words like good planning, successful introduction point to well-designed system.\n\n\n\n\n7.0.4 Q30: Sydney\n\nYou answered: C (expanded too quickly)\nCorrect answer: A (disappointing)\nRecording clue:\n\nJake: “I can’t quite work out why it hasn’t been an instant success like some of the others. It’s a shame really.”\n\nWhy A?\n\nThe speakers are disappointed because Sydney’s scheme hasn’t grown quickly.\n“Expanded too quickly” is clearly incorrect, the opposite problem.\n\nTip: Listen for phrases like “it’s a shame / disappointing / not as expected” — these indicate disappointment.\n\n\n✅ Summary of error pattern:\n\nConfused emotions/opinions (surprised vs. well designed, disappointing vs. too fast).\nMisinterpreted investment vs. expansion.\nNeed to pay attention to phrases that indicate judgment: “strange,” “it’s a shame,” “hopefully that’ll change.”\n\n\n\n\n8 Recording 4\n\n8.0.1 Q31: Portuguese ships transporting …\n\nYou wrote: SPICIES\nCorrect answer: SPICE(S)\nWhy?\n\nIn the recording, it says: “The sailors were carrying spices back to Europe…”\nThe word is uncountable in general form but plural “spices” is also acceptable, depending on IELTS transcript.\nYou added an extra “i” → spelling mistake.\n\nTip: For listening, always double-check spelling of commonly confused words. In IELTS, singular vs plural is important only if explicitly indicated. Here spice(s) is accepted.\n\n\n\n\n8.0.2 Q40: The arrival of farming meant the … was destroyed\n\nYou wrote: FORESTS\nCorrect answer: FOREST\nWhy?\n\nRecording: “This meant that the forest that has once covered all the island… was cut down…”\nEven though there were multiple forested areas, the text refers to the forest as one entity covering the island, so singular is correct.\n\nTip: Look for “the” + noun in the recording; singular form is usually required.\n\n\n✅ Key takeaways:\n\nPlural vs singular: Listen carefully for “the” — often signals singular.\nSpelling: Watch for small errors in familiar words like spice(s).\nIELTS Listening is strict: one-word answers must match the recording exactly."

The data is divided into six different age groups.\nOverall, women were more active than men in most age groups, except for the youngest group. The biggest difference between genders can be seen in people aged 25 to 34, while the activity levels for older people were more similar.\nIn the 15 to 24 age group, men were slightly more active than women, with 52.8% of males doing regular physical activity compared to 47.7% of females. This was the only age group where men were more active than women, indicating a reversal of the general trend observed in the other age groups.\nFrom age 25 onwards, female participation in physical activity consistent exceeded that of males. Among those aged 35 to 44,\nIn the oldest group, aged 65 and over, the figures were almost the same: 46.7% for men and 47.1% for women.

It’s located in the northern part of the city and is widely regarded as one of the most ethical and well-designed zoos in the world.\nWhat impressed me most was the open-concept layout. Instead of case, many animals live in naturalistic habitats separated from visitors by moats or hidden barriers. I was able to observe orangutans swinging freely in trees above the walkways and giraffes roaming spacious enclosures.\nThere were also interactive sessions, such as feeding times and educational talks by zookeepers, where I learned a lot about endangered species and conservation efforts. The zoo also partners with various wildlife protection organizations and supports breeding programs for rare species.\nI felt genuinely inspired by the experience. It made me realize that when zoos are operated responsibly, they can help preserve biodiversity and raise public awareness about the threats facing wildlife today. I felt the zoo feeling hopeful and more committed to supporting conservation causes."

    "text": "Part 3\n\nQ1: Do you think zoos are necessary in today’s world?\nYes, I believe they are still necessary, but only under strict ethical and scientific standards. With habitat destruction accelerating and many species on the brink of extinction, zoos can serve as safe havens for breeding and research. That said, zoos that exist solely for entertainment, with poor living conditions, should be phased out.\n\n\nQ2: How can zoos educate the public?\nZoos have a unique ability to engage people emotionally by allowing close encounters with animals they would never see in the wild. Interactive exhibits, live demonstrations, and conservation talks can make complex environmental issues accessible and compelling, especially for children.\n\n\nQ3: What alternatives to zoos do you think could replace their role in education and conservation?\nWildlife sanctuaries and virtual reality experiences might be viable alternatives. Sanctuaries allow animals to live in more natural settings, while technology can simulate immersive encounters without keeping animals in captivity. However, these solutions aren’t always scalable or practical for endangered species preservation, so ethical zoos still have a role to play. # Gre essay\n\nThe director of a local zoo has claimed that the zoo must expand its exotic animal exhibit to attract more visitors. He cites a recent survey showing that 85% of new zoo visitors came specifically to see exotic animals. Based on this, he concludes that investing in new exotic species will increase overall ticket sales and boost the zoo’s revenue."

    "section": "Sample GRE Argument essay",
    "text": "Sample GRE Argument essay\nThe argument that expanding the exotic animal exhibit will increase zoo revenue is unconvincing, as it rests on several questionable assumptions and lacks sufficient supporting evidence. Without addressing these issues, the zoo may risk investing in an initiative that fails to produce the expected benefits.\nFirst, the argument assumes a direct causal relationship between exotic animals and increased attendance. While the director cites a survey indicating that 85% of new visitors came specifically to see exotic species, this data may be misleading. The survey does not clarify whether these visitors would have attended the zoo regardless of the exhibit, nor does it prove that exotic animals were the primary motivator. Other factors such as promotions, seasonal events, or group tours may have influenced their visit. Without clear evidence of causation, the conclusion remains speculative.\nSecondly, the reliability of the survey itself is questionable. The argument does not provide information about the sample size, methodology, or representativeness of the surveyed visitors. For instance, if the survey was conducted only during a temporary exotic animal showcase, the data may not reflect general visitor preferences. Additionally, focusing solely on new visitors ignores the preferences of returning guests, who may value other aspects of the zoo such as local wildlife, interactive experiences, or conservation programs.\nFurthermore, the argument overlooks potential downsides and costs associated with expanding the exhibit. Exotic animals often require specialized care, habitats, and veterinary expertise, which can significantly increase operating expenses. If the new exhibit fails to attract sufficient new visitors or if existing patrons are alienated by the change, the zoo might face financial losses rather than gains. A cost-benefit analysis would be necessary to determine whether the investment is justified.\nIn conclusion, the argument makes a hasty recommendation based on incomplete and possibly flawed evidence. To strengthen the case, the director should conduct more comprehensive research, including long-term visitor trends, preferences of different demographics, and a detailed financial projection. Only then can the zoo make an informed decision about expanding its exotic animal exhibit."

    "text": "4.1 Part 1: Introduction & Interview\n\n4.1.1 Topic: Leisure & Free Time (linked to boredom & stimulation)\n\nQ1. What do you like to do in your free time?\nIn my spare time, I usually try to disconnect from digital distractions and engage in more meaningful activities, like journaling or reading. I’ve notice that when I’m bored, instead of resorting to overstimulation like social media, I try to embrace the boredom-it’s surprisingly stimulating and often sparks creative ideas.\n\n\nQ2. Do you often feel bored?\nYes, I do from time to time. But I’ve learned that boredom, especially what psychologists call indifferent boredom, can be a gateway to creativity. Rather than seeing it as a negative state, I treat it as a signal that I need to re-engage with something mentally rewarding.\n\n\nQ3. What kind of things make people bored easily these days ?\nHonestly, I think it’s our over-connected lifestyle. There’s so much passive consumption -videos, scrolling, noise - that it paradoxically leads to a lack of meaningful engagement. When activities feel purposeless or repetitive, people fall into a state of apathy of reactant boredom, which is quite destructive.\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Topic: EDUCATION & LEARNING\n\nQ1. What subject did you enjoy most at school?\nI really enjoyed literature mathematics because it allowed me to express my thoughts creatively. I found that when the class was engaging, I was less likely to feel bored or distracted. It’s like what researchers say-when we feel meaningfully involved, boredom is less likely to set in.\n\n\nQ2. What kind of teacher do you prefer?\nI prefer teachers who can make the subject come alive. Someone who sparks curiosity and encourages active learning rather than passive memorization. I think the worst thing is when a class becomes repetitive-it leads to apathy and disengagement.\n\n\nQ3. Do you prefer studying alone or with others?\nThat depends. For deep reading or writing, I prefer to study alone so I can concentrate. But for brainstorming or practicing speaking skills, studying with others can make the experience more dynamic and stimulating."

I began doing it during university, especially during those quiet moments of indifferent boredom when I felt mentally under-stimulated. Strangely, boredom sparked my imagination, letting my mind wander freely. I believe creativity often flourishes in those conditions. Writing allows me to explore ideas and emotions I can’t always express verbally. Sometimes I think of it like programming imagination into words, similar to how artificial intelligence tools like the Painting Fool are programmed to generate art. But unlike machines, my creativity stems from real emotional experiences. That personal input makes it fulfilling and cathartic.\nCue Card: Describe an educational experience that was especially important for you.\n\nYou should say:\n\nWhat it was\nWhen it happened\nWhat you learned from it\nAnd explain why it was important to you\n\n\nOne of the most memorable educational experiences I’ve had was attending a creativity workshop during high school. It was organized to help students break away from rigid academic routines and think outside the box. We weren’t given clear instructions- instead, we had to solve a real-world problem in teams. Initially, some of us felt a bit of ‘calibrating boredom’, unsure of what to do, but that actually pushed us to explore ideas more creatively. That session taught me that boredom isn’t necessarily negative- it can push us to innovate when we’re given freedom."

As one researcher put it, computer-generated art often lacks an irresistible essence because we know it wasn’t born out of genuine human experience or emotion.\n\n\nQ2. Why do some people dislike art made by machines?\nI think it’s partly due to prejudice and partly because people value the effort and thought behind a piece. Studies show that when people think a human created the art, they perceive it as more meaningful. When the same art is labeled as machine-generated, the emotional connection is undermined.\n\n\nQ3. How important is creativity in education and work?\nExtremely important. In education, fostering creativity helps students move beyond memorization and into real problem-solving. In the workplace, creative thinking leads to innovation. Ironically, even as machines become more advanced, it’s our human creativity they still can’t supersede. That remains our most valuable trait.\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Theme: The Role of Education in Creativity and Motivation\n\nQ1. Do schools do enough to encourage creativity?\nIn many cases, no. Education systems still prioritize exam results and memorization. While that ensures standardization, it often neglects skills like problem-solving and imagination. To truly foster creativity, schools need to incorporate more open-ended tasks and allow room for failure.\n\n\nQ2. How can teachers keep students motivated in class?\nTeachers can make learning more engaging by connecting topics to real-life applications. Also, varying teaching methods-such as using visuals, stories, or group activities- can help. Most importantly, they should encourage questions and curiosity rather than just delivering information.\n\n\nQ3. Is boredom always a bad thing in education?\nNot necessarily. Some psychologists argue that indifferent boredom or low-stimulation moments can actually trigger imagination. If managed correctly, it can lead to new ideas. However, constant boredom caused by uninspiring lessons is definitely counterproductive."

    "text": "David Lang\nThe diagram details how recycled paper is made. Looking from an overall perspective, it is readily apparent that the process involves three main stages beginning with initial collection and transportation, followed by cleaning and processing, and lastly the rolling of the final product. The process is entirely man-made.\nIn order to produce recycled paper, used paper is first sourced and transported by conveyor belt to a processing plant. The used paper is then made into unfiltered pulp by using water and various chemicals. The pulp must then be filtered with water being removed.\nAfter filtering is complete, the filtered paper pulp is sent by a tube to a container with water and soap to be further cleaned. Air is pumped into the container and ink is removed. There is then an additional cleaning with water and chemicals before the final rolling states commence. To create useable recycled paper rolls, the cleaned and filtered pulp is placed on a conveyor belt where heated rollers flatten the paper and remove excess water.\nChat GPT\n\nOverall process: cyclical but shown in a linear step-by-step format.\nNumber of stages: 4 main stages - making pulp, filtering, cleaning, and making paper.\nRaw material: Used paper.\nEnd product: Recycled paper rolls.\nMaterials/chemicals used: Water\nKey step:\n\n\nUsed paper transported on a conveyor belt.\nMixed with water and chemicals - pulp.\nFiltered to remove larger impurities.\nCleaned using soap, air, water -&gt; removes ink.\nFinal cleaned pulp used to make paper -&gt; heated rollers + drying.\n\nUseful vocab: - Recycled materials - Industrial process - Mechanical separation - De-inking - Environmental sustainability\nThe diagram illustrates the step-by-step process involved in the production of recycled paper from used paper materials. The procedure consists of four main stages, starting with the creation of pulp and culminating in the manufacture of new paper rolls.\nIn the first stage, used paper is placed on a conveyor belt and carried to a machine where it is mixed with water and chemicals. This mixture breaks the paper down into unfiltered pulp. The pulp then moves to the next stage where is it filtered. This step removes large unwanted materials, leaving behind filtered pulp.\nIn the third stage, the filtered pulp is cleaned using water, soap, and air. This helps separate and remove ink from the pulp. Water and additional chemicals are also added to enhance the cleaning process. As a result, the pulp becomes cleaner and suitable for making new paper.\nFinally, the cleaned pulp is transferred onto a conveyor belt and passed through heated rollers. These rollers press and dry the material, forming sheets of recycled paper, which are then rolled up for reuse.\n\nEnvironment\n\nHow are environmental problems dealt with in your country? In my country, environmental issues are taken seriously, but there’s still a long way to go. The government has made some rules about pollution and waste, and there are programs to plant more trees. But I think sometimes the laws are not enforced strictly, and people still throw garbage in the wrong places. In my country, environmental problems are addressed through a combination of legislation and public awareness campaigns. For instance, the government has introduced stricter regulations on industrial emissions and waste disposal. However, enforcement remains inconsistent, and public participation is not as widespread as it could be, which limits the overall effectiveness of these measures.\nWhat can be done to make people recycle more often? I think if people know more about the benefits of recycling, they might do it more. Also, the government can give rewards or discounts to people who recycle. Putting more recycling bins around cities would help too. To encourage more frequent recycling, a combination of education and incentives could be effective. Public awareness campaigns can highlight the environmental and economic benefits of recycling, while practical steps- like providing more accessible recycling bins and offering financial incentives - can make the habit easier to adopt. Legislation that mandates in households and businesses could also play a significant role.\nWhat is the most pressing environmental problem? In my opinion, the biggest problem is air pollution, especially in big cities. The air quality is really bad because of cars and factories. It affects people’s health, and it’s hard to fix quickly. Arguably, climate change is the most urgent environmental issue we face today. It not only exacerbates other problems like extreme weather and rising sea levels but also poses serious threats to biodiversity and food security. While localized issues like air pollution are severe, climate change has a truly global impact that requires immediate and coordinated action.\nIs recycling a common practice in your country? Recycling is becoming more common, but it’s not something everyone does. Some people separate their trash at home, but many still throw everything together. It depends a lot on where you live - cities usually have more systems in place. Recycling is practiced in many parts of the country, particularly in urban areas where infrastructure is more developed. However, it’s far from universal. While some individuals and communities are highly conscientious, others lack access to proper facilities or are simply unaware of how to recycle effectively. So, it’s growing, but still inconsistent.\nAre governments or individuals more responsible? I think both are responsible. The government needs to make good rules and make people follow the, but individuals also need to care about the environment and take action. It’s a shared responsibility. While both governents and individuals play vital roles, I believe governents bear greater responsibility due to their ability to enact policies, regulate industries, and invest in sustainable infrastructure. That said, individual behavior is equally crucial, as collective action often stes fro personal choices. Ideally, both should work hand in hand to address environental issues effectively."

I usually go by bike because it’s quicker and more convenient for me. I’m lucky - my office isn’t far from where I live, so I hardly ever need to use buses or trains. But when I do, I’d say the transport links in my area are decent.\n\n\nDo you enjoy shopping in your local area?\nYes, I do! There’s a brand new shopping mall that opened just a couple of months ago. It’s not too expensive either, so I can usually find something reasonable. I’ve definitely been going there more often lately.\n\n\nHow often do you travel for work or study?\nThese days, I only need to go into the city one or two days a week. Most of the time I work from home. I really appreciate that flexibility - it saves me time and money.\n\n\nDo you like your neighborhood?\nYes, I really like it. It’s a quite area with good transport links and a lovely park nearby. The school here is one of the best in the country, and we also have a great hospital. I’ve been living here for a few years, and I’ve never had any problems.\n\n\nDo you like going to the cinema?\nAbsolutely. There’s a brand new cinema in the city center - it’s only bene open a couple of months. I’ll definitely have a look this weekend. A friend told me it’s really modern and comfortable.\n\n\nDo you often meet friends in your free time?\nI try to. If they’re free after work, I could meet them for dinner or coffee. Thursday is usually better for me because I finish early. Really appreciate any time I get to catch up with them.\n\n\nDescribe a place in your local area that you like to visit.\nYou should say: - what the place is - where it is located - how often you go there - and explain why you enjoy going there\nOne place I enjoy visiting in my local area is a small park in the suburb where I live. It’s not a huge park, but it’s peaceful and well-kept, and I’ve been going there for years. The park is just a 10-minutes walk from my home, and it’s next to a lovely little cafe. You can’t miss it - it’s right opposite the new cinema that’s only been open a couple of months. I usually go there after work, maybe one or two days a week, just to unwind.\nWhat I love most is how quiet it is. There’s hardly any traffic around, and it’s never crowded. I go by bike, which is really convenient, and it’s a great way to get a bit of exercise. Sometimes I take a book and it on a bench, or just enjoy walking around.\nI think it’s only the best things about my neighborhood. It’s not too expensive to live here, the transport links are good, and places like this park make it even better. I really appreciate having a relaxing spot so close to home.\n\n\nDo you think it’s important to have public places in cities?\nAbsolutely. I think public places like parks or community centers are essential in cities. They offer people space to relax and socialize, especially in areas where most people live in apartments. For example, the park near my house isn’t too expensive to maintain, but it really adds value to the neighborhood. I’ve been going there for years, and it’s always full of life - families, joggers, even students reading under the trees.\n\n\nWhy do people prefer to go to parks rather than shopping centers?\nI think it depends on what they’re looking for. Parks are quiet and peaceful, and they’re usually free, while shopping centers can be noisy and crowded. A lot of people are put off by the idea of spending money every time they go out, so they prefer to visit a park instead. Personally, I go by bike to my local park - it’s great exercise and doesn’t cost a thing. You should be able to enjoy your free time without spending a lot.\n\n\nWhat are the benefits of having local amenities close to home?\nThere are so many benefits. First, it saves time. If there’s a good school or a hospital nearby, that’s one less thing to worry about. For instance, in my area, we have one of the best hospitals in the country, and I really appreciate having it so close. There’s also a brand new cinema that’s only been open for a couple of months. It’s nice to have everything within walking distance - you can definitely tell that people feel more connected to their community.\n\n\nHow has the use of public spaces changed in recent years?\nI think people are using public spaces more now, especially after the pandemic. There’s more focus on outdoor activities, mental health, and work-life balance. A lot of people work from home one or two days a week now, so they have more time to enjoy places like parks or cafes. It’s also become more common for local councils to invest in public areas because they’ve realized how much people value them."

I used to go to the gym, but honestly, fitting a visit into my busy day was a bit difficult. These days, I prefer cycling in the park. It’s fun, and being out in the fresh air really helps me relax. I also enjoy in because it keeps me fit without feeling like a chore.\n\n\nDo you prefer indoor or outdoor activities?\nI definitely prefer outdoor activities. I find going for a run or a bike ride much more enjoyable than being stuck in a gym. The fresh air and scenery make it feel less like exercise. But I”ll admit - if the weather’s bad, I skip it. Only real fanatics go out in the wind and rain!\n\n\nWhat do you think about personal trainers?\nI think they can be really helpful, especially for beginners. Having someone there to encourage you can help you achieve your goals can really boost motivation. The only downside is the cost - personal trainers can be expensive, and not everyone can afford that.\n\n\nDescribe a physical activity you enjoy.\n*You should say:\nwhat the activity is\nwhere and when you do it\nwho you do it with\nand explain why you enjoy it.*\nOne physical activity I really enjoy is swimming. I usually go to an indoor pool near my house, which means I can swim any time of year regardless of the weather. I often go after work, and sometimes my friend joins me.\nWhat I like most about swimming is that it’s great for building fitness, but it’s also quite gentle on the body. It works all the muscles without putting too much strain on the joints. That said, it can be a bit solitary - you can’t exactly have a chat while swimming laps!\nStill, I find it really relaxing and satisfying. It clears my mind and keeps me in shape. I’ve also set some small goals for myself, like increasing how many laps I can do, which helps me stay motivated.\n\n\nWhy do some people enjoy physical exercise more than others?\nI think it depends on their personality and past experience. Some people enjoy exercise because they’ve built a habit and can see the progress they’re making, which keeps them motivated. Others might find it hard because they don’t feel any improvement at first, so they lost interest and give up. Also, if someone isn’t very flexible or physically confident, even simple exercises like yoga can feel surprisingly challenging.\n\n\nDo you think people today get enough physical activity?\nHonestly, I don’t think most people do. Many lead very busy lives, and fitting a workout into their schedule can be tough. Even if they join a gym, they often stop going after a few weeks. It takes a lot of determination and commitment to keep exercising regularly, especially if you’re not seeing immediate results.\n\n\nWhat can people do to stay motivated to exercise regularly?\nOne effective way is to set manageable goals. If people aim too high at the beginning, they might feel overwhelmed and give up. Having flexible targets, rewarding yourself when you reach a goal, or even exercising with a friend can make it more enjoyable and sustainable. Getting a personal trainer can also help, but that comes with a significant cost.\n\n\nIs it better to do exercise indoors or outdoors?\nIt depends on personal preference. Some people enjoy running or cycling outdoors because it gives them a sense of freedom and they get to enjoy the fresh air. Others prefer the gym or indoor pools where the environment is controlled, especially during bad weather. Personally, I find outdoor exercise more refreshing, as long as the conditions are right - I’m definitely not a fan of running in the rain."

A while ago, I did a project where I experimented with natural dyes to colour fabrics like cotton and wool. It was quite hands-on - a real practical investigation - and even thought i was time-consuming, I found it fascinating.\n\n\nHave you ever made something by hand?\nActually, yes. I once made some natural dyes myself as part of a textile design project. I thought it would just be a matter of using a teaspoon or so, but I ended up needing a whole pile of beetroot just to get a bit of colour. It took longer than I expected, but i was worth it.\n\n\nDo you enjoy doing experiments?\nI do, especially when there’s a creative element involved. I remember doing an experiment with different types of fabric - like cotton, wool, and nylon - to see how they reacted to natural and artificial dyes. I’d been going to test just one fibre at first, but then I decided to include more for comparison.\n\n\nDo you often try new things?\nYes, I like following up on things that catch my interest. For example, I once visited an exhibition and saw a display of colorful textiles, which inspired me to research natural dyes. I even found a great book about a botanic garden that specialises in dye-producing plants.\n\n\nAre you interested in art of design?\nDefinitely. I love anything visual. I once studied a dye called Tyrian purple, which was worn in ancient times by royalty because it was so rare. I didn’t use it in my project, though - it would’ve cost a fortune.\n\n\nDescribe a project or piece of work you did, either at school or at home.\nYou should say: - what the project was\n\nwhy you did it\nhow you did it\nand explain how you felt about doing it\n\nOne of the most interesting projects I’ve ever done was a textile design assignment during my final year at university. I’ve always been interested in colour and design, so I chose to focus on how natural dyes could be used to color fabrics like cotton and wool. The idea actually came from a carpet shop I visited years ago when I was on holiday with my family in Turkey. I still remember all the amazing colours, and it really stuck with me. Later, I visited exhibition at a museum, and that gave me even more ideas. I decided to follow it up for my project. The project included a practical investigation, which meant I had to prepare and test various dyes on different types of fabric - cotton, wool, and nylon. At first, I was going to use just one fibre, but I changed my mind so I could make some comparisons. I used both ready-made dyes and homemade ones. For example, I tried using beetroot, but it was more difficult than I thought. I had to chop up a whole pile of it just to get a little bit of dye, and even then, the colour wasn’t as strong as I’d hoped. It ended up being a kind of watery cream shade on the wool, which was disappointing. Despite the challenges, I really enjoyed doing the project. It was creative, and I learned a lot - not just about fabrics, but also about how to plan and carry out an investigation. It took longer than I expected, but I felt proud of the final results.\n\n\nDo you think students learn more from doing projects or from traditional classes?\nI believe students often learn more from doing hands-on projects. When they’re actively involved in a practical investigation, like testing variables or creating something from scratch, they tend to remember the experience better. For example, when I made my own natural dyes for a design project, I ended up learning much more than I would have by just reading about the process in a textbook. It encourages creativity and independent thinking.\n\n\nWhat kind of projects are most beneficial for young people ?\nI think the most useful projects are the ones that combine creativity and real-world skills. For instance, projects that involve planning, researching, or experimenting with different materials can teach valuable problem-solving skills. If young people can follow up on something they’re genuinely interested in-whether it’s science, design, or business - they’re more likely to stay motivated and take ownership of their learning.\n\n\nShould schools focus more on academic subjects or creative activities?\nIdeally, there should be a balance. Academic subjects are important, of course, but creative activities help students develop other types of intelligence- like emotional awareness, visual thinking, or innovation. In my opinion, creative projects like art, music, or even textile design allow students to express themselves and discover talents they might not explore in regular academic classes.\n\n\nWhat challenges do people face when working on creative projects?\nOne big challenge is time. Creative projects often take longer than expected. I remember thinking that dyeing fabric with natural ingredients would be simple, but I ended up needing a whole pile of beetroot just to get a weak color. Another issue is uncertainty-you don’t always know what the outcome will be. That can be discouraging if things don’t go as planned, especially if the materials cost a fortune.\n\n\nWhy do some people give up on creative hobbies or projects?\nMany people stop because they don’t see quick results. It takes a lot of commitment and patience to stick with something that doesn’t turn out perfectly the first time. Some might also abandon their projects if they lack proper guidance. For instance, without a good mentor or tutor, it’s easy to feel lost. Also, creative work can be expensive-materials, tools, or even time investment can be hard to maintain. ## Recording 4\n\n\n\n2.3.4 Vocabulary and Phrases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWord / Phrase\nMeaning / Usage\n\n\n\n\ndozing under rocks\nLightly sleeping in a warm, sheltered place\n\n\nquite common\nFrequently found or seen in a region\n\n\ndistinctive\nEasily recognizable; unique or unusual\n\n\nin contrast with\nUsed to show a clear difference\n\n\nvaried diet\nA diet including different types of food\n\n\ncrush beetles and snail shells\nShows strong jaw strength (functional ability)\n\n\npredators\nAnimals that hunt or attack others\n\n\nman-made threat\nDangers caused by humans (e.g. traffic, pollution)\n\n\nmethods of navigation\nWays an animal finds its direction or location\n\n\nterritory\nArea an animal considers its home\n\n\nmonogamous\nHaving one mate at a time; forming long-term pair bonds\n\n\nreturning to the same partner\nBehavior of repeating a relationship over time\n\n\nprotecting their young\nLooking after or defending their offspring\n\n\nno evidence to support that idea\nNo data or proof to confirm a theory\n\n\ngive the female protection\nDefensive behavior in mating context\n\n\ncollecting data by tracking\nResearch method using technology to follow subjects\n\n\nfixed this onto their tails\nDescribes how GPS units were attached\n\n\nfar fewer meetings than expected\nResearch result that showed less interaction\n\n\nhypothesis\nA theory or idea not yet proven\n\n\nself-preservation\nBehavior intended to avoid harm or danger"

    "section": "",
    "text": "In the future all cars, buses and trucks will be driverless. The only people travelling inside these vehicles will be passengers.\nDo you think the advantages of driverless vehicles outweigh the disadvantages?\nA future filled with driverless vehicles is an inevitability. In my opinion, though there are concomitant moral risks, the practical import for health such a seismic shift will be positive on the whole.\nCritics of this trend suggest that machines should not be responsible for the potential loss of human life. This argument rests on the fact when there is an accident involving humans, it is possible to either assess blame and assign punishment or accept that human error played a role. In contrast, an individual severely injured as the result of a collision caused by a machine may justly feel that all human autonomy and free will is absent from their fate. This is analogous to a natural disaster with the crucial distinction being that humanity has engineered the situation. It is human nature to prefer to control a situation rather than surrender the outcome to an autonomous machine.\nProponents of automated vehicles, on the other hand, argue the tangible ramifications concerning public safety. The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that driverless vehicles cause fewer accidents than humans. The reason for this is that humans are prone to errors related to fatigue, distractions such as smartphones, and, in some cases, altered states. Machines might experience the occasional technical error, however, they are far more consistent by comparison. In fact, the few accidents that have occurred with automated vehicles were the fault of human drivers. If all cars were driverless, this would enabled a greater\n\nIn the coming years, it is predicted that all vehicles, including cars, buses, and trucks, will operate autonomously without human drivers. While this development may raise some concerns, I firmly believe that the advantages of driverless transportation far outweigh the disadvantages.\nOne major advantage of autonomous vehicles is improved road safety. The majority of traffic accidents today are caused by human error, including distracted driving, fatigue, and impaired judgment. Driverless vehicles, on the other hand, rely on advanced sensors, algorithms, and machine learning, which allow them to make precise decisions and maintain constant awareness of their surroundings, can process vast amount of data in real time and react faster than any human driver. This can greatly reduce accidents, save lives, and lower the burden on healthcare systems. In addition, driverless technology could improve traffic flow and reduce congestion by enabling vehicles to communicate and coordinate more efficiency.\nHowever, this transformation is not without drawbacks. A major concern is job loss among professional drivers, including taxi drivers, truckers, and bus operators. The widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles could lead to large-scale unemployment in these sectors. Moreover, ethical challenges arise in situations where a vehicle must choose between two harmful outcomes, raising questions about how machines should be programmed to make such decisions.\nDespite these issues, I believe that the long-term benefits are more compelling. The reduction in traffic accidents, the potential for greater mobility for elderly and disabled individuals, and the increase in productivity for commuters are all powerful advantages. With proactive government policies, including retraining programs and strong ethical guidelines for AI systems, the negative impacts can be mitigated.\nIn conclusion, although there are valid concerns about the rise of driverless vehicles, particularly regarding employment and ethics, the positive impacts on safety, efficiency, and accessibility make this a highly promising development. Therefore, I believe the advantages clearly outweight the disadvantages."

In an earlier example we looked at, one candidate wrote, ‘On the societal level, the results may be catastrophic if this is the case’. This argument can only show clear progression if the reader can easily understand what the terms ‘if this is the case’, and ‘the results’ refer to. If these ideas remain unclear, then the whole argument will also be unclear. Thus, problems with progression are often connected to problems with cohesive devices, and to referencing in particular. These issues need to be controlled throughout your essay to achieve band 7 or above.\n # Addressing Coherence and cohesion problems\n\nUse cohesive devices effectively but cohesion between sentences is faulty\ndoes not always use referencing clearly\n\nThis paragraph shows mixed success in using cohesive devices.

This curiosity can encourage the students to emulate those qualities, which then become integrated into their own personality.\n-&gt;\nWhile doing this, the students may become curious and want to know more about these people, which could encourage the children to emulate their qualities.

This sentence would work better as a second sentence, which shows a common problem - the first sentence of the paragraph is missing. The writer’s overall argument in this paragraph seems to be that ‘schools have a lot of influence on children’s behavior’, so this idea would produce a much more appropriate first sentence.\n\n\n\nIn the final sentence, the writer makes a good attempt at linking this paragraph to the question. However, it claims that the paragraph shows that ‘the role of schools in instilling good behavior is much more crucial than that of the parent’. This conclusion is not supported by the evidence given here and so remains unclear - the role of parents is not mentioned at all. A more appropriate sentence would be: Therefore, the role of schools in instilling good behavior is a significant one.

Overfitting\n\nA model that fits the training data too well may learn noise or random fluctuations instead of the true underlying patterns.\nThis results in poor generalization to unseen or test data.\n\n\n\n2. Increased Variance\n\nMore variables increase the model’s sensitivity to small changes in data.\nA high-variance model may change dramatically with minor input changes.\n\n\n\n3. Curse of Dimensionality\n\nIn high-dimensional spaces, data becomes sparse.\nConcepts like distance, density, and similarity lose their meaning.\nMany algorithms (e.g., k-NN, clustering) perform poorly in high dimensions.\n\n\n\n4. Interpretability\n\nAdding more variables makes the model harder to interpret.\nThis is a problem in domains where transparency is important (e.g., medicine, finance).\n\n\n\n5. Computational Cost\n\nMore variables require more memory and longer training times.\nFeature selection or dimensionality reduction may be needed to manage complexity.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Summary\nTrue – Adding more variables generally improves the fit on training data,\nbut it increases the risk of overfitting, poor generalization, and computational burden.\n\n\n\n2.1.4 Best Practice\nUse techniques like cross-validation and regularization (e.g., Lasso, Ridge, dropout)\nto balance model complexity and generalization performance."

Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT)\n\nCompares:\n\nModel 1: with interaction term\nModel 2: without interaction term\n\nNull hypothesis: interaction term does not improve the model\nLRT is more robust than the Wald test, especially in small samples\n\nSteps: 1. Fit both models (with and without interaction) 2. Compute:\n\\[\n\\chi^2 = -2(\\log L_{\\text{reduced}} - \\log L_{\\text{full}})\n\\] 3. Compare with chi-square distribution (df = 1 for one interaction term)\n\n\nc. ANOVA (Analysis of Deviance)\n\nAlternative approach to compare nested models in logistic regression.\nOften used in R with anova(model1, model2, test = \"Chisq\")\n\n\n\n\n2.3.4 Note: Interaction and Information Theory\nIn the context of information theory, interaction terms in a model can be interpreted as capturing mutual information between predictor variables and their combined influence on the target.\n\n\n\n2.3.5 Interaction as Additional Information\nWithout an interaction term, a model assumes additivity: each predictor affects the outcome independently. However, if two variables jointly influence the outcome, then their interaction carries additional information beyond their individual effects.\nThis added value can be viewed as:\n\nExtra bits of information (in the sense of entropy reduction) gained by knowing the joint effect of variables\nMutual information between variables that is relevant to the response, not captured in their marginal contributions\n\n\n\n\n2.3.6 Impact on Model Performance\n\n1. Improved Predictive Power\n\nCaptures complex relationships\nLeads to better fit and generalization, if the interaction is real and not noise\n\n\n\n2. Reduced Residual Uncertainty\n\nReduces unexplained variation in the outcome\nAnalogous to decreasing entropy in the output distribution by incorporating more structure\n\n\n\n3. Better Feature Representation\n\nInteraction terms effectively encode feature combinations that correlate strongly with the outcome\nSimilar to feature engineering guided by information gain\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.7 Summary\nAdding interaction terms allows the model to capture dependency structures among variables that are meaningful to the target, thereby increasing the information the model has about the outcome. In information-theoretic terms, interactions reduce conditional entropy and increase mutual information between inputs and output."

    "text": "2.6 Problem 6:\nDescribe how in a logistic regression model, a transformation to the response variable is applied to yield a probability distribution. Why is it considered a more informative representation of the response?\n\n2.6.1 Logistic Regression: Transformation of the Response Variable\nIn logistic regression, the response variable is categorical (often binary), but the model must output continuous values to fit it using linear predictors. This is done by applying a logit transformation, and then its inverse—the logistic (sigmoid) function—to map outputs to probabilities.\n\n\n\n2.6.2 Step-by-Step Transformation\n\nLinear combination of predictors: \\[\nz = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\cdots + \\beta_k X_k\n\\]\nLogit transformation (link function): \\[\n\\text{logit}(p) = \\log\\left(\\frac{p}{1 - p}\\right) = z\n\\]\nInverse-logit (sigmoid) function to obtain probability: \\[\np = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}\n\\]\n\nThis maps any real-valued input \\(z \\in (-\\infty, \\infty)\\) into a valid probability \\(p \\in (0, 1)\\).\n\n\n\n2.6.3 Why This Is Informative\n\nProbabilistic output: Unlike hard class labels, logistic regression provides the estimated probability of belonging to a class, which gives more nuanced information.\nUncertainty awareness: Probabilities allow us to gauge confidence in predictions. For example, a prediction of 0.95 is more confident than 0.55.\nThreshold flexibility: You can choose decision thresholds based on the application (e.g., 0.5, 0.7) rather than being locked into fixed class predictions.\nSupports ranking and calibration: Probabilities are useful for ROC analysis, calibration, and expected loss minimization.\n\n\n\n\n2.6.4 Summary\nLogistic regression transforms the response variable through the logit link and uses its inverse to map model outputs to a valid probability distribution. This enables not only classification but also a more informative and interpretable representation of the predicted outcomes.\n\n\n2.6.5 Note: Pros and Cons of Output Transformations in Logistic Regression\nWhen transforming the response variable into a probability distribution, several methods can be used depending on the problem type. The most common are:\n\nSigmoid function — for binary classification\nSoftmax function — for multi-class classification\nClassic normalization — general scaling of outputs (less used in classification)\n\nBelow is a comparison of their pros and cons:\n\n\n\n2.6.6 1. Sigmoid Function\nDefinition: \\[\n\\sigma(z) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}\n\\]\nUse Case: Binary classification (2 classes)\nPros: - Simple and computationally efficient - Naturally maps real values to the interval (0, 1) - Interpretable as the probability of the positive class\nCons: - Only supports binary output - Cannot capture interactions among multiple classes - Not ideal for mutually exclusive multi-class problems\n\n\n\n2.6.7 2. Softmax Function\nDefinition: \\[\n\\text{softmax}(z_i) = \\frac{e^{z_i}}{\\sum_{j=1}^K e^{z_j}}\n\\]\nUse Case: Multi-class classification (K &gt; 2, mutually exclusive classes)\nPros: - Generalizes sigmoid to multi-class setting - Produces a valid probability distribution over \\(K\\) classes - Probabilities sum to 1, suitable for cross-entropy loss\nCons: - Sensitive to extreme values (due to exponentiation) - Less robust to outliers in inputs - Computationally more expensive than sigmoid\n\n\n\n2.6.8 3. Classic Normalization\nDefinition: \\[\n\\text{normalized}(z_i) = \\frac{z_i}{\\sum_{j=1}^K z_j}\n\\]\nUse Case: Sometimes used as an approximation or in non-logistic models\nPros: - Simple and fast - Avoids exponentiation (numerically stable)\nCons: - Not guaranteed to produce valid probabilities unless all \\(z_i \\ge 0\\) - Can yield values outside [0, 1] if inputs are not positive - Lacks probabilistic interpretation unless additional constraints are applied\n\n\n\n2.6.9 Summary Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransformation\nBest for\nOutput Range\nSums to 1\nInterpretable Probabilities\nKey Limitation\n\n\n\n\nSigmoid\nBinary classification\n(0, 1)\nNo\nYes\nNot suitable for &gt;2 classes\n\n\nSoftmax\nMulti-class classification\n(0, 1)\nYes\nYes\nSensitive to outliers\n\n\nNormalization\nHeuristic scaling\nVaries\nPossibly\nNot always\nMay not yield valid probs\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Raw model outputs (logits)\nlogits = np.array([2.0, 1.0, 0.1])\n\n# 1.

The key distinction is actually convexity:\nConvex problems (nonnegative curvature) can be solved reliably in polynomial time using interior-point methods, gradient-based schemes with global convergence guarantees, and other efficient algorithms. The feasible set and objective have no ‘valleys’ that trap algorithms in suboptimal points.\nNonconvex problems (regions of negative curvature) are generally NP-hard. They can exhibit multiple local minima, saddle points, and complex landscape features, so finding the global minimum is computationally intractable in the worst case (unless P=NP).\nThus, the presence of negative curvature (nonconvexity) — not merely ‘nonlinearity’ — is what makes an optimization problem hard to solve.\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Define convex and nonconvex functions\nconvex = lambda x: x**2\nnonconvex = lambda x: x**2 + 5*np.sin(3*x)\n\n# Domain\nx = np.linspace(-3, 3, 500)\n\n# Plot both functions\nplt.figure()\nplt.plot(x, convex(x), label='Convex: $f(x)=x^2$')\nplt.plot(x, nonconvex(x), label='Nonconvex: $f(x)=x^2+5\\sin(3x)$')\n\n# Mark minima\n# For convex, minimum at x=0\nplt.scatter(0, convex(0), color='black', label='Convex minimum')\n# For nonconvex, approximate local minima\nd = nonconvex(x)\nidx = (np.diff(np.sign(np.diff(d))) &gt; 0).nonzero()[0] + 1\nplt.scatter(x[idx], d[idx], color='red', s=20, label='Nonconvex local minima')\n\nplt.title('Convex vs Nonconvex Landscapes')\nplt.xlabel('x')\nplt.ylabel('f(x)')\nplt.legend()\nplt.tight_layout()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnegative curvature (nonconvexity) — not merely ‘nonlinearity’ — is what makes an optimization problem hard to solve."

Let the associated PDF be \\[f = F'\\].\nObjective:\nEstimate the PDF \\[f\\]. However, unlike the CDF, estimating the density function nonparametrically is not possible under the sole assumption that \\[F\\] is any CDF.\n\n\n\n7.2 Need for Additional Assumptions\n\nIll-Posed Without Smoothness:\nThe space of all CDFs (denoted by \\[\\mathcal{F}_{\\text{ALL}}\\]) is too vast; a generic CDF need not be differentiable. Even if a density exists, it can be highly irregular, making consistent estimation difficult or impossible.\nIntroducing Smoothness via Sobolev Spaces:\nTo estimate \\[f\\] reliably, we assume that \\[f\\] belongs to a more restricted function class. One common assumption is that \\[f\\] lies in a Sobolev space (denoted by \\[\\mathcal{F}_{\\text{SOB}}\\]).\nFor instance, one might assume: \\[\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\text{SOB}} = \\left\\{ f \\in \\mathcal{F}_{\\text{DENS}} : \\int \\left(f^{(s)}(x)\\right)^2 dx &lt; \\infty \\right\\},\n\\] where:\n\n\\[\\mathcal{F}_{\\text{DENS}}\\] is the set of all probability density functions.\n\\[f^{(s)}(x)\\] denotes the \\[s\\]-th derivative of \\[f\\].\nThe condition \\[\\int \\left(f^{(s)}(x)\\right)^2 dx &lt; \\infty\\] ensures that \\[f\\] is not “too wiggly” or irregular.\n\n\n\n\n7.3 Estimation Methods\n\nKernel Density Estimation (KDE):\nWith the smoothness assumption in place, methods such as kernel density estimation can be employed. A kernel density estimator has the form: \\[\n\\hat{f}_n(x) = \\frac{1}{nh} \\sum_{i=1}^n K\\left(\\frac{x - X_i}{h}\\right),\n\\] where:\n\n\\[K(\\cdot)\\] is a smooth kernel function (e.g., Gaussian).\n\\[h\\] is a bandwidth parameter that controls the smoothness of the estimate.\n\n\n\n\n7.4 Why These Assumptions are Necessary\n\nRegularization:\nThe smoothness condition imposed by the Sobolev space helps regularize the estimation problem. It restricts the set of possible densities to those that have bounded variation or a controlled number of oscillations.\nImproved Convergence:\nSmoothness assumptions lead to better convergence properties of the density estimator, allowing for rates of convergence that can be rigorously analyzed.\nPractical Feasibility:\nIn many real-world scenarios, the underlying density is indeed smooth (e.g., physical phenomena, economic variables), making this assumption both realistic and useful."

Use weights, resistance bands, or bodyweight exercises. Compound exercises that work multiple muscle groups at once are most effective for muscle growth.12\nNutrition: Eat sufficient protein from sources like lean meats, fish, eggs, dairy, legumes, and plant-based proteins. Balancing your diet with enough calories, especially after workouts, helps muscle recovery and growth. A moderate calorie surplus supports sustainable muscle gain without excess fat.34\nRest and Recovery: Muscle grows during rest, so getting 7-9 hours of quality sleep nightly and spacing strength sessions allows muscles to repair and grow stronger.56\nConsistency and Challenging Workouts: Regular, progressively challenging resistance training causes muscle adaptation and growth. Training heavy with lower repetitions for strength and including higher repetitions for hypertrophy is a good balance.78\n\n\n\n\n\nIncreasing muscle strength and mass improves metabolism, cardiovascular health, mobility, balance, and physical independence, all contributing to longevity and a better quality of life.910\nStrength training also reduces risks related to chronic diseases, injury, and mental health decline.1112\nStudies show that strength training for even 90 minutes a week can slow biological aging and potentially add years to life.13\n\nIn summary, growing muscle through tailored strength training, proper protein intake, balanced nutrition, and sufficient rest promotes better health, reduces aging impacts, and supports a longer, more independent life.Growing muscle for a longer, better life involves regularly doing strength training exercises, eating enough protein and calories, and allowing your muscles time to recover. Focus on resistance training that targets major muscle groups, especially compound movements like squats, deadlifts, and presses. Consume a balanced diet rich in protein, healthy fats, and carbohydrates to support muscle repair and growth. Prioritize rest and get quality sleep for optimal recovery.141516\nKey points to build muscle and improve life:\n\nDo strength training at least 2-3 times per week with compound exercises.\nEat sufficient protein from lean meats, fish, eggs, dairy, legumes, or plant-based sources.\nMaintain a slight calorie surplus to fuel muscle growth.\nGet 7-9 hours of quality sleep and allow recovery between workouts.\nConsistency and progressively challenging workouts are essential for muscle gain.\n\nBuilding muscle improves metabolism, heart health, mobility, balance, and reduces risks of chronic diseases and injury, which all contribute to living longer and healthier. Even 90 minutes of strength training weekly can slow aging and add years of life.\nThis combination leads to better physical and mental wellbeing, enhanced independence, and increased longevity.1718192021 222324252627282930313233\n\n⁂"

    "text": "Muscles that significantly help in living a longer and better life include skeletal muscle mass and strength, particularly in the legs, core, and overall body. Having greater muscle mass and strength is associated with lower all-cause mortality, better cardiovascular and metabolic health, improved mobility, balance, and independence as people age.\n\n\n\nGreater muscle mass relative to body size is independently linked to lower mortality risk in older adults, beyond traditional cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors. Muscle mass acts as a vital protein reserve and supports survival during illness.12\nMuscle strength, more than just muscle size, strongly predicts longevity, reducing mortality risks even when other negative metabolic or health factors are present.34\nMaintaining muscle mass supports healthy aging by preventing sarcopenia (age-related muscle loss), preserving mobility, stability, and reducing the risk of falls and injuries, all of which contribute to a better quality of life and lifespan.567\n\n\n\n\n\nLeg Muscles: Strong leg muscles are crucial as they support mobility, balance, and stability. Studies show people with stronger legs have lower mortality risk due to better cardiovascular health, blood flow, and metabolic function.8\nCore Muscles: Including those of the lower back, hips, and abdomen, core muscles support posture, reduce back pain, and improve overall balance and function, which are vital for maintaining independence with age.9\n\n\n\n\n\nMuscle-strengthening activities, including weightlifting, resistance training, squats, push-ups, and even functional movements like carrying heavy loads, help build and maintain muscle mass and strength.1011\nThese activities improve insulin sensitivity, glucose management, metabolic rate, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers.1213\nJust 30 to 60 minutes per week of muscle-strengthening exercise can increase life expectancy by 10 to 17 percent.14\n\nIn summary, building and maintaining strong skeletal muscles, especially in the legs and core, through regular strength training is key to living longer and better by promoting metabolic health, mobility, and resilience against age-related health declines.151617 18192021222324\n\n⁂"

    "text": "Investments in health can education are widely regarded as central to a nation’s economic progress. Evidence presented by Our World in Data highlights robust connections showing that improvements in population well-being and knowledge create the necessary conditions for sustained growth and prosperity. These influences operate both directly, by raising productivity, and indirectly, by triggering important demographic and social shifts.\nWith regard to health, national economic strength is closely tied to population health, and greater investment in healthcare proves highly effective, especially in poorer regions. A clear correlation has been observed between higher healthcare spending and improvements in life expectancy are achieved in nations with very low initial spending, reflecting a pattern of diminishing returns as expenditure increases. In addition, health improvements reduce vulnerability to crises, since better nutrition and sanitation have historically helped populations withstand famines and escape extreme poverty.\nHowever, financial barriers remain a serious challenge. Donor funding for health often falls as countries transition from low- to middle-income status, despite the fact that investments remain highly effective at this stage. Moreover, in many low-income nations, families continue to bear over half of all health costs out-of-pocket, creating significant obstacles for poorest households in accessing care.\nEducation is similarly presented as not merely a consequence of development but as a prerequisite for it. Historical data indicate that improvements in literacy preceded industrialization, suggesting that economic transformation required an increasingly educated public able to innovate and adopt new technologies. The rise in global literacy is striking: whereas only one in ten could read and write in 1820, today only one in ten remains illiterate. This expansion has reduced educational inequality worldwide and underpinned board-based economic growth.\nA further critical role of education lies in its impact on demographic change. Greater female education, in particular, has driven fertility decline by raising the opportunity costs of childrearing. For example, in Iran, women’s average schooling increased from a third of a year in 1950 to nine years by 2020, during which time fertility rates fell dramatically from seven to fewer than two children per woman. This shift has reinforced economic development by encouraging investment in the quality rather than the quantity of children.\nNonetheless, higher expenditure alone does not fully explain learning outcomes across countries. Evidence suggests that the quality of inputs is crucial, with teacher qualifications and experience exerting more influence than smaller class sizes. Moreover, health-related interventions such as deworming have proven exceptionally cost-effective in boosting school attendance, showing that education policy must be integrated with public health measures.\nIn conclusion, health and education investments from a virtuous cycle that underpins economic resilience and long-term growth. By improving well-being, reducing mortality, expanding literacy, and enabling demographic transition, they provide both the foundation and momentum for sustained national progress."

For instance, Aboriginal speakers who use cardinal directions rather than “left” and “right” remain consistently oriented, while Russian speakers distinguish shades of blue more quickly due to have separate words for them. Similarly, grammatical gender can alter how objects are described, and verb structures can shape how responsibility is attributed in accidents.

Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.\nGiven an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,1]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3). Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]\nOutput: 12\nExplanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).

A DSU will have an operation to combine any two sets, and it will be able to tell in which set a specific element is. The classical version also introduces a third operation, it can create a set from a new element.\nThus the basic interface of this data structure consists of only three operations: - make_set() - create a new set consisting of the new element v. - union_sets(a, b) - merges the two specified sets (the set in which the element a is located, and the set in which the element b is located). - find_set(v) - return the representative (also called leader) of the set that contains the element v. This representative is an element of its corresponding set. It is selected in each set by the data structure itself (and can change over time, namely after union_sets call). This representative can be used to check if two elements are part of the same set or not. a and b are exactly in the same set, if find_set(a) == find_set(b). Otherwise they are in different sets.\nAs described on more detail later, the data structure allows us to do each of these operations in almost \\(O(1)\\) time on average.\nAlso in one of the subsections an alternative structure of a DSU is explained, which achieves a slower average complexity of \\(O(\\log n)\\), but can be more powerful than the regular DSU structure."

It will be pretty inefficient at first, but later we can improve it using two optimizations, so that it will take nearly constant time for each function call.\nAs we said, all the information about the sets of elements will be kept in an array parent.\nTo create a new set (operation make_set(v)), we simply create a tree with root in the vertex x, meaning that it is its own ancestor.\nTo combine two sets (operation union_sets(a, b)), we first find the representative of the set in which a is located, and the representative of the set in which b is located. If the representatives are identical, that we have nothing to do, the sets are already merged. Otherwise, we can simply specify that one of the representatives is the parent of the other representative - thereby combining the two trees.\nFinally the implementation of the find representative function (operation find_set(v)): we simply climb the ancestors of the vertex v until we reach the root, i.e. a vertex such that the reference to the ancestor leads to itself. This operation is easily implemented recursively.\nvoid make_set(int v) {\n    parent[v] = v;\n}\n\nint find_set(int v) {\n    if (v == parent[v])\n        return v;\n    return find_set(parent[v]);\n}\n\nvoid union_sets(int a, int b) {\n    a = find_set(a);\n    b = find_set(b);\n    if (a != b)\n        parent[b] = a;\n}\nHowever this implementation is inefficient. It is easy to construct an example, so that the trees degenerate into long chains. In that case each call find_set(v) can take \\(O(n)\\) time.\nThis is far away from the complexity that we want to have (nearly constant time). Therefore we will consider two optimizations that will allow to significantly accelerate the work."

On the left there is a tree, and on the right side there is the compressed tree after calling find_set(7), which shortens the paths for the visited node 7, 5, 3 and 2.\n![[DSU_path_compression.png]]\nThe new implementation of find_set is as follows:\nint find_set(int v) {\n    if (v == parent[v])\n        return v;\n    return parent[v] = find_set(parent[v]);\n}\nThe simple implementation does what was intended: first find the representative of the set (root vertex), and then in the process of stack unwinding the visited nodes are attached directly to the representative.\nThis simple modification of the operation already achieves the time complexity \\(O(\\log n)\\) per call on average (here without proof).

In the naive implementation the second tree always got attached to the first one. In practice that can lead to trees containing chains of length \\(O(n)\\). With this optimization we will avoid this by choosing very carefully which tree gets attached.\nThere are many possible heuristic that can be used. Most popular are the following two approaches: In the first approach we use the size of the trees as rank, and in the second one we use the depth of the tree (more precisely, the upper bound on the tree depth, because the depth will get smaller when applying path compression).\nIn both approaches the essence of the optimization is the same: we attach the tree with the lower rank to the one with the bigger rank.\nHere is the implementation of union by size:\nvoid make_set(int v) {\n    parent[v] = v;\n    size[v] = 1;\n}\n\nvoid union_sets(int a, int b){\n    a = find_set(a);\n    b = find_set(b);\n    if (a != b) {\n        if (size[a] &lt; size[b])\n            swap(a, b);\n        parent[b] = a;\n        size[a] += size[b];\n    }\n}\nand here is the implementation of union by rank based on the depth of the trees:\nvoid make_set(int v) {\n    parent[v] = v;\n    rank[v] = 0;\n}\n\nvoid union_sets(int a, int b) {\n    a = find_set(a);\n    b = find_set(b);\n    if (a != b) {\n        if (rank[a] &lt; rank[b])\n            swap(a, b);\n        parent[b] = a;\n        if (rank[a] == rank[b])\n            rank[a]++;\n    }\n}\nBoth optimizations are equivalent in terms of time and space complexity.

In fact it grows so lowly, that it doesn’t exceed 4 for all reasonable \\(n\\) (approximately \\(n&lt;10^{600}\\)).\nAmortized complexity is the total time per operation, evaluated over a sequence of multiple operations. The idea is to guarantee the total time of the entire sequence, while allowing single operations to be much slower than the amortized time. E.g. in our case a single call might take \\(O(\\log n)\\) in the worst case, but if we do \\(m\\) such calls back to back we will end up with an average time of \\(O(\\alpha (n))\\).\nWe will also not present a proof for this time complexity, since it is quite long and complicated.\nAlso, it’s worth mentioning that DSU with union by size / rank, but without path compression works in \\(O(\\log n)\\) time per query."

    "text": "Linking by index / coin-flip linking\nBoth union by rank and union by size require that we store additional data for each set, and maintain these values during each union operation. There exist also a randomized algorithm, that simplifies the union operation a little bit: linking by index.\nWe assign each set a random value called the index, and we attach the set with the smaller index to the one with the larger one. It is likely that a bigger set will have a bigger than the smaller set, therefore this operation is closely related to union by size. In fact it can be proven, that this operation has the same time complexity as union by size. However in practice it is slightly slower than union by size."

    "text": "Imagine you’re on a circular road trip with your car, visiting a series of gas stations. Each station provides a certain amount of gas, but it also costs you gas to drive to the next one. The question is: Can you complete the entire loop starting at one of the stations, without ever running out of fuel?\nThis is the essence of the Gas Station Problem, a well-known greedy algorithm question that tests your ability to reason about cumulative gains and losses over a circular path.\nAt first glance, this might seem like a brute-force problem—try every station as a starting point, simulate the journey, and check which one works. But with some smart observations, we can reduce the solution from O(n²) to O(n) using a greedy strategy.\nIn this post, we’ll guide you step-by-step: - From a naive brute-force solution, - To discovering key mathematical observations, and - Finally building an efficient greedy algorithm with a visual explanation.\nWhether you’re preparing for coding interviews, learning algorithms, or building animations with Manim, this deep dive will help you not only solve the problem but also understand the “why” behind the solution."

If a position is flipped an odd number of times, its value changes, but if it is flipped an even number of times, it stays the same.\nConsider the array [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1]. We start by flipping three consecutive elements to try and transform all 0s into 1s. First, flipping the subarray [0, 0, 1] at indices 1..3 changes the array to [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]. Then, flipping [0, 0, 1] at indices [3..5] gives [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1]. Finally, flipping [1, 0, 1] at indices [1, 0, 1] at indices 4..6 results in [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0].\nAt this point, we see that the 0s at positions 4 and 6 remain, and there is no way to flip them without also flipping the other elements. Since we can only flip three elements at a time, we cannot isolate these 0s in a way that allow us to change them to 1s. This happens because these positions were flipped an even number of times, so they retain their original value. Because of this parity constraint, the transformation is impossible."

Each line has 10 cards (5 for Player 1 and 5 for Player 2). The task is to determine how many times Player 1 wins.\n\n\n2 Intuition\nTo solve this, we must: - Parse the file and separate the cards. - Evaluate the rank of each player’s hand. - Compare both hands. - Count the number of times Player 1 wins.\n\n\n3 Approach\nWe will: 1. Create a value mapping for cards from '2' to 'A'. 2. Implement a hand evaluation function that returns a tuple containing: - A numeric rank code (higher is better), - A tie-breaker list of card values. 3. Read the file line-by-line, split the hands, and apply the evaluation. 4. Use tuple comparison to determine the winner.\n\n\n4 Full Python Implementation\nfrom collections import Counter\n\n# Step 1: Value mapping\nCARD_VALUES = {'2': 2, '3': 3, '4': 4, '5': 5,\n               '6': 6, '7': 7, '8': 8, '9': 9,\n               'T': 10, 'J': 11, 'Q': 12, 'K': 13, 'A': 14}\n\n# Step 2: Evaluate hand\ndef hand_rank(hand):\n    values = sorted([CARD_VALUES[c[0]] for c in hand], reverse=True)\n    suits = [c[1] for c in hand]\n    counts = Counter(values)\n    count_vals = sorted(counts.items(), key=lambda x: (-x[1], -x[0]))\n    ordered_values = [val for val, cnt in count_vals]\n\n    is_flush = len(set(suits)) == 1\n    is_straight = values == list(range(values[0], values[0]-5, -1))\n\n    if is_straight and is_flush:\n        return (8, values)\n    elif count_vals[0][1] == 4:\n        return (7, ordered_values)\n    elif count_vals[0][1] == 3 and count_vals[1][1] == 2:\n        return (6, ordered_values)\n    elif is_flush:\n        return (5, values)\n    elif is_straight:\n        return (4, values)\n    elif count_vals[0][1] == 3:\n        return (3, ordered_values)\n    elif count_vals[0][1] == 2 and count_vals[1][1] == 2:\n        return (2, ordered_values)\n    elif count_vals[0][1] == 2:\n        return (1, ordered_values)\n    else:\n        return (0, values)\n\n# Step 3: Compare two hands\ndef player1_wins(hand1, hand2):\n    return hand_rank(hand1) &gt; hand_rank(hand2)\n\n# Step 4: Process file\ndef count_player1_wins(filename='poker.txt'):\n    count = 0\n    with open(filename) as f:\n        for line in f:\n            cards = line.strip().split()\n            hand1 = cards[:5]\n            hand2 = cards[5:]\n            if player1_wins(hand1, hand2):\n                count += 1\n    return count\n\n# Step 5: Output result\nprint(count_player1_wins())\n\n\n5 Complexity\n\nTime Complexity: \\(N(N\\log N)\\) per hand due to sorting, where \\(N=5\\). Since it’s constant-sized, it is effectively \\(O(1)\\) per hand. Processing 1,000 hands is \\(O(1,000)\\) total.\nSpace Complexity: Also \\(O(1)\\) per hand due to fixed size.\n\n\n\n6 Conclusion\nThis problem combines string parsing, sorting, and custom rule-based comparison logic. It’s an excellent example of how domain-specific logic (poker hand rules) can be embedded into structured programmatic comparisons.\nYou can adapt this solution to simulate poker games, build bots, or explore probability distributions of poker hands."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Question\nThere is an undirected weighted graph with n vertices labeled from 0 to n - 1.\nYou are given the integer n and an array edges, where edges[i] = [ui, vi, wi] indicates that there is an edge between vertices ui and vi with a weight of wi.\nA walk on a graph is a sequence of vertices and edges. The walk starts and ends with a vertex, and each edge connects the vertex that comes before it and the vertex that comes after it. It’s important to note that a walk may visit the same edge or vertex more than once.\nThe cost of a walk starting at node u and ending at node v is defined as the bitwise AND of the weights of the edges traversed during the walk. In other words, if the sequence of edge weights encountered during the walk is w0, w1, w2, …, wk, then the cost is calculated as w0 & w1 & w2 & … & wk, where & denotes the bitwise AND operator.\nYou are also given a 2D array query, where query[i] = [si, ti]. For each query, you need to find the minimum cost of the walk starting at vertex si and ending at vertex ti. If there exists no such walk, the answer is -1.\nReturn the array answer, where answer[i] denotes the minimum cost of a walk for query i.\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 5, edges = [[0,1,7],[1,3,7],[1,2,1]], query = [[0,3],[3,4]]\nOutput: [1,-1]\nExplanation:\nTo achieve the cost of 1 in the first query, we need to move on the following edges: 0-&gt;1 (weight 7), 1-&gt;2 (weight 1), 2-&gt;1 (weight 1), 1-&gt;3 (weight 7).\nIn the second query, there is no walk between nodes 3 and 4, so the answer is -1.\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 3, edges = [[0,2,7],[0,1,15],[1,2,6],[1,2,1]], query = [[1,2]]\nOutput: [0]\nExplanation:\nTo achieve the cost of 0 in the first query, we need to move on the following edges: 1-&gt;2 (weight 1), 2-&gt;1 (weight 6), 1-&gt;2 (weight 1).\nConstraints:\n2 &lt;= n &lt;= 105\n0 &lt;= edges.length &lt;= 105\nedges[i].length == 3\n0 &lt;= ui, vi &lt;= n - 1\nui != vi\n0 &lt;= wi &lt;= 105\n1 &lt;= query.length &lt;= 105\nquery[i].length == 2\n0 &lt;= si, ti &lt;= n - 1\nsi != ti\n\n\nAnalysis\nLet’s determine when the answer to a query is -1. This happens when no walk exists between the two nodes, meaning they belong to different connected components.\nNow, suppose the two nodes belong to the same connected component. What is the minimum cost of a walk connecting them? As mentioned, the optimal walk includes as many edges as possible. Since revisiting an edge does not affect the total score, we can freely traverse the edges of the component, meaning that we can move back and forth to reach all of them. Therefore, the best way to achieve the lowest cost is to visit every edge in the component.\nTo efficiently find and process the connected components of the graph, we use the Disjoint Set (Union-Find) data structure. When we Union two nodes, we merge their entire groups, as now a path exists between every node in one group and every node in the other. To maintain efficiency, the root of the larger group is chosen as the representative of the merge group. This minimizes the time needed for future Find operations by reducing the number of steps required to reach the current representative."

    "text": "Benefits from containers\nContainers package applications. In different scenarios: ### Scenario 1: Works on my machine\nLet’s first take a closer look into what happens in web development without containers following the chain above starting from “Plan”.\nFirst we plan an application. Then our team of 1-n developers create the software. It works on one’s computer. It may even go through a testing pipeline working perfectly. We send it to the server and it does not work.\nThis is known as the “works on my machine” problem. The only way to solve this is by finding out what in tarnation the developer had installed on their machine that made the application work.\nContainers solve this problem by allowing the developer to personally run the application inside a container, which then includes all of the dependencies required for the app to work.\n\nYou may still occasionally hear about “works in my container” issues - these are often just usage errors. ### Scenario 2: Isolated environments\n\nWe have 5 different Python applications. We need to deploy them to a server that already has an application requiring Python 2.7 and of course none of our applications are 2.7. What do we do now?\nSince containers package the software with all of its dependencies, we package the existing app and all 5 new ones with their respective Python versions and that’s it.\nSometimes different parts of a system may change over time, possibly leading to the application not working. These changes may be anything from an operating system update to changes in dependencies.\n\nScenario 3: Development\nWe are brought into a dev team. They run a web app that uses other services when running: a Postgres database, MongoDB, Redis and a number of others. Simple enough, we install whatever is required to run the application and all of the applications that it depends on …\nWhat a headache to start installing and then managing the development databases on your own machine.\nThankfully, by the time we are told to do that we are already a Docker expert. With one command we get an isolated application, like Postgres or Mongo, running in our machine.\n\n\nScenario 4: Scaling\nStarting and stopping a Docker container has little overhead. But when we run our own Netflix or Facebook, we want to meet the changing demand. With some advanced tooling that we will learn about in parts 2 and 3, we can spin up multiple containers instantly and load balance traffic between them.\nContainer orchestration will be discussed in parts 2 and 3. But the simplest example: what happens when one application dies? The orchestration system notices it, splits traffic between the working replicas, and spins up a new container to replace the dead one."

Containers, on the other hand, share the host OS kernel and only package the application and its dependencies, resulting in a more lightweight and efficient solution.\nVMs provide strong isolation and are suited for running multiple OS environments, but they have a performance overhead and longer startup times. Containers offer faster startup, better resource utilization, and high portability across different environments, though their isolation is at the process level, which may not be as robust as that of VMs. Overall, VMs could be used for scenarios needing complete OS environments, while containers excel in lightweight, efficient, and consistent application deployment.\nDocker relies on Linux kernels, which means that macOS and Windows cannot run Docker natively without some additional steps. Each operating system has its own solution for running docker."

    "text": "Image and containers\nSince we already know what containers are it’s easier to explain images through them: Containers are instances of images. A basic mistake is to confuse images and containers.\nCooking metaphor:\nThink of a container as a ready-to-eat meal that we can simply heat up and consume. An image, on the other hand, is the recipe and the ingredients for that meal.\nSo just like how we need a recipe and ingredients to make a meal, we need an image and a container runtime (Docker engine) to create a container. The image provides all the necessary instructions and dependencies for the container to run, just like a recipe provides the steps and ingredients to make a meal.\nIn short, an image is like a blueprint or template and the building material, while a container is an instance of that blueprint or template.\n\nImage\nA Docker image is a file. An image never changes; we cannot edit an existing file. Creating a new image happens by starting from a base image and adding new layers to it. We will talk about layers later, but we should think of images as immutable, they can not be changed after they are created.\nList all of ours image with docker image ls\n$ docker image ls\n  REPOSITORY      TAG      IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE\n  hello-world     latest   d1165f221234   9 days ago      13.3kB\nContainers are created from images, so when we ran hello-world twice we downloaded one image and created two of them from the single image.\nWell then, if images are used to create containers, where do images come from? This image file is built from an instructional file named Dockerfile that is parsed when we run docker image build.\nDockerfile is a file that is by default called Dockerfile, that looks something like this\nFROM &lt;image&gt;:&lt;tag&gt;\n\nRUN &lt;install some dependencies&gt;\n\nCMD &lt;command that is executed on `docker container run`&gt;\nand is the instruction set for building an image. We will look into Dockerfiles later when we to build our own images.\nIf we go back to the cooking metaphor, as Dockerfile provides the instructions needed to build an image we can think of that as the recipe for images. We’re now 2 recipes deep, as a Dockerfile is the recipe for an image and an image is the recipe for the container. The only difference is that Dockerfile is written by us, whereas image is written by our machine based on the Dockerfile."

    "text": "The alarm buzzed at 5:30 AM, its shrill tone slicing through the heavy stillness like a razor across silk.\nHis eyes opened immediately — not with urgency, but as if the body simply knew its cue. He lay motionless for a few seconds, staring at the ceiling with the faint outline of a water stain slowly coming into focus. In the dim light, it looked like a cracked map — a world he didn’t recognize, a world he didn’t belong to.\nThe mattress beneath him groaned as he sat up, its foam already flattened from months of use. It wasn’t a bed, really — just layers of fabric and compromise. Cold air brushed his ankles. He instinctively reached for the old hoodie crumpled at the foot of the bed, pulling it over his thin T-shirt.\nThe room around him remained hushed.\nJust 12 square meters. No decoration. No luxury. Just purpose.\nThe desk dominated one wall — a battlefield of papers, pens, books in English and Vietnamese, sticky notes curled at the corners. One notebook lay open with a sentence written five times over, the ink pressure weakening at the final repetition:\n\n“I will reach my future.”\n\nBeside the notebook was a photo frame, turned face-down.\nHe stood slowly, stretching with the careful control of someone trying not to wake a sleeping world. A small, steel pot sat on the single-burner gas stove. The same one his father had used when working construction far from home. He filled it with water, hands moving on habit, and struck a match. The gas hissed, then bloomed into a trembling flame.\nHe listened to the soft crackling of the fire beneath the kettle, its rhythm grounding. That sound — that modest ritual — was the anchor of his mornings.\nOutside the window, the city was still in slumber. Motorbikes hadn’t yet started their impatient chorus. Street vendors hadn’t called out their breakfast offers. Even the sky felt distant — still inked in predawn gray.\nHe poured in two spoonfuls of coarse Vietnamese coffee into the metal filter. It hissed faintly as the water passed through, dripping slow and dark into a chipped enamel mug. The bitter scent rose quickly, filling the room, warm and familiar like an old friend who never asked questions.\nHe took a seat at the desk, hands cupped around the mug for heat. Steam rose, soft and ghostly, curling upward and disappearing into the shadows near the ceiling.\nHe didn’t check his phone. He didn’t open his laptop.\nHe just sat — drinking in silence, drinking in stillness.\nA voice echoed in his mind — his own voice, recorded days ago and played back over and over:\n\n“Improve your emotions. Control your mind. That’s how you win in both love and research.”\n\nHe sipped.\n\n“Outside, the world slept. Inside, he fought another silent battle — one more morning, one more step.”\n\nHe pulled a notebook close and uncapped a pen.\nToday, he would revise two math lectures, solve three GRE quant problems, read one research paper on medical AI.\nToday, he would not talk about sadness. He would fold it into equations.\nThe clock ticked softly.\nIt was 5:47 AM.\nThe city would wake soon.\nBut for now —\nthis hour was his alone.\n\nThe glow of the phone screen pierced the dim light of the room.\nHe hadn’t meant to look at it. He just wanted to check the time. But there she was—framed in a memory.\nA photo from last year: the two of them sitting on the rooftop of her dorm, a bowl of instant noodles between them, steam rising like a soft cloud in the night air. She was laughing, her eyes crinkled in that way that always made his chest feel like it had too much inside.\nHe hadn’t laughed like that in a long time. Not from the chest. Not the kind of laugh that felt like breathing again after holding it too long.\nThe silence of the present closed in tighter.\nHe set the phone down beside him, carefully, like it might break. Or maybe like he might.\nLove had been real—so real it colored the days in bright, foolish light. In those early months, he thought they could beat everything: stress, family pressure, burnout, even the creeping doubt that sometimes bloomed behind his quiet smile.\nBut the days grew longer. Work harder. Rejections heavier.\nStill, he remembered something.\nThe day he opened his first AI textbook.\nIt wasn’t in class. It was late at night, on his laptop, sitting cross-legged on the cold tiled floor of a rented room just like this one. A YouTube lecture had introduced him to neural nets, and something clicked.\nFor a few hours, the world made sense. Not perfectly—but enough to believe that learning could mean something. That understanding could give shape to a chaotic life.\nIn that moment, ambition was born—not as arrogance, but as hope.\nHe want to be rich. Or famous.\nHe just wanted to be capable.\nCapable enough to earn respect.\nCapable enough to take care of her.\nCapable enough to build something that might one day help someone else like him.\nThat night, he whispered to himself like a vow:\n\n“I’ll keep going. Even if it’s just me.”\n\nHe rose from the mattress, stretched, and stood barefoot on the cold tile. The kettle hissed. Coffee would be ready soon.\nHe walked to the desk—cluttered with scribbled notes, research printouts, half-read papers. In the corner of the table sat a worn-out notebook. Spiral-bound, the first few pages curled from use.\nHe opened it slowly.\nThe handwriting was messier back then. The first page:\n“Study Plan: Deep Learning – 6 Months.”\nWritten in neat boxes, optimistic bullets.\nA line underneath:\n“If I don’t give up, something will change.”\nHe smiled. Not a happy smile—something softer, tinged with nostalgia and a little pity.\nBack then, everything had seemed clearer. Simpler.\nStudy, love, sleep. Repeat.\nEven when the world around him felt uncertain, he believed he could will his future into existence with enough effort.\nAnd he wasn’t alone.\nShe used to sit beside him in coffee shops, studying her own books.\nShe once said:\n\n“You look cute when you’re focused… like you’re trying to save the world with math.”\n\nHe didn’t answer then—too shy maybe. But he’d never forgotten that line.\nBecause for a moment, someone saw him—not for what he lacked, but for what he could become.\nHe turned another page.\nA rough sketch of a neural net. Then a heart drawn next to it, her doodle. Tiny letters beside it:\n\n“Your brain is full of wires, but your heart is still soft.”\n\nThat version of her—playful, loving, a little chaotic—felt distant now.\nWork had changed her. And him.\nDeadlines stretched her thin. His own studies turned inward.\nCalls became shorter. Messages slower.\nYet the ache remained constant, like phantom warmth on a cold bed.\nHe sat down and let the notebook rest on his lap. The past wasn’t painful because it was gone. It was painful because it was beautiful.\nAnd because beauty, once tasted, is hard to live without.\nHe took a sip of coffee. Bitter. No sugar—just how he liked it now.\nSomewhere along the way, he had stopped sweetening things. Drinks. Words. Feelings.\nHe stared at the wall, blank except for a single printed quote he’d taped months ago:\n\n“Pursue what is meaningful, not what is expedient.” — Jordan B. Peterson.\n\nHe remembered printing it after a fight with her.\nA stupid fight. About time, about attention, about promises made and slowly broken by exhaustion.\nBack then, he thought that pursuing meaning meant pushing harder—more study, more knowledge, more progress.\nBut now… he wondered if meaning had slipped quietly out of the room when he chose books over soft conversations.\nLove, he realized, didn’t vanish in a day.\nIt faded. Like a photograph left in sunlight.\nSlowly. Softly. Until you’re not sure whether it’s still there or just the memory of it.\nShe never said, “I don’t love you anymore.”\nBut her silences had grown longer. Her eyes dimmer when they met his.\nAnd he—so obsessed with building a future—forgot to share the present.\nHe tapped the screen of his phone. That photo of them—her hand curled into his hoodie sleeve, his head leaning on hers. It was still there.\nStill glowing.\nStill warm.\nBut like all light, it came from the past.\nHe took a deep breath, then reached for his pen.\nAt the bottom of the notebook page, beneath the heart and the wires, he wrote:\n\n“Maybe study stayed not because it was easier—\nbut because it never stopped needing me.”\n\nThen he closed the notebook, slowly. Deliberately.\nAnd turned back to the desk.\nOutside, the city began to wake.\nInside, he returned to his war — no longer for love or even ambition,\nbut for something quieter: understanding. Clarity. Peace.\nAnd perhaps, one day, a new kind of connection.\n\nThe phone buzzed again.\nHe turned it over slowly—almost lazily—as if stalling would soften whatever was waiting on the other side.\nSubject: “Application Update — Regretfully…”\nHe didn’t open it.\nHe didn’t need to.\nThe first words told enough.\nA sigh escaped him—not frustration, not sorrow—something in between. A tiredness that had long since fused with his bones.\nHis thumb slid across the screen, flicking the email away like swatting a fly.\nBut just as he reached to set the phone down, another message popped up.\nA notification from someone he hadn’t heard from in over a year:\n\n“Yo bro. You still trying that PhD thing?”\n\nNo punctuation. No judgment in the words.\nBut somehow, he could feel it.\nLike a smirk hidden behind the screen.\nOr maybe, he just imagined it. Maybe his own doubt turned that sentence into a sting.\nHis eyes stayed fixed on the message for a long moment.\nHe thought about replying. A joke, a shrug, maybe even a proud “Yeah.”\nBut his fingers didn’t move.\nInstead, he locked the screen.\nAnd stood up.\nIn the corner of his room, a thin GRE prep book leaned sideways on the shelf—creased, scuffed, and opened too many times to count.\nHe took it, dropped it onto the desk with a soft thud, and opened to a random page.\nReading comprehension. Dense academic language.\nA paragraph about evolutionary biology and signal theory.\nExactly the kind of thing that had made his brain knot up when he started months ago.\nBut this time, he didn’t hesitate.\nHe sat up straighter.\nAnd began to read aloud.\n\n“In animal behavior, a signal is any act or structure that alters the behavior of another organism…”\n\nHis accent was thick. Some words stuck like stones in his throat.\nHe stumbled over “intraspecific.” Mispronounced “evolutionary.”\nPaused. Then started again.\nSlower. Clearer.\nThere was no audience here. No teacher to correct him.\nJust the empty room and the rhythm of quiet effort.\nAnd still—he kept going.\n\n“These signals, whether visual, auditory, or chemical, serve as evolutionary tools of survival and selection…”\n\nHis voice cracked near the end of the sentence.\nHe stopped—not because of a mistake, but because something in his chest tightened.\nHe looked down at the page.\nThe black print blurred slightly.\nHe blinked hard, rubbed at his eyes. No use.\nThe ache wasn’t in the eyes—it was deeper.\nHe leaned back. Stared at the peeling ceiling of the tiny room.\nSomewhere, a neighbor’s kettle whistled.\nA dog barked once in the alleyway below.\nAnd everything inside him was quiet.\nNot peaceful.\nJust… heavy.\nHe wasn’t crying.\nBut he wasn’t far from it.\nA familiar voice echoed in his head.\nClearer than anything else in that room.\n\n“You’re too emotional for this path. Academia… it’s for people with tougher skin.”\n\nShe hadn’t meant it cruelly when she said it.\nBut it had stayed with him.\nStrangely, it stuck even more than “I love you.”\nHis hands clenched the edge of the table.\nThe silence returned. This time, heavier.\nHe didn’t scream. Didn’t throw the book.\nBut his eyes moved to the wall—where old sticky notes, scribbled formulas, and quotes were scattered.\nAnd suddenly, he reached for a pen.\nIn the corner of a blue post-it, he wrote in sharp black ink:\n\n“Strong is quiet. Brave is small. But still continues.”\n\nHe pinned it to the wall.\nBetween “GRE word list #3” and “Machine Learning derivation notes.”\nHe stared at it.\nThen sat back down.\nAnd turned the page.\nThe next passage was even harder.\nDense academic vocabulary.\nPassive voice. Long, winding clauses.\nExactly the kind of English that made his brain stall, twist, freeze.\nHe hesitated.\nThen — one breath.\nAnd another.\nHis voice was quiet but steady now.\n\n“The complexity of social cognition in non-human primates suggests an evolutionary substrate for human empathy…”\n\nEach word landed like a footstep across ice.\nDelicate. Intentional. Uncertain, but forward.\nThe sentence ended.\nHe looked up again.\nNo applause.\nNo reward.\nBut something inside him… didn’t sink this time.\nHe glanced at the post-it note again.\n\n“Still continues.”\n\nThe room still felt small.\nStill felt quiet.\nStill smelled like instant coffee and faded paper.\nBut he had moved.\nNot far. Not fast.\nBut he had moved.\nAnd maybe, in this kind of life — in the slow becoming of something — that was enough.\n\nThe room was still.\nHe sat quietly, his eyes drifting between the books in front of him and the words now echoing in his mind.\nNot from a professor.\nNot from a textbook.\nBut from her.\n\n“You’re emotionally too soft for academia.”\n\nShe hadn’t said it to hurt him.\nNot exactly.\nIt was in one of those long conversations — the kind that turn into arguments without anyone meaning to.\nShe had been tired.\nHe had been defensive.\nAnd somewhere between caring and frustration, she let it slip.\nBut words like that don’t just slip away.\nThey stay.\nHe closed his eyes. He could still see her face that day.\nThe furrow in her brow.\nThe worry behind the anger.\nShe didn’t say it because she hated him.\nShe said it because she didn’t think he would survive the world he wanted to step into.\nAnd maybe… maybe part of him believed it, too.\nHe leaned back in his chair, letting the weight of her voice settle into the quiet.\nOutside, the city was waking up slowly — a distant motorbike, the clatter of someone unlocking a gate.\nBut inside, it was still just him… and that sentence.\n\n“You’re emotionally too soft for academia.”\n\nHe had replayed it too many times.\nLike a scar he couldn’t stop touching.\nLike a mirror that only showed what was broken.\nHe wasn’t the loudest in seminars.\nHe wasn’t quick with comebacks.\nWhen the first professor scoffed at his statement during a journal club, he just sat there — flushed, hands shaking, voice too dry to speak.\nAnd now, he wondered…\nHad she seen it before he did?\nThat maybe, deep down, he wasn’t made for this?\nBut then —\nSomething sparked.\nSomething small.\nHis eyes caught the edge of a bright yellow post-it note on the shelf.\nA scrap he’d written in the haze of one long night when he wanted to quit but didn’t.\nHe reached for it.\nBent edges. Slanted ink. But still readable.\n\n“Strong is quiet. Brave is small. But still continues.”\n\nHe held it.\nRead it again.\nAnd again.\nLike a vow whispered only to himself.\n\nThe metal latch clicked softly as he slid the window open.\nA breath of cool air drifted in, carrying the scent of wet concrete and faraway exhaust — the unmistakable perfume of early morning in the city.\nOutside, the buildings stood like silent sentinels in the fog.\nThey were gray. Distant. Almost weightless in the mist.\nFrom his tiny room, the world looked… blurred.\nBut not empty.\nHe rested his hands on the windowsill, elbows slightly trembling, either from the chill or the hours he hadn’t slept. His breath left a small cloud on the glass.\nFor a moment, there were no books.\nNo rejections.\nNo comparisons.\nNo her.\nJust him.\nAnd the city, stretching beyond reach.\nHe looked at the horizon, where the fog thinned.\nA faint line of orange appeared — not quite sunrise, not yet.\nAnd he whispered to the morning air:\n\n“One day… one day I’ll make it.”\n\nThe vow wasn’t loud.\nIt didn’t need to be.\nIt wasn’t for anyone else.\nIt was for the version of him that still believed.\nThe one buried beneath the tired eyes, the slow progress, the heartbreak."

His desk is full of papers.\nThe sun hasn’t risen. The city is still asleep.\nCoffee boils in a small metal pot. The sound is the only thing breaking the silence.\n(Possible line) “Outside, the world slept. Inside, he fought another silent battle — one more morning, one more step.”\n🕰️ Section 2: Flashback or Reflection He sees the photo of his girlfriend and him on the phone.\nThinks about the last time he truly laughed — maybe when she was beside him.\nThat moment of hope when he first opened a textbook on AI and believed in a better future.\n“Love was warm. But it faded. Study was hard. But it stayed.”\n✉️ Section 3: Small Action or Event He checks his phone: one academic rejection email.\nThen, a message from an old friend: “You still trying that PhD thing?”\nHe sighs. But then, he opens the GRE prep book anyway.\nChooses a difficult passage to read aloud in English.\n🧠 Section 4: Internal Growth or Setback He almost breaks down reading aloud, but he doesn’t.\nRecalls his ex’s words: “You’re emotionally too soft for academia.”\nHe clenches his fist. He writes a quote on a post-it: “Strong is quiet. Brave is small. But still continues.”\nPins it to the wall.\n🌫️ Section 5: Chapter Close He opens the window. Fog outside.\nThe sky turns a pale orange.\nHe whispers: “One day… one day I’ll make it.”\nThe city begins to wake up. But for him, it already began."

    "text": "Muscles that significantly help in living a longer and better life include skeletal muscle mass and strength, particularly in the legs, core, and overall body. Having greater muscle mass and strength is associated with lower all-cause mortality, better cardiovascular and metabolic health, improved mobility, balance, and independence as people age.\n\n\n\nGreater muscle mass relative to body size is independently linked to lower mortality risk in older adults, beyond traditional cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors. Muscle mass acts as a vital protein reserve and supports survival during illness.12\nMuscle strength, more than just muscle size, strongly predicts longevity, reducing mortality risks even when other negative metabolic or health factors are present.34\nMaintaining muscle mass supports healthy aging by preventing sarcopenia (age-related muscle loss), preserving mobility, stability, and reducing the risk of falls and injuries, all of which contribute to a better quality of life and lifespan.567\n\n\n\n\n\nLeg Muscles: Strong leg muscles are crucial as they support mobility, balance, and stability. Studies show people with stronger legs have lower mortality risk due to better cardiovascular health, blood flow, and metabolic function.8\nCore Muscles: Including those of the lower back, hips, and abdomen, core muscles support posture, reduce back pain, and improve overall balance and function, which are vital for maintaining independence with age.9\n\n\n\n\n\nMuscle-strengthening activities, including weightlifting, resistance training, squats, push-ups, and even functional movements like carrying heavy loads, help build and maintain muscle mass and strength.1011\nThese activities improve insulin sensitivity, glucose management, metabolic rate, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers.1213\nJust 30 to 60 minutes per week of muscle-strengthening exercise can increase life expectancy by 10 to 17 percent.14\n\nIn summary, building and maintaining strong skeletal muscles, especially in the legs and core, through regular strength training is key to living longer and better by promoting metabolic health, mobility, and resilience against age-related health declines.151617 18192021222324\n\n⁂"

    "text": "Growing muscle for a better life involves a combination of regular strength training, proper nutrition, and adequate rest. Prioritizing resistance exercises that target major muscle groups, especially compound movements like squats, deadlifts, and presses, is key to stimulating muscle growth and strength. Consuming enough protein to support muscle repair and growth, along with a balanced diet of healthy fats, complex carbohydrates, and essential vitamins and minerals, is essential. Additionally, allowing time for rest and recovery, including quality sleep, supports muscle repair and overall health.\n\n\n\nStrength Training: Engage in resistance training 2-3 times per week focusing on major muscle groups. Use weights, resistance bands, or bodyweight exercises. Compound exercises that work multiple muscle groups at once are most effective for muscle growth.12\nNutrition: Eat sufficient protein from sources like lean meats, fish, eggs, dairy, legumes, and plant-based proteins. Balancing your diet with enough calories, especially after workouts, helps muscle recovery and growth. A moderate calorie surplus supports sustainable muscle gain without excess fat.34\nRest and Recovery: Muscle grows during rest, so getting 7-9 hours of quality sleep nightly and spacing strength sessions allows muscles to repair and grow stronger.56\nConsistency and Challenging Workouts: Regular, progressively challenging resistance training causes muscle adaptation and growth. Training heavy with lower repetitions for strength and including higher repetitions for hypertrophy is a good balance.78\n\n\n\n\n\nIncreasing muscle strength and mass improves metabolism, cardiovascular health, mobility, balance, and physical independence, all contributing to longevity and a better quality of life.910\nStrength training also reduces risks related to chronic diseases, injury, and mental health decline.1112\nStudies show that strength training for even 90 minutes a week can slow biological aging and potentially add years to life.13\n\nIn summary, growing muscle through tailored strength training, proper protein intake, balanced nutrition, and sufficient rest promotes better health, reduces aging impacts, and supports a longer, more independent life.Growing muscle for a longer, better life involves regularly doing strength training exercises, eating enough protein and calories, and allowing your muscles time to recover. Focus on resistance training that targets major muscle groups, especially compound movements like squats, deadlifts, and presses. Consume a balanced diet rich in protein, healthy fats, and carbohydrates to support muscle repair and growth. Prioritize rest and get quality sleep for optimal recovery.141516\nKey points to build muscle and improve life:\n\nDo strength training at least 2-3 times per week with compound exercises.\nEat sufficient protein from lean meats, fish, eggs, dairy, legumes, or plant-based sources.\nMaintain a slight calorie surplus to fuel muscle growth.\nGet 7-9 hours of quality sleep and allow recovery between workouts.\nConsistency and progressively challenging workouts are essential for muscle gain.\n\nBuilding muscle improves metabolism, heart health, mobility, balance, and reduces risks of chronic diseases and injury, which all contribute to living longer and healthier. Even 90 minutes of strength training weekly can slow aging and add years of life.\nThis combination leads to better physical and mental wellbeing, enhanced independence, and increased longevity.1718192021 222324252627282930313233\n\n⁂"

    "title": "Finetuning",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Finetuning is a process of adapting a model to a specific task by further training the whole model or part of the model. It is one of the three very common AI engineering techniques used to adapt a model to specific needs, alongside prompt engineering and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). While prompt-based methods like prompt engineering and RAG influence a model’s quality solely through inputs without modifying the model itself, finetuning adapts a model by adjusting its weights. Finetuning techniques are generally more complicated and require more data compared to prompt-based methods. However, they can significantly improve a model’s quality, latency, and cost. Adapting a model by changing its weights makes things possible that aren’t otherwise, such as adapting it to a new task it wasn’t exposed to during initial training.\nFinetuning is considered part of a model’s training process, specifically an extension of model pre-training. Training that happens after pre-training is referred to as finetuning, and it can take various forms. Chapter 2 discusses two types of finetuning: supervised finetuning and preference finetuning.\nThe goal of finetuning is to get a base model, which has some but not all of the necessary capabilities, to perform well enough for a specific task. Finetuning improves sample efficiency, meaning a model can learn the desired behavior with fewer examples than training from scratch. For instance, while training a model for legal question answering from scratch might require millions of examples, finetuning a good base model might only require a few hundred. Finetuning can enhance various aspects of a model, including its domain-specific capabilities (like coding or medical question answering) and safety, but it is most often used to improve the model’s instruction-following ability, especially to adhere to specific output styles and formats.\n\n1. When to Finetune:\n\nEnhancing domain-specific capabilities: If a model struggles with a specific domain (e.g., a less common SQL dialect or customer-specific queries), finetuning on relevant data can help.\nImproving instruction following and structured outputs: Finetuning is the most effective and general approach to get models to generate outputs in a desired format. While prompting is less reliable, finetuning a model on examples following the desired format is much more reliable. For certain tasks like classification, modifying the model’s architecture before finetuning by adding a classifier head can guarantee the output format.\nBias mitigation: Finetuning with carefully curated data can counteract biases present in the base model’s training data. For example, finetuning on data with female CEOs or texts authored by women/African authors can reduce gender and racial biases.\nDistillation: Finetuning a smaller model to imitate the behavior of a larger model using data generated by the larger model is a common approach called distillation. This makes the smaller model cheaper and faster to use in production.\nOptimizing token usage (historically): Before prompt caching, finetuning could help optimize token usage by training the model on examples instead of including them in every prompt, resulting in shorter, cheaper, and lower-latency prompts. Although prompt caching has reduced this benefit, finetuning still removes the limitation of context length on the number of examples used.\nExtending context length: Long-context finetuning requires modifying the model’s architecture and can increase the maximum context length, though it is harder to do and the resulting model might degrade on shorter sequences.\n\n\n\n2. Reasons Not to Finetune:\n\nPerformance degradation on other tasks: Finetuning for a specific task can sometimes degrade performance on other tasks.\nHigh up-front investment and continual maintenance: Finetuning requires significant resources, including acquiring high-quality annotated data (which can be slow and expensive) and ML knowledge to evaluate base models, monitor training, and debug.\nServing complexity: Once finetuned, serving the model requires figuring out hosting (in-house or API) and inference optimization, which is non-trivial for large models.\nPace of base model improvement: New base models are constantly being developed and may improve faster than a finetuned model can be updated.\nPrompting might be sufficient: Many practitioners find that after complaints about prompting’s ineffectiveness, refining the prompt experiment process shows that prompting alone can be sufficient."

    "title": "Image classification",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This is the task of assigning an input image one label from a fixed categories. This is one of the core problems in Computer Vision that, despite its simplicity, has a large variety of practical applications. Moreover, many other seemingly distinct CV tasks (such as object detection, segmentation) can be reduced to image classification.\nExample: In the image blow in image classification model takes a single image and assigns probabilities to 4 label {cat, dog, hat, mug}. Computer view a image as an one large 3-dimensional array of numbers. In this example, the cat image is 248 pixel wide, 400 pixel tall, and has three color channel Red, Green, Blue. Therefore, the image consists of \\(248 \\times 400 \\times 3\\) numbers, or a total of 297,600 numbers. Each number is an integer that ranges from 0 (black) to 255 (white). Our task is turn this quarter of a million numbers into a single label, such as “cat”. \nChallenges: Since this task of recognizing a visual concept (e.g. cat) is relatively trivial for human to perform, it is worth considering the challenges involved from the perspective of a CV algorithm. As we present list of challenges below.\n\nViewpoint variation: A single instance of an object can be oriented in many ways with respect to the camera.\nScale variation: Visual classes often exhibit variation of their size (size in the real world, not only in terms of their extent in the image)\nDeformation: Many objects of interest are not rigid bodies and can be deformed in extremes ways.\nOcclusion: The objects of interest can be occluded. Sometimes only a small portion of an object (as little as few pixels) could be visible.\nIllumination conditions: The effect of illumination are drastic on the pixel level.\nBackground clutter: The objects of interest may blend into their environment, making them hard to identify.\nIntra-class variation: The classes of interest can be often be relatively broad, such as chair. Their are many different types of these objects, each with their own appearance. \n\nA good image classification model must be invariant to the cross product of all these variations, while simultaneously retaining sensitivity to the inter-class variations.\n\nCross product of variations This refers to the combination of all possible variations (e.g. viewpoint, scale, deformation, occlusion, illumination, etc.) that can occur within a class. The term “cross production” here is metaphorical, inpsired by the mathematical concept of a Cartesian product, which generate all possible combinations of elements from multiple sets.\n\nExample: A chair might appear:\n\nRotate (viewpoint variation)\nPartially hidden (occlusion)\nUnder bright sunlight (illumination)\nWhile being non-rigid (deformation) The model must recognize it as a “chair” despite this complex combination of variations Invariance Requirement: The model must be invariant to these variations, meaning its prediction for a class should not change even when factors alter the object’s appearance.\n\n\nInter-class variation There are difference between distinct classes (e.g. chairs vs tables). A model must retain sensitivity to these differences to avoid confusing classes, even when they share superficial similarities.\n\nExample: A “stool” (class: chair) and a “small table” (class: table) might both appear at similar scales or under similar lighting. The model must distinguish them based on defining feature (e.g. height, presence of a backrest).\nSensitivity Requirement: The model must preserver discriminate features that separate classes, even when intra-class variations (e.g. deformation in chairs) are extreme. Data-driven approach: How might we go about writing an algorithm that can classify images into distinct categories? Unlike writing an algorithm for, for example, sorting a list of numbers, it is not obvious how one might write an algorithm for identifying cats in images. Therefore, instead of trying to specify what every one of the categories of interest look like directly in code, the approach that we will take is not unlike one we would take with a child: we’re going to provide the computer with many examples of each class and then develop learning algorithms that look at these examples and learn about the visual appearance of each class. This approach is referred to as a data-driven approach, since it relies on first accumulating a training dataset of labeled images. Here is an example of what such a dataset might look like:\n\n\n\nThe image classification pipeline We’ve seen that the task in Image Classification is to taken an array of pixels that represents a single image and assign a label to it. Our complete pipeline can be formalized as follows: - Input: Our input consists of a set of N images, each labeled with one of K different classes. We refer to this data as the learning set. - Learning: Our task is to use the training set to learn what every one of the classes looks like. We refer to this step as training a classifier, or learning a model. - Evaluation: In the end, we evaluate the quality of the classifier by asking it to predict labels for a new set of images that it has never seen before. We will then compare the true labels of these images to the ones predicted by the classifier. Intuitively, we’re hoping that a lot of the predictions match up with the true answers (which we call the ground truth)."

Looking from an overall perspective, it is readily apparent that participants for all activities increased to varying degrees except in terms of martial arts and amateur drama. Film club was by far the most popular activity throughout, though table tennis demonstrated the strongest growth.\nIn 2000, 64 individuals participated in the film club, a figure that dipped to 60 in 2010 and then more than recovered to finish the period at 65. The trend for martial arts was similarly stable with a beginning data point of 38, a high of 39 in 2010, and a final figure of 37.\nThe remaining activities started the period lower with 27 participants for amateur drama, 18 for table tennis, and 0 for musical performances (unavailable at the time). Over the next 10 years, amateur dramatics commenced a decline that would end at just 5 by 2020, while table tennis underwent the inverse transformation, peaking at 52 by the same year. Musical performances were only an option starting in 2005, with participants growing and leveling off to just under 20 by the end of the period."

In 2006, approximately 900,000 new houses were built in the South, while the West recorded about 450,000. These figures fell significantly by 2008, reaching 450,000 and 200,000 respectively. Between 2008 and 2010, the decline continued, though more gradually, with the numbers dropping to 300,000 in the South and 150,000 in the West. However, by 2012, there was a slight increase, with around 310,00 homes constructed in the South and 160,000 in the West.\n\n\n2 Higher band version\nBetween 2006 and 2012, the number of new residential constructions in both the South and the West declined overall, though with minor fluctuations. In 2006, the South recorded approximately 900,000 new homes, while the West saw about half that figure at 450,000. By 2008, these numbers had dropped significantly to 450,000 in the South and 200,000 in the West. The downward trend continued more gradually over the next two years, reaching 300,000 and 150,00 respectively by 2010. However, 2012 saw a slight recovery, with new constructions rising modestly to around 310,000 in the South and 160,000 in the West.\n\nThe number of visitors to Dover increases overall throughout the year. In Spring, Dover recorded approximately 5,000 tourists. The Summer experiences a sharp climb to two times the figure of the before season.

In contrast, only 10% of men choose Humanities, while this subject attracted 30% of women, three times higher. Similarly, Education accounted for 35% of female enrollment, compared to just 20% of men.\n🔍 Detailed Analysis\n🟦 1. Task Achievement (Band 7–8)\n✅ You cover key features and specific numbers.\n✅ You make comparisons between male and female enrollment.\n❌ Minor inconsistency in the final sentence — it’s Education that had 35% of women and 20% of men, which you got right, but the word “just” is too informal here.\n🟨 2. Coherence & Cohesion (Band 7)\n✅ Clear overall structure and logical flow: from Engineering → Humanities → Education.\n❌ “three times higher” is vague. It’s better to say: “three times the proportion” or “threefold that of men.”\n❌ Avoid “similarly” unless the comparison is parallel — Education and Humanities are different in structure.\n🟥 3. Lexical Resource (Band 7)\n✅ Good use of: comprising, proportion, attracted, accounted for.\n❌ Could vary with more formal phrases like:\n“enrolled in” instead of “choose”\n“constituted” instead of “accounted for”\n🟩 4. Grammatical Range & Accuracy (Band 7)\n✅ Mostly correct grammar and comparatives.\n❌ “Choose” → should be past tense: chose (as you’re describing a chart, not a general truth)\n❌ Minor article omission: “more than twice the proportion…”\nRewrite: Engineering was the most popular subject among male students, accounting for 45% of their total enrollment, which was more than twice the proportion of females in the same field (20%). In contrast, only 10% of men chose Humanities, compared to 30% of women - three times the male figure. Likewise, Education attracted 35% of female students, while just 20% of male students enrolled in this subject."

    "text": "Some people think that charity organizations should only offer help to people of their own country. But others believe that these organizations should give aid to people in great need wherever they live. Discuss both views and give your opinion.\n\nCharitable organizations play an important role in supporting those in need, but there is debate about whether their assistance should be limited to people in their own country or extended across borders. While some argue that national responsibility must come first, others believe that aid should be based on human need rather than geography.\nThere is debate about whether charity organizations should limit their assistance to people in their own country or provide help to those in need regardless of location. While both sides present convincing arguments, I believe charities should not restrict their efforts by national borders.\nThere is ongoing debate about whether charity organizations should focus only on supporting people in their own country or whether they should extend their help to those in need abroad. While both perspectives have strong arguments, I believe the most effective approach is to provide assistance wherever it is most urgently required.\nOne reason some people argue that charities should concentrate on their own citizens is the issue of limited resources. Most charities depend on donations, which are rarely enough to address every problem. By focusing on national issues such as poverty, homelessness, or healthcare, these organizations can ensure that urgent needs at home are met. Furthermore, donors may feel more motivated to contribute if they know their money directly benefits their local community, which strengthens long-term support for these charities.\nOn the other hand, many believe that charity should not be restricted by geography. Natural disasters, famine, or war can create crises where entire populations are at risk, and local governments may lack the capacity to cope. In such circumstances, international charities are often the only organizations able to deliver essential aid like food, medicine, and shelter. Moreover, in today’s interconnected world, problems in one country - such as pandemics or climate change - can easily affect others, making international assistance not only compassions but also practical.\nIn my view, although it is reasonable for charities to prioritize local issues, they should not limit themselves entirely to national concerns. A balanced approach is most effective: dedicating part of their resources to domestic needs while also responding to international emergencies ensures that help reaches people in the greatest need, regardless of where they live.\nIn conclusion, while there are clear benefits to focusing on domestic problems, there also compelling reasons for providing international aid. Therefore, I believe charities should aim to strike a balance between supporting their local communities and offering help to people overseas who are facing severe hardship."

    "text": "In recent years, there has been a rise in the use of performance-enhancing substances in sports. What are the consequences of doping for athletes? What measures should be taken to combat this issue?\nThere has been a considerable rise in detections for performance-enhancing substances in athletic competitions recently. In my opinion, the most likely consequences for athletes concern their careers and this infraction is best tackled through more sophisticated screening tests.\nIn the majority of cases, athletes risk lasting career repercussions when caught doping. The first and most obvious consequences are financial. An athlete who tests positive for a banned substance will certainly be banned for a defined amount of time, potentially permanently in serious cases, and will forfeit salary and prize money over this period. Beyond raw salary, most athletes receive endorsements and a worsening public image will undoubtedly damage those business relationships as well. Relatedly, an athlete’s legacy is also at stake. A well-known example of this would be the baseball player Barry Bonds who not only lost the final years of an illustrious career to suspensions but has also not been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame due to his past transgressions and numerous failed tests.\nIn order to combat the pervasiveness of performance-enhancing drugs, sporting authorities must invest in modernized testing procedures. The most complex testing is currently utilized in the Olympics, however there are flaws in this system as it is often compromised by corruption and the equally sophisticated doping methods of certain nations. A more pertinent case of study would be in sports such as boxing and MMA where testing can literally mean the difference between life and death. In boxing, athletes often agree to their own testing procedures contractually. This method is inferior to vesting power in an authority, such as the UFC, that can ensure tests are modern and fairly conducted. Most UFC athletes are tested at random points throughout the year as well as prior to and immediately after bouts. Applying such a policy across various sports would not only catch the bast majority of infractions but also, more importantly, deter abuse even beginning.\nIn conclusion, athletes risk reputational and financial damage by doping and this can be prevented as testing becomes more comprehensive and potent. These measures are necessary to safeguard the integrity of sporting competitions around the world.\n\nIn recent years, the use of performance-enhancing drugs in sports has increased, posing significant challenges to fair competition. Doping not only harm an athlete’s career and finances but also damages the trust between fans, sponsors, and sporting institutions. I firmly believe that to protect the integrity of sports, it is essential to implement more advanced and transparent testing procedures.\nAthletes who resort to doping face serious long-term consequences that extend beyond temporary suspensions. When an athletes tests positive for banned substances, they risk losing salaries, prize money, and lucrative endorsements. For example, a renowned baseball player might be suspended, causing them to forfeit not only their immediate earnings but also potential future opportunities, such as Hall of Fame induction. This example clearly shows that doping can irreversibly tarnish an athlete’s legacy and career, leading to both financial ruin and a permanent stain on their reputation.\nTo effectively counter the issue of doping, sports authorities must adopt modern, comprehensive testing protocols. While major competitions like the Olympics employ advanced testing, the current is sometimes undermined by corruption and the ever-evolving sophistication of doping techniques. In sports like boxing and mixed martial arts, for instance, some athletes are subjected to self-regulated tests and lack objectivity. In contrast, organizations such as the UFC implement rigorous, random testing both before and after events, ensuring a fairer system. Adopting these strict measures across all sports would not only detect infractions more reliably but also serve as a strong deterrent against doping. By ensuring that testing is both modern and impartial, the integrity of competitive sports can be maintained, safeguarding athletes’ careers and reputation of the sport.\nIn conclusion, doping leads to severe financial and reputational damage for athletes while undermining the fairness of sports competitions. Only through the implementation of advanced, transparent testing procedures can we hope to deter doping and preserve the true spirit of sportsmanship for future generations.\n\nVocabulary\nFor extra practice, write an antonym (opposite word) on a piece of paper to help you remember the new vocabulary: 1. There has been a considerable rise in detections - There has been a significant increase in identifications 2. performance-enhancing substances - performance-boosting substances 3. athletic competitions - sporting events 4. most likely consequences for - probable outcomes for"

    "section": "",
    "text": "International air travel has a negative impact upon the environment and should therefore be restricted. Do you agree or disagree?\n\nIn recent years, some argue that international air travel should be curtailed due to its detrimental effect on the environment. However, I totally disagree with this idea, as restricting global flights would not only hinder economic growth but also undermine culture exchange.\nOn the economic front, air transport plays a pivotal role in facilitating tourism and trade, which are indispensable drivers of prosperity. For example, nations such as Thailand or Spain rely heavily on international visitors, and limiting flights would deal a severe blow to their hospitality industries. Moreover, multinational companies depend on global mobility to conduct business, attend meetings, and negotiate contracts. Without air travel, the interconnected nature of the global economy would collapse, creating ripple effects on employment and living standards worldwide.\nEqually important is the cultural dimension. Air travel allows people from different continents to meet, share, and foster mutual understanding. This cross-cultural interaction broadens people’s horizons and reduces prejudices, ultimately paving the way for a more harmonious world. If flights were restricted, such opportunities would vanish, leaving societies increasingly insular and intolerant. Although environmental concerns are legitimate, governments should prioritize sustainable aviation technologies such as biofuels and carbon offsetting instead of imposing blanket restrictions on flights.\nIn conclusion, restricting international air travel would do more harm than good, as it would jeopardize both global economies and cultural connectivity.\n\nIt is argued that international air travel damages the environment and should therefore be reduced. Although air transport is a source of pollution, I completely disagree that restricting flights is the right solution. This is because global mobility is essential in today’s world, and alternative measures can address the environmental challenges more effectively.\nFirstly, limiting international flights would create serious social and economic problems. Air travel allows people to study abroad, expand businesses, and maintain international relationships. Restricting this freedom would not only harm global trade and tourism but also prevent cultural exchange and educational opportunities. For instance, many students depend on international flights to pursue higher education in other countries, which would be impossible if travel were severely limited. Therefore, placing restrictions would have far-reaching negative consequences.\nSecondly, environmental issues caused by aviation can be addressed without banning or restricting flights. Governments and airlines are already investing in cleaner technology, such as more fuel-efficient engines and the development of sustainable aviation fuels. In addition, policies such as carbon offsetting and taxes on luxury or frequent travel can encourage responsible flying while still keeping it accessible. These strategies show that it is possible to reduce emissions without restricting international movement.\nIn conclusion, although air travel contributes to environmental problems, restricting it would cause more harm than good. A better solution is to continue supporting technological improvements and policies that make aviation more sustainable, while still allowing people to enjoy the benefits of international mobility."

    "text": "It is often argued that public libraries have become redundant due to the advancement of digital technologies that can fulfill the same purpose more efficiently. While computers and the internet have revolutionized the accessibility to information, I completely disagree that libraries are a waste of money; public libraries still play an irreplaceable social, educational, and cultural role.\nOn the one hand, it is undeniable that digital devices have transformed how people obtain and consume knowledge. With a single device, a person can have access to millions of books, academic journals, and databases, without having to leave the premises of their own house. This capacity has eliminated the practical need for public libraries, especially in more developed countries where widespread internet access is possible. Furthermore, maintaining libraries’ buildings, hiring staff, and updating archives require substantial public funding. These funds could be better invested in digital literacy programs or online resources that can reach a wider audience.\nOn the other hand, libraries continue to provide a unique value that technologies cannot replicate. First, they ensure equal access to knowledge for individuals who may not have the means to own a computer or to live in an area with sufficient internet coverage. For example, in many Central African countries, public libraries remain the only quiet and free spaces where students from disadvantaged communities can access educational materials. Moreover, public libraries foster social cohesion and intellectual culture through workshops, exhibitions, and nurturing a sense of a tight-knit community that can be hard to replicate in a large space like the internet. Finally, public libraries safeguard cultural heritage through the preservation of ancient manuscripts and scriptures, ensuring that future generations can access authentic historical materials beyond the digital space.\nIn conclusion, while digital devices have benefited the accessibility of knowledge, they cannot completely replace the functions and value of public libraries. Maintaining these archives is not a waste but a long-term investment into social equality, cultural preservation, and an intellectual community."

    "text": "It has been suggested that primary children should learn how to grow vegetables and keep animals.\nDo the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?\nDavid Lang’s essay:\nSome today have argued that it would be a sensible policy to teach children how to farm and raise animals at school. In my opinion, though this would require enormous resources, it would be beneficial in terms of both physical and intellectual development.\nThose arguing against this proposal point out the resources needed. In order to implement such an ambitious programs, schools would firstly need land nearby where animals and crops be raised. This might be possible within a school’s pre-existing grounds, but there would still need to be significant investment in infrastructure. Schools would therefore have to reallocate a significant portion of their budget, potentially reducing the money for crucial facilities, staff, and teaching resources.\nHowever, the advantages for the holistic development of children is overwhelming. Students today spend more time than ever before passively using technological devices. By spending more time outdoors learning about animals and crops, students will better understand their position within the natural food chain. Overtime, this may lead them to adopt environmentally friendlier, compassionate lifestyle choices such as becoming vegetarians or shopping locally rather than buying from large chains. Moreover, the work outdoors would necessarily involve physical exercise. Since obesity is a growing concern in most countries, this time outside could help to improve standards of physical fitness and establish healthy lifelong habits.\nIn conclusion, despite the money this reform would require, schools should adopt it when possible so as to achieve a more complete education for students. Governments should consider the long-term effects when deciding on such policies.\n\nChat gpt\nThe proposal to incorporate agricultural and animal husbandry education into primary school curricula has garnered attention. In my view, while such initiatives offer certain benefits, the potential drawbacks, particularly concerning resource allocation and health risks, are more significant.\nAdvocates highlight that engaging children in growing vegetables and caring for animals can foster responsibility and a connection to nature. These activities may enhance students’ understanding of food sources and promote environmental stewardship. However, implementing such programs requires substantial resources. Schools would need to invest in appropriate land, infrastructure, and trained personnel to oversee these activities. This financial commitment could divert funds from essential academic subjects, potentially compromising the quality of core education.\nMoreover, there are health and safety concerns associated with young children handling soil and animals. Exposure to allergens, zoonotic diseases, and physical injuries are risks that cannot be overlooked. Ensuring proper hygiene and safety measures would necessitate additional oversight and training, further straining school resources.\nIn conclusion, while teaching primary children to cultivate plants and care for animals has educational merits, the associated disadvantages, particularly in terms of resource allocation and health risks, outweigh the benefits. Schools should prioritize core academic subjects and consider integrating environmental education through less resource-intensive methods.\n💡 Why David Lang’s Essay Feels Simple but Scores High\n\nClear structure\n\nIntroduction: Directly paraphrases the question + gives a clear opinion.\nBody 1: Discusses the opposite view.\nBody 2: Presents his own view (which he supports).\nConclusion: Restates the opinion and wraps up.\n👉 Why it works: Examiners love clarity.

Disadvantages of Private Health Care: - High costs and Limited Accessibility: Private health care is expensive, making it inaccessible for low-income individuals who cannot afford quality treatment. - Profit-driven System: The focus on profit can sometimes lead to unnecessary medical procedures, overcharging, or prioritizing financial gain over patient well-being. - Health inequality: A reliance on private health care can widen the gap between the rich and the poor, as only those who can afford it receive top-tier medical services. ## Sample essay Health care is an essential service, yet private medical facilities often make it unaffordable for many individuals. While private health care offers significant advantages such as efficiency, superior technology, and greater patient choice, it also has considerable drawbacks, particularly its high costs and contribution to social inequality. In my view, although private health care enhances medical standards, its disadvantages outweigh its benefits due to its exclusive and financial burden on ordinary citizens.\nOne of the key benefits of private health care is it efficiency. Unlike public hospitals, which often suffer from overcrowding and long waiting times, private institutions provide quicker access to medical attention. This is particularly crucial for emergency treatments or specialized procedures that require immediate intervention. Additionally, private hospitals invest heavily in advanced medical technology and modern infrastructure, ensuring high-quality treatment and specialized care. For instance, many private institutions offer robotic surgeries and personalized cancer treatments, which are not always available in public hospitals. Furthermore, private health care allows patients to choose their doctors and treatment plans, leading to a more personalized and comfortable experience.\nHowever, the drawbacks of private health care are significant. The most pressing concern is its exorbitant cost, making it unaffordable for a large portion of the population. Many life-saving procedures and medications are out of reach for lower-income individuals, forcing them to rely on overstretched public health systems. Furthermore, because private hospitals overate on a profit-driven model, there is a risk of unnecessary procedures being performed to maximize revenue, sometimes at the expensive of patient welfare. Lastly, the presence of an expensive private health care sector creates a divide between the wealthy and the poor, exacerbating health inequalities. In countries without strong public health care, the underprivileged often suffer from preventable diseases simply due to financial constraints.\nIn conclusion, while private health care provides high-quality services and efficiency, its high costs and potential for exploitation make it a less viable option for the general population. A well-functioning public health system remains crucial to ensuring that medical care is accessible to all, regardless of financial status. Governments should regulate private health care costs and prioritize investment in public health services to balance quality with accessibility."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Every year, several languages die out. Some people think that this is not important because life will be easier if there are fewer languages in the world.\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?\nIt is helpful to turn the statement in the task into a question. In this case, we could see this as two separate questions:\n\nIs it important that languages are dying out every year?\nDoes having fewer languages make it easier?\n\n\nTo answer these question, we will need to discuss the impact that the loss of languages has. Clearly, it will affect the people whose language is dying out. However, the opinion in the question is about the impact this has on the world in general : ‘life will be easier (for everyone) if there are fewer languages in the world’. Therefore, the focus in this question is on both one specific group (the people losing their language) and the world at large (everyone else).\nThe ideas we have for this task are more likely to be based on abstract themes. Concrete themes, such as money, food, or socializing are often easier to write or talk about. More abstract ideas, such as ‘life’, ‘society’, and ‘culture’ are more difficult to discuss, which adds another level of difficulty to this task. If we have an abstract topic, visualization techniques can help us to see more concrete ideas within the topic that then will help us to write about it.\nThe question tells us that, ‘Some people think that (the loss of language) is not important’. In other words, we are being told about an attitude or reaction to something, and we will need to discuss this attitude in our essay. We are also told these people think that ‘life will be easier’ without these language, so they are also commenting on the effect or impact that this will have. Thus, again, we need to consider cause and effect in this essay.\n\n\n1 Planner\nIntroduction General topic Disappearing language\nFocus: people in remote areas + people in general\nIssue to discuss: is it important that languages are dying out? Does it make life easier?\nMy initial position: I completely disagree - yes, it is important\nThemes: Language, culture, changing world, people, communication\nSide A: Life is easier / the loss is unimportant\nMain topic of this paragraph: How life is made easier (benefits of loss)\n1 Language - use it every day - business communication and travel -&gt; transactions easier if people understand each other + problems can be solved faster\n2 culture - can understand the culture -&gt; x\n3 Changing world =\nchanges to language are inevitable (more travel, more international business -&gt; need to communicate more)\n4 people - easier for business people and travellers\nWhat did i show or prove? link to the question? Easier for certain people / situations - loss is inevitable\nSide B: The loss is important\nMain topic of this paragraph\nThe negative effects of this loss\n1 Language - Yes, business is easier, BUT language is used for more than this e.g. express feelings + culture + history\n2 Culture - language used to express culture (poems, literature, history = adds variety / makes the world richer)\n= part of identity of individuals and community\n3 People - -&gt; for the people involved this is a big loss + for the world, this is a big loss\nWhat prove\nSome people are far more affected by the loss than others\nConclusion - Summary of my main points:\nYes, it makes business easier but language adds variety and makes the world richer.\nQuestion to answer: To what extent do you agree / disagree?\nMy final position: I completely disagree\nIn some parts of the world, native languages are being lost as societies develop and evolve. Some believe that this is unimportant and even see it as an advantage. This essay will discuss whether the loss of such languages should be cause for concern.\nIt is true that many aspects of modern day life are made easier through sharing a common language. First and foremost, business transactions are much simpler when the two parties concerned can understand each other well. Travel problems can also be dealt with much faster when there is mutual understanding. Thanks to globalization, these types of communication are increasing, and this could be seen as largely responsible for the disappearance of languages in more remote areas. If people in those areas work in tourism, or international trade, they must adopt the more widely used languages of the world. Thus, with each new generation, their native tongue becomes both less useful and less used. Sadly, the desire to make life simpler makes the loss of some languages inevitable.\nNevertheless, this inevitability does not mean the loss is insignificant. Language has a multitude of uses that go far beyond tourism and business communication. Our native tongue is used to express our deepest feelings and emotions, which are much more difficult to convey when using a second language. Language also plays an important part in our culture and identity, uniting us as a community. Thus, when a language is lost, part of the community and culture also disappears. This must be an enormous loss for the people concerned.\nIn conclusion, while it is true that having fewer languages benefits the world of business, and makes transactions easier, I completely disagree with the view that the continued loss of languages is unimportant. The variety of native languages and cultures is what makes the world a richer place, and any loss of this kind should not be dismissed lightly."

When you hear collect / analyse, expect a non-count / abstract noun (data / information / evidence) rather than a concrete species name. Train yourself to listen one or two words after the verb phrase to catch the direct object."

If the speaker uses a sense of …, the missing word is usually an abstract state (freedom, independence, belonging). Also, when you hear the pattern “I would imagine they get a sense of …”, slow down in your head and expect one concrete abstract noun — not a gerund or verbal noun derived from the previous sentence."

If the context allows more than one, answer must be plural. For summary completion always re-read the sentence mentally with your candidate word: does it fit grammatically?"

    "text": "Due to television and the internet it is easier today for a large number of people to become famous. Is this a positive or negative development?\nDavid Lang;\nIt is easier than ever today for people to become famous because of increased channels for distribution such as television and the internet. This is clearly a positive trend as it opens up the entertainment industry to greater diversity.\nThose who decry this trend typically to talentless celebrities. In the past, a comedian or musician might work for years honing their craft in order to get a slot on one of the few talkshows and then become famous overnight. Nowadays, many celebrities start on reality TV or a YouTube channel and do not have any discernible talents. The socialite Paris Hilton was one of the first to take advantage of her wealth who through dating celebrities and canny use of social media and television was able to become a celebrity in her own right.\nDespite the aforementioned cases, this is on a whole a positive trend because of the more diverse range of famous people today. Fame used to be the prerogative of white men and women, with the occasional exception from an ethnic group. One of the reasons for this is that whites typically come from more privileged backgrounds and have greater opportunities, thereby making up a disproportionate share of success stories. The internet in particular has leveled the playing field to an extent. Anyone with a smartphone today has the ability to broadcast their talents and cultivate a loyal fanbase, regardless of gender or ethnicity and without the barriers that existed in the past such as ingrained reluctance from authority figures to give certain ethnicities an honest chance.\nIn conclusion, there are clear cultural drawbacks to the ease with which many achieve fame but today it is nonetheless more inclusive. A greater concern should be the age at which people become famous as it can have developmental side effects.\nChatGPT:\nIn today’s digital age, becoming famous is easier than ever due to the explosion of online platforms and television opportunities. While some see this as a democratization of fame, it is, in reality, a negative development that has diminished the value of talent, effort, and cultural depth.\nFame today is often disconnected from genuine ability. In the past, achieving celebrity status typically required years of dedication to a particular craft. A musician, for instance, might have spent decades perfecting their skills before getting a rare shot on a major talk show. This long road filtered out the mediocre and ensured that fame reflected a certain level of excellence. By contrast, many modern celebrities rise to prominence through reality TV or social media, sometimes without any identifiable talent. Paris hilton is prime example, became a household name not because of any specific talent, but because of her social status and media presence. Similarly, Kim Kardashian built a brand through strategic use of television and social media, not through traditional artistic or professional success.\nThis shift also sends a harmful message to younger generations: that fame can be achieved without effort or substance. As a result, more people may value visibility over personal development or hard work. In previous decades, fame was generally linked to expertise or originality - actors, musicians, writers, and athletes were admired for what they did, not just who they were. Today, however, social media influencers can gain millions of followers by simply being entertaining or attractive online. This can create unrealistic aspirations and encourage superficiality. Furthermore, the psychological impact of sudden fame, especially among young people, cannot be ignored. Many find themselves under intense pressure to maintain their online image, which can lead to mental health challenges such as anxiety, stress, and loss of identity.\nIn conclusion, although more people now have the opportunity to become famous, the way fame is achieved today often undermines the importance of talent, discipline, and meaningful contribution. This is a negative development that not only lowers cultural standards but also risks harming individuals who are unprepared for the realities of public life. Rather than celebrating fame for its own sake, society should place more value on substance and long-term achievement.\n\n\nIn today’s digital age, becoming famous is easier than ever due to the explosion of online platforms and television opportunities.

    "text": "In today’s digital age, becoming famous is easier than ever due to the explosion of online platforms and television opportunities. While some see this as a democratization of fame, it is, in reality, a negative development that has diminished the value of talent, effort, and cultural depth.\nFame today is often disconnected from genuine ability. In the past, achieving celebrity status typically required years of dedication to a particular craft. A musician, for instance, might have spent decades perfecting their skills before getting a rare shot on a major talk show. This long road filtered out the mediocre and ensured that fame reflected a certain level of excellence. By contrast, many modern celebrities rise to prominence through reality TV or social media, sometimes without any identifiable talent. Paris Hilton is a prime example, becoming a household name not because of any specific talent, but because of her social status and media presence. Similarly, Kim Kardashian built a brand through strategic use of television and social media, not through traditional artistic or professional success.\nThis shift also sends a harmful message to younger generations: that fame can be achieved without effort or substance. As a result, more people may value visibility over personal development or hard work. In previous decades, fame was generally linked to expertise or originality — actors, musicians, writers, and athletes were admired for what they did, not just who they were. Today, however, social media influencers can gain millions of followers by simply being entertaining or attractive online. This can create unrealistic aspirations and encourage superficiality. Furthermore, the psychological impact of sudden fame, especially among young people, cannot be ignored. Many find themselves under intense pressure to maintain their online image, which can lead to mental health challenges such as anxiety, stress, and loss of identity.\nIn conclusion, although more people now have the opportunity to become famous, the way fame is achieved today often undermines the importance of talent, discipline, and meaningful contribution. This is a negative development that not only lowers cultural standards but also risks harming individuals who are unprepared for the realities of public life. Rather than celebrating fame for its own sake, society should place more value on substance and long-term achievement."

Supporting evidence helps the reader to understand our main argument and shows our thinking, but attempts to do this cause problems even at Band 7, where candidates may ‘overgeneralize and/or supporting ideas may lack focus’. Only at band 8 are main ideas ‘relevant, extended and supported’ and it is not until band 9 that they are ‘fully extended and well-supported.’ Clearly, providing relevant, focused support for our argument is a high-level skill.\nThe fact that supporting evidence is not mentioned at band 6 and below is often interpreted to mean that ‘you must include examples to score band 7’. While this is true to a certain extent, the way in which this is done often continues to result in a score of band 6 or 6.5, which shows there is a problem with this advice."

    "text": "2.1 Problem 1: Template filling and invented examples\nIn most of the band 6 essays, each paragraph contains a separate sentence with an example. There are often invented statistics that sound odd, and they rarely help to explain or support the main idea in the paragraph. Such examples are provided mechanically, often at the very end of the paragraph, as though the writer is thinking, ‘now I need to write an example’, rather than, ‘how can I prove this point?’\nThe following paragraphs was written by a native speaker. The essays was about helping older workers to get a job. Do you think the example (in bold) supports or explains the main idea?\nTo tackle this long-term problem, governments should provide a corporate tax incentive when they hire experienced people. That is to say that a lower income tax on the profits of companies would allow employers to hire the right people to perform the right job, without the need to lower HR fees. For example, a similar initiative was launched by the United States government in San Francisco, California, which has resulted in Tesla’s yearly corporate taxes to reduce by 35%.\nThere are some grammatical issues in this essay (native speakers often use patterns common in spoken language), but the main problems are with Coherence and cohesion and Task response: the main ideas are not adequately developed and remain confusing and unclear. How does lower income tax help companies to hire the right people? What is the relevance of lower HR fees? The example provided does not help the reader to understand any of these points, nor why the writer has concluded that ‘governments should provide a corporate tax incentive when they hire experienced staff’.\nThe second body paragraph also followed the same pattern: two sentences that are not logically connected followed by a very clearly invented example. The writer confirmed that he had been taught to use this same template approach in every essay. As a result, although the last sentence looks like an example, it does not perform the function of an example, because it doesn’t support, or help to explain, any of the previous ideas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAdding a sentence with an invented example will not provide supporting evidence for our ideas, or persuade the reader to believe them."

    "text": "2.2 Problem 2: Examples that are not examples\nIn many essays, the examples given are not examples at all - they are often simply a repetition of the previous idea:\nOn the other hand, if good transportation is provided to the public they will travel by public transport. For example, if fast metro trains are provided to people who go to work and students who go to school or colleges in the morning. In addition, if there are buses on different routes that cover all the important destinations, such as downtown, hospitals, schools, factories area. An example of this is, in London, people prefer to travel by bus because buses are fast and they go to famous places of the city.\nThis paragraph is another good examples of why a template approach will not work: there are cohesive device here (in bold) that have been used as a fixed framework for the paragraph, but they are not logically connected to the ideas in between. As a result, ideas are again presented as ‘examples’ but they do not perform this function: they do not help to explain or support the writer’s points or claims:\nWe map out these ideas to see the issue more clearly:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClaim\nExample given to show this claim reasonable\n\n\n\n\nif good transportation is provided to the public they will travel by public transport\nif fast metro trains are provided to people who go to work and students who go to school or colleges in the morning\n\n\nif there are buses on different routes that cover all the important destinations, such as downtown, hospitals, schools, factories area\nin London, people prefer to travel by buses because buses are fast and they go to famous places of the city\n\n\n\nAs we can see, the examples given do not support the claims being made. This shows that simply writing ‘For example, …’ or ‘An example of this is …’ at the start of a sentence is not enough. The ideas that follows these patterns must provide evidence to support the previous idea, like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf good public transportation is provided people will use it. For example, cities like London, Tokyo, and Singapore have excellent underground trains that are filled with people traveling to work, school or college every day. In addition, if there are buses on different routes that cover important destinations, such as hospitals and factories, these would also no doubt be used in preference to private cars, reducing traffic as a result.\n\n\nIn this version, the connecting phrases are used because they are needed, and because they fit this argument. As a result, they work as effective signposts, helping the reader to follow the development of the argument, and showing how the ideas are connected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you begin with a template of cohesive devices and then attempt to fill in the gaps between them, the result will be band 6 ‘mechanical’ use of these linking words and phrases. Remember - your ideas and your argument must come first."

This is because nowadays it is no longer necessary to buy a plane ticket and spend 5 hours to get to the US to buy a Zara handbag. In my experience, this mindset genuinely reflects human nature since many of us have a tendency to think about our own interests first.\n\n\nHe went on to the argue that:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOn the societal level, the results may be catastrophic if this is the case. Perhaps the worst-case scenario is that the global tourism industry may collapse.\n\n\nThe reasoning in this argument can be summarized as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis is a positive trend because it saves us time and money (e.g. we no longer need to fly to the US to buy a Zara handbag) = human nature = people think of our own interests first =&gt; the global tourism industry may collapse.\nMapping the ideas in this way shows the lack of logic in reaching this conclusion - the example does not support the conclusion that global tourism may collapse, and it is rather trivial in comparison.\n\n3 Other ways of supporting our ideas\nOur main ideas or points are often broad and general, while our supporting evidence is more specific.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThere are several reasons why the government collect taxes. Firstly, the money raised can be used to build new roads or public buildings. Secondly, existing infrastructure, such as schools and hospital, can be updated or repaired. Finally, these funds are needed to pay the salaries of all government workers, including firefighters and the police. Thus, taxes help improve the community while also making it safer.\n\n\nThe following image shows that we can categorize the ideas in this paragraph as either ‘general ideas’ or ‘supporting evidence’:\n\nWe can transfer this idea to help in the reading test: for matching headings questions, we need to identify the broader, more general idea within a paragraph or section of the passage.\n\n3.0.1 Practice\nRead through the paragraph and identify two ‘general ideas’ and three examples of ‘specific evidence’. :::{.callout-note} In many big cities, the population exceeds the number of flats and houses available, which means that many people do not have anywhere to live. This causes several problems. Firstly, it can put pressure on local charities, who have to find food and shelter for the homeless. If the government does not step in to help people who are struggling financially, then this puts even more stress on community programs and causes homelessness to rise even further. In addition, a lack of accommodation means that house prices and rents remain very high. Thus, housing problems have an impact on everyone in the community.\n\n\n\n\ngeneral ideas: many people do not have anywhere to live -&gt; cause several problems\n-&gt; housing problems have an impact on everyone in the community\nspecific evidence:\nput pressure on local charities\nlocal charities have to find food and shelter for the homeless\nlack of accommodation means that house prices and rents remain very high."

For example, if we are writing about the topic of ‘success’, we could begin by defining what this word means to us, or in our culture, which may be different to the examiner’s interpretation of the word.\nSometimes, we rephrase an idea in order to make it clearer.

(i.e. What does our example show?) If this is not relevant to our main idea then we should not use it.\nTry to decide if our problem is with the main ideas and points we are making, the examples we have used to support them, or a combination of the two."

Overall, the process comprises three main stages, which take place in different production areas.\nFirstly, in the factory, limestone, clay are crushed to have raw powder. To create a thinner texture, it will be mixed by the mixer before being heated and rotated simultaneously by the rotating heater. The powder then moves to the grinder and becomes cement. After that, cement will be stored in bags and will be ready to use.\nAt the construction site, with a relatively small percentage of cement (15%), sand and gravel are added by a large percentage, by 25% and 50% respectively, and a little water (10%). The mixture is added to a concrete mixer to produce concrete.\n\nQuestion (summary):\nThe diagrams show how cement is made and how concrete is produced.\n1.

Body Paragraph 2 – Concrete production\n\nFour ingredients: cement (15%), water (10%), sand (25%), gravel (50%).\nCombine in a concrete mixer → final product = concrete\n\nThe diagrams show the process of producing cement and how this is then used in the production of concrete for construction. Overall, cement production involves several stages that take place in a factory, while concrete is made by combining different materials in a mixer at the building site.\nIn the first stage of cement manufacture, limestone and clay are crushed together to form a powder. This mixture then passes through a mixer before entering a rotating heater, where it is simultaneously heated and mixed. The resulting substance is ground in a grinder to produce cement. The finished product is then packaged in bags for use.\nConcrete production, on the other hand, is a much simpler process. Four ingredients are combined in a concrete mixer: 15% cement, 10% water, 25% sand, and 50% gravel. These are throughly mixed together to form concrete, which can then be used in construction."

However, during the summer months, Troy saw a dramatic surge to 23,000 visitors, more than double Dover’s figures of 10,000. In autumn, while Troy has a slight decrease to 20,000 visitors, Dover hosts increasingly to 15,000 visitors.\nIn contrast, winter brought a complete reversal in patterns. Dover’s tourist numbers peaked at 25,000, while Troy experienced a steep decline, drawing only 5,000 visitors - the lowest for the year. This stark contrast highlights Dover’s strong winter appeal and Troy’s reliance on summer tourism."

Discuss both views and give your opinion.\nPlan\nIntroduction\nGeneral topic: Reading and literature\nFocus: Local vs international literature\nIssue to discuss: Should people read national or international works?\nPosition: While local literature is important, international literature has broader benefits\nThemes: culture, identity, personal development, education, global awareness\nSide A: Local literature is important\nMain topic of paragraph: Benefits of reading literature from your own country\n1 culture & identity - local stories reflect national history, traditions, values -&gt; helps develop sense of belonging\n2 Language skills - written in familiar language -&gt; easier comprehension and engagement\n3 Heritage & Knowledge - understanding historical events, local society -&gt; educates younger generations\nlink back: shows why reading local literature is valuable and necessary\nSide B international literature is important\nmain topic: benefits of reading literature from other countries\n1 cultural awareness & empathy - exposure to different ways of life, social issues, moral dilemmas\n2 critical thinking & creativity - compare different societies, challenge assumptions\n3 global perspective helps navigate an interconnected world, broadens horizons\nlink back: shows why international literature is increasingly important.\nconclusion\nsummary of main points: local literature promotes identity; international literature promotes understanding and critical thinking\nfinal position: balance is best - engage with both, but international exposure is essential for broader personal growth\nIn many countries, there is an ongoing debate about whether people should focus on reading books from their own nation or whether exploring international literature is more beneficial. While literature from one’s own country certainly has value, I believe that reading works from around the world provides wider benefits for personal development and understanding.\nIt is true that local literature plays an important role in preserving culture and identity. Stories written by authors from one’s own country often reflect national history, traditions, and social values. By reading these works, individuals gain a deeper understanding of their heritage, which can strengthen a sense of belonging and connection to their community. Moreover, local literature is usually written in a familiar language, which makes it easier for readers to engage with the content and appreciate the subtleties of style and expression. For younger generations, these books provide knowledge of historical events and societal norms, ensuring that important cultural lessons are not forgotten.\nNevertheless, reading international literature offers benefits that local works alone cannot provide. Exposure to stories from different countries allows readers to develop empathy and a broader understanding of diverse cultures. International literature can present social issues, moral dilemmas, and everyday experiences that are entirely different from one’s own, encouraging critical thinking and reflection. Additionally, such reading fosters creativity, as comparing different societies and styles challenges assumptions and expands the imagination. In today’s increasingly interconnected world, having a global perspective is essential, and international literature is an effective way to achieve this.\nIn conclusion, while books from one’s own country are valuable for preserving identity and cultural knowledge, reading international works offers a broader understanding of humanity and encourages personal growth. Therefore, I would argue that a balanced approach is ideal: people should read both local and global literature, but international exposure should play a central role in fostering a well-rounded worldview."

While many people are able to do this in their own country, some choose to travel aboard to help with their studies. There are advantages and disadvantages to this.\nThe disadvantages of doing a language course overseas are significant. Firstly, there is the cost to consider. As well as flights and tuition fees, money is needed for day-to-day expenses, such as food and accommodation. Indeed, it may be too expensive for many. In addition, living away from family and friends can lead to loneliness, and being surrounded by a strange new culture can increase this sense of isolation. Such problems can even be severe enough to interfere with learning, thus defeating the object of the trip.\nNevertheless, these issues can generally be resolved, and there are definite rewards to studying a language in the country where it is the mother tongue. Although it may be expensive, students can get a part-time job to help meet their needs. Through work and school, they can socialize and make friends, and are likely to feel less homesick as a result. Any new culture feels strange at first, but it is also exciting and creates a much richer language learning experience; for example, through being able to enjoy the literature and music of the country. Furthermore, the access to native speaker teachers, and the total immersion in the language means it is possible to reach a far higher level than in your home town. Clearly, there is a lot to be gained from an opportunity like this.\nTo sum up, although some may struggle to adapt to the new culture and deal with financial issues, those who overcome these problems will undoubtedly be enriched by this invaluable experience. Therefore, in my view, the potential benefits more than make up for any disadvantages."

English grammar requires plural nouns when talking about things in general: dogs are banned, not dog is banned.\n\nTip: Look for general statements about rules—these usually take the plural form.\n\n\n\n\n3.0.2 Q6: Walk across the sands and reach the …\n\nYou wrote: BEACH\nCorrect answer: ISLAND\nRecording clue:\n\nPeter: “We’ll be meeting in the car park at Dunsmore Beach at low tide – that’s when the sands are dry enough for us to walk to the island without getting wet.”\n\nWhy ISLAND?\n\nThe destination of the walk is the island, not the beach (the beach is just the starting point).\n\nTip: Pay attention to prepositions and verbs indicating direction, e.g., “walk to …” → destination is the answer.\n\n\n\n\n3.0.3 Q9: Making … out of wood\n\nYou wrote: SPOON\nCorrect answer: SPOONS\nRecording clue:\n\nPeter: “You’ll be starting with wooden spoons … anything you make is yours to take home with you.”\n\nWhy plural?\n\nThe participants can make more than one spoon, so the plural form is correct.\n\nTip: Listen for plural references in sentences like “anything you make” or “we keep the number … down,” which imply multiple items.\n\n\n✅ Summary of your error pattern:\n\nSingular vs plural: always check if the statement is general or multiple items.\nDestination vs starting point: listen carefully for “to” / “towards”.\nMinor spelling/plural errors can cost points—listen for context clues.\n\n\n\n\n4 Recording 2\n\n4.0.1 Q12: What colour are the tour boats?\n\nYou answered: A. dark red\nCorrect answer: C. light green\nRecording clue:\n\n“They used to be jet black, but our new ones now have these comfortable dark red seats and a light-green exterior in order to stand out from others …”\n\nWhy C is correct:\n\nThe seats are dark red, but the exterior (the main visible part of the boat) is light green.\nIELTS often tests attention to exact detail; don’t confuse interior features with overall appearance.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.0.2 Q13: Which lunchbox is suitable for someone who doesn’t eat meat or fish?\n\nYou answered: C. Lunchbox 3\nCorrect answer: B. Lunchbox 2\nRecording clue:\n\n“Lunchbox 1 contains ham and tomato sandwiches. Lunchbox 2 contains a Cheddar cheese roll and Lunchbox 3 is salad-based and also contains eggs and tuna.”\n\nWhy B is correct:\n\nA vegetarian would avoid meat and fish.\nLunchbox 2 contains Cheddar cheese (no meat, no fish) → suitable.\nLunchbox 3 contains tuna, which is fish → not vegetarian.\n\nTip: Always check all ingredients, not just the label like “salad-based.”\n\n\n✅ Key takeaways from these mistakes:\n\nDistinguish parts of objects (seats vs exterior).\nAlways read/listen carefully for hidden ingredients when identifying dietary suitability.\nDouble-check “contains” statements; first impressions may mislead. # Recording 3\n\n\n\n4.0.3 Q21: What problem did both Diana and Tim have when arranging their work experience?\n\nYou answered: (probably B or C)\nCorrect answer: A. making initial contact with suitable farms\nRecording clue:\n\nTim: “I found mine through a friend of my mother’s, but it wasn’t easy.”\nDiana: “finding the right sort of farm to apply to wasn’t easy.”\n\nWhy A is correct: Both struggled to find a farm and make initial contact.\nWhy B and C are wrong:\n\nTim mentions transport and length issues, but Diana’s main issue was finding the right farm. The shared problem is initial contact.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.0.4 Q24: What did the students learn about adding supplements to chicken feed?\n\nYou answered: B or C\nCorrect answer: A. These should only be given if specially needed\nRecording clue:\n\n“my farmer said some are overpriced… he didn’t give them as a matter of routine, just at times when the chickens seemed to particularly require them.”\n\nWhy A is correct: Supplements are not routine, only when required.\nWhy B/C are wrong:\n\nThe discussion did not mention effectiveness or limiting amounts; it focused on necessity.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.0.5 Q30: Wildlife medication\n\nYou answered: D. They were both surprised how little is known…\nCorrect answer: C. Diana may do some further study on this\nRecording clue:\n\nDiana: “I thought I might write my dissertation on something connected with that.”\n\nWhy C is correct: She may do further study, not that they were surprised.\nWhy D is wrong: Tim mentions being surprised in another module (animal disease), not wildlife medication.\n\n✅ Key takeaways:\n\nFocus on shared vs individual experiences when the question asks “both.”\nLook for explicit statements of opinion or intention (e.g., “I might write my dissertation…”).\nDon’t confuse examples of surprise with the module being asked about.\n\n\n\n\n5 Recording 4\nFor Q33, the correct answer is CONFUSION.\n\nText evidence:\n\n“The word ‘maze’ is believed to come from a Scandinavian word for a state of confusion.”\n\nWhy “CONFUSION” is correct: The passage explicitly links the origin of the word maze to confusion, not “amazing.”\nCommon mistake: Some might be misled by the text mentioning amazing, but that just explains the etymology of the English word amazing, not the meaning of maze."

(i.e. the context for this essay)\nWhat is the main issue or point that will be discussed in your essay?\nAlthough this is only a short paragraph, there are varying approaches to how to write it, which appear to cause quite a lot of confusion. Because of this, there are some recurring problems. The first three have one common thread: getting started.\n\n\n\nMany people are so keen to get started in their writing that they quickly skim read the test question. This can mean that they jump to a conclusion about what it means, or misinterpret it, and then misrepresent it in their introduction. The idea in their body paragraphs then move further and further away from the issue raised in the question, compounding the problem. Some candidates identify only the broad general topic within the question and write about this instead of the very specific issue they were asked to discuss.\n\n\n\nSome people tell, ‘I like to begin with a general statement’. The danger here is that these are so general that they do not seem relevant to the issue raised in the question. Others begin their essays in a very rehearsed way that is often not accurate. For example, ‘This is an often debated topic’. Or ‘This is a controversial topic’, when in fact the issue in the question is not a common topic of conversation, or is rather mundane.\n\n\n\nSome people begin an introduction with a ‘hook’, such as an interesting fact or statistic. Hooks are used by professional writers to grab the attention of the reader. Our examiner does not need to be persuaded to read our answer, and they do not need to be entertained by our writing. Even more importantly, a hook can seem out of place in a formal discursive essay, and they often seem irrelevant to the question.\n\n\n\nAlthough it is the first paragraph in our essay, our introduction should not be the starting point of our writing; we need to think carefully about the question, then think through and plan our whole argument first. We will never be asked to simply discuss a very broad topic such as ‘pollution’ or ‘technology’, so keep reading until we have fully understood exactly issue we are being asked to write about.\nPay particular attention to the words and phrases in the question that indicate the claim or argument that is being made, because this is what we must respond to in our answer to achieve a good Task response score. Typical words and phrases to look for are:\nshould, should always; should not; would be better; the only way; the best way, etc\nIf there are any words in the question we do not know, read the whole question again more slowly. Skilled test writers try to help us understand words or ideas, either by giving an example, or using paraphrase, so take the time to look for these clues. Look at the following example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSome people believe that parents should be responsible for teaching children right from wrong. Others think that schools should also teach children to behave well.\nDiscuss both these views and give your own opinion.\n\n\nSome candidates might not know the phrase ‘to teach right from wrong’, so the second sentence paraphrases this idea with ‘teaching children to behave well’, helping to explain it. This is done deliberately at the test writing stage, so make sure we use all of the help that is there in the question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nDon’t quickly skim read the question so that you can start writing as soon as possible. Take the time to read it carefully; identify the issue you must discuss and the argument you must respond to. Look for clues within the question to help you understand the meaning of key ideas.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur first sentence should introduce the broad topic and thus set the context for our essay. Although this is quite a general statement, it should still be relevant to the question and to our argument.\nAccurately identifying the general topic in the question is an important first step.\n\n\n\nHaving set the overall context in our first sentence, the next sentence will introduce the reader to the issue that is going to be discussed. Many people already know that you should avoid copying directly from the question, but then go too far by substituting each word with a synonym.\n\n\n\nAlthough it is true that we should not copy large parts of the question, this does not mean you have to avoid all of the words, which may have been used because they are the most appropriate or the most natural. For example, ‘Some people’ is the most natural way to talk about an anonymous group; we don’t use ‘Numerous individuals’ or ‘humans’, in the same way. Similarly, ‘teachers’ is a better word to use than ‘educational scholars’ and ‘children’ is more natural than ‘youths’.\nRather than translating the words in the question, aim to interpret the overall meaning as precisely as we can. It can sometimes help to change the statement we are given into a question. This has the additional advantage of making our task clearer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplete the following introduction to our essay question using these words and phrases\nat school, grow up, discipline, teach\nDiscipline is an important part of growing up. Some people believe that children should be taught how to behave at school, while others think this is the job of their parents.\nWhat common themes do you think you might write about in an essay about\none of the 4 general topics in the table below?\nLook at the following list of common themes and decide which of the general\ntopics in the table they match. Write the words and phrases in the appropriate\ncolumn.\nCommon themes:\naccommodation, curriculum, doctors, diet, entertainment, exercise, free time,\nfriends and family, food, going out, hospitals, holidays, medicine, money,\nnursing, pressure, resources, socialising, students, study, the arts, teachers,\nwork\n\n\n\nEducation\nLife / Living\nHealth\nEntertainment\n\n\n\n\nstudents\naccommodation\ndiet\ngoing out\n\n\ncurriculum\nfree time\ndoctors\nholiday\n\n\nstudents\nfriend and family\nexercise\nsocializing\n\n\nstudy\nmoney\nfood\nthe arts\n\n\nteacher\npressure\nhospitals\n\n\n\n\nresources\nmedicine\n\n\n\n\n\nnursing\n\n\n\n\nLook at the following list of opening sentences taken from essays discussing whether: ‘being a celebrity brings more benefits or more challenges’.\nDecide whether the sentences introduce the focus and the general topic of this essay well and identify any problems (You may need to select more than one box).

As you will see later, the phrase ‘fascinates many people’ introduces a theme that will occur later in the essay. ## Paraphrasing\n\n\n\n\nSolution\nIf you decide to include a thesis statement in your introduction, you need to:\nbe fully aware of your position and main argument before writing it\ngive only a brief overview of your thesis (in one sentence)\nmake sure your thesis accurately reflects the argument you will make in your body paragraphs\n\n\n\nSome candidates finish their introduction with a sentence that paraphrases the final question in the writing task. For example, ‘In this essay I will discuss these two views before giving my own opinion’. This copy the words in the task almost exactly, which is not a good idea. Others draw attention to the writing process in a different way: ‘I will now prove that…’. Again, this is unnecessary - your examiners knows why you are writing; In our introduction, they just want to learn what you are writing about.\nSolution\nDon’t paraphrase the question itself, only focus on the topic and the issue that will be discussed. Aim to write in a less personal way - keep the focus on your essay, not on yourself as the writer. For example, it is better to write: ‘This essay will discuss …’ instead of ‘In this essay I will discuss…’"

It’s here that demand is greatest. Obviously, there isn’t such demand in wealthier areas… or in the suburbs where there are usually more places for children to play outside.”\nKey phrases: “busy roads” and “demand is greatest.”\nInterpretation: “most needed” (question wording) = where demand is greatest → that is areas with heavy traffic = option C.\nWhy the other options are wrong\nA (wealthy areas) — contradicted directly: “there isn’t such demand in wealthier areas…”\nB (quiet suburban areas) — contradicted directly: suburbs usually have more places for children to play, so demand is lower, not highest.\n\nLikely reasons you chose the wrong answer\n\nYou may have misheard “busy roads” (it’s easy to miss short phrases).\nYou may have focused on the nearby mention of “wealthier areas” or “suburbs” and confused the meaning (these are comparisons, not the location where demand is greatest).\nYou may not have linked the paraphrase: “demand is greatest” ↔︎ “most needed.”\n\nHow to avoid this kind of mistake (practical tips)\n\nRead question + options BEFORE the audio — underline key words: most needed, wealthy, suburbs, heavy traffic.\nPredict: think what type of place/word you expect to hear (here: a place where children lack play spaces).\nListen for signal words: especially, it’s here that…, there isn’t… — they show emphasis/contrast.\nMap paraphrases: match “busy roads” → “areas with heavy traffic”; “demand is greatest” → “most needed.”\nEliminate contradictions: if the speaker immediately says “there isn’t such demand…”, cross that option out.\nTake a tiny note (one or two words) at the moment you hear the key phrase — e.g., write “busy roads / demand ↑”.\nDon’t get distracted by other nearby details — check the exact sentence containing the answer.\nI miss the word ’’isn’t such”, i hear that demand is greatest ….- &gt; wealthier areas\nbusy road -&gt; heavy traffic # Recording 3\nFirstly, i choose STRUCTURE, i fix it to HOOK, i think the word ‘PROMINENT’ is like the hook ?\nQuick transcript evidence (exact lines)\nFor Q24: Tom says “you’ll need to look at how the item is put together: what structure is it given? Bear in mind that not many people read beyond the first paragraph, so what has the journalist put at the beginning? And if, say, three are conflicting opinions… does one appear near the end…”\nFor Q25: Tom says “what’s the writer’s purpose, or at least the most important one… It may seem to be to inform the public, but often it’s that they want to create fear, or controversy, or to make somebody look ridiculous.”\nWhy Q24 = STRUCTURE, not HOOK\nWhat the question asked: “the 24 … of the item, e.g. what’s made prominent” → this is about how the article is organised (order, emphasis, placement).\nTom’s exact word was structure (“how the item is put together”). That matches the required answer.\nWhy HOOK is wrong: a hook is only the attention‑grabbing opening/lead. The question is broader — it asks about the whole organisation/layout (where things are placed, what’s prominent), not just the opening line.\nTakeaway: if the speaker talks about beginning / where opinions appear / what is prominent, the intended word is structure (organising principle), not just hook.\nWhy Q25 = PURPOSE, not OPINION\nWhat Tom asked you to find: “what’s the writer’s purpose… It may seem to be to inform… often it’s that they want to create fear, or controversy…” — these are intentions/aims (to inform, to upset, to ridicule). That’s purpose.\nWhy OPINION is wrong: Opinion = the writer’s view or stance on the subject (what they think). This is related but different: purpose = why they wrote it; opinion = what they think.\nTip: Listen for verbs/phrases like “to inform”, “to create fear”, “to make somebody look…” — these signal purpose/aim, not merely opinion.\nPractical listening tips to avoid these mistakes\nListen for the exact phrasing. Exam writers often use the same word (e.g., structure, purpose). If you hear it, use it.\nMap categories, not single features. Decide whether the speaker talks about organisation (structure), intention (purpose), viewpoint (opinion) or technique/device (hook/headline/graphic).\nSpot signal words:\nStructure → put together, beginning, end, first paragraph, prominent, what is made prominent\nPurpose → to inform, to persuade, to create fear/controversy, want to…\nOpinion → believes, thinks, argues, suggests\nHook → attention, grab, lead, opening line\nPredict the word type before listening (noun/adjective/plural). That helps you choose between similar options.\nUnderline/mark the question phrase (e.g., “what … of the item”) so you know whether it asks for organisation, intention, or content.\nSmall practice (quick drill)\nRead these short cues and say which label fits: STRUCTURE / PURPOSE / OPINION / HOOK\n“They put the critical detail in paragraph five, where few read.” → STRUCTURE\n“The article seems designed to alarm readers about rising costs.” → PURPOSE\n“The journalist argues that schools are underfunded.” → OPINION\n“The opening sentence uses a shocking fact to grab attention.” → HOOK\n\n\n5 Recording 4\n\nExact evidence from the transcript\n\nThe sentence reads:\n“A major step toward large‑scale commercial soapmaking occurred in 1791, when a French chemist, Nicholas Leblanc, patented a process for turning salt into soda ash (Q38), or sodium carbonate.”\nSo the speaker explicitly says “turning salt into soda ash.” The word you must fill is SALT.\n\nWhy your answer “SOAPS” is wrong\n\nDoesn’t match the spoken phrase. The speaker mentions soap several times elsewhere, which can be a distractor, but here the verb phrase is “turning ___ into …” — the thing being turned into soda ash is salt, not soap.\nMakes no logical sense in context. Soda ash (sodium carbonate) is an alkali used to make soap; you don’t make soda ash from soap. The passage later explains that soda ash combines with fat to form soap — so soap comes after, not before.\nGrammatical fit. The notes ask “making soda ash from ___” so the missing word is a raw material (a substance): salt fits perfectly.\n\nHow this mistake likely happened\n\nYou heard nearby words like soap / soapmaking and jumped to that as the answer (a common trap).\nYou may have missed the short but crucial phrase “turning salt into…”, or mis-copied during note-taking.\n\nHow to avoid this in future (practical tips)\n\nPre‑read the question and predict the type of word needed (here: a substance/noun).\nListen for connecting words like into / from / by — they show transformation or source. (“turning X into Y” → X is the source).\nUnderline nearby keywords in the transcript while listening (e.g., turning…into, soda ash).\nDon’t be fooled by repeated topic words (e.g., soap). Check the exact sentence for the answer.\nTake minimal notes (1–2 letters) of the key word when you hear it — faster than trying to write the whole word immediately.\nIf you’re unsure, use logic: ask whether the proposed answer makes sense in the sequence described (what comes before and after)."

Overall, the sports center will become more convenient and indoor-oriented, with no outdoor activities and more communal space.\nAt present, the sports center consists of a relatively small building and two outdoor courts on each side. The building houses a 25-meter pool, and its facilities include a changing room and a seating area, and there is a gym on the rear and a reception area to the front.\nFollowing the renovations, only the central pool and its facilities remain the same. The building will be expanded to the west and east, removing outdoor courts and making way for more indoor facilities. These include a leisure pool on the western side, which is slightly larger than the central pool, and will have its own changing room, and on the western side, a new sports hall, and two dance studios. The current gym will be lengthened so that it is double its current size. The reception area will also be widened, making it more spacious. On arrival, the visitors to the new center will benefit from a third changing room, a sports shop, and a cafe, all located around the reception area."

    "text": "3.1 True / False / Not Given (Questions 1–7) — analysis & traps\nQ1. Polar bears suffer from various health problems due to the build-up of fat under their skin. — FALSE\n\nWhy: Passage says humans with similar fat would be obese and get diabetes/heart disease but “the polar bear experiences no such consequences.” That directly contradicts the statement.\nTrap: The text compares humans → distracts you into thinking fat = illness. Always check who the comparison refers to.\n\nQ2. The study done by Liu and his colleagues compared different groups of polar bears. — FALSE\n\nWhy: The study compared polar bears with brown bears (their relatives in warmer climates), not different groups of polar bears.\nTrap: The word compared appears — setters try to trick you by changing the comparison object (groups of polar bears vs. polar vs. brown).\n\nQ3. Liu and colleagues were the first researchers to compare polar bears and brown bears genetically. — NOT GIVEN\n\nWhy: The passage reports the study and its findings but does not say whether they were the first to do such a comparison. No info = NOT GIVEN.\nTrap: “First” is a strong claim — absence of explicit wording = NOT GIVEN.\n\nQ4. Polar bears are able to control their levels of bad cholesterol by genetic means. — TRUE\n\nWhy: Liu et al. found a gene (APoB) in polar bears that reduces LDL (“bad” cholesterol). The statement paraphrases that genetic basis.\nTrap: Watch words like control — here it’s acceptable because the passage attributes the LDL reduction to a gene.\n\nQ5. Female polar bears are able to survive for about six months without food. — TRUE\n\nWhy: The passage explicitly describes ~six months of fasting in maternity dens. That matches “survive…without food.”\nTrap: None big — exact phrase appears.\n\nQ6. It was found that the bones of female polar bears were very weak when they came out of their dens in spring. — FALSE\n\nWhy: The study found no evidence of significant loss of bone density when they emerged. The statement says the opposite.\nTrap: Be careful with negative wording (“no evidence” vs “very weak”) — they flip meaning.\n\nQ7. The polar bear’s mechanism for increasing bone density could also be used by people one day. — TRUE\n\nWhy: The passage: “If the mechanism … can be understood, many bedridden humans, and even astronauts, could potentially benefit.” That directly supports the statement.\nTrap: “Could be used” is hypothetical — passage uses the same conditional; therefore TRUE."

    "text": "6.2 Quick exam tips from this section\n\nFor “what surprised them” style questions, listen for explicit surprise phrases (“I found all that hard to believe,” “It must have been terrible”) tied to concrete facts (distance, duration).\nWhen two answers are required, don’t pick a detail mentioned in passing (D/speed) unless the speakers emphasise it as surprising.\nNote attributions: words like “credited with” vs “actually first” indicate subtle corrections (see Q24).\n\n\n6.2.1 ❌ Q24 (Franklin and the haze)\n\nYour answer: not correct.\nCorrect answer: B — He was the first to identify the reason for the haze.\n\nWhy?\nMichelle says Franklin realised the haze was caused by a volcano. Adam then corrects her:\n\n“He’s often credited with that… but in fact a French naturalist got there first.”\n\nSo the claim about Franklin = He was the first. That’s exactly what option B says. The answer is B (even though it was wrong historically, the question is about the claim).\nTrap: Many test-takers confuse what Franklin actually did with what he was credited for.\n\n\n6.2.2 ❌ Q25 (two things that surprised them)\n\nYour answer: one wrong.\nCorrect answers: A — how widespread the effects were & B — how long-lasting the effects were.\n\nWhy?\nAdam says:\n\n“Reports came in not just from Europe but from North America and North Africa too.” → Widespread\n\n\n“And even two years later there were still odd weather events linked to it.” → Long-lasting\n\nOption D (how quickly the ash cloud spread) is mentioned:\n\n“The ash drifted so swiftly…”\n\n\nBut notice — they don’t say they were surprised by that. The question is “What surprised them?” So only A & B fit.\n\nTrap: IELTS loves to mention three things, but only two are correct. Many candidates pick the wrong extra detail (here: speed).\n✅ Key learning for you:\n\nQ24: Focus on the claim (not the correction).\nQ25: Only tick things explicitly linked to “surprised / amazed / hard to believe.” # Recording 4"

    "title": "IELTS Essay Writing by Hand",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Question:\nFewer and fewer people today write by hand using a pen or pencil.\nWhat are the reasons for this?\nIs this a positive or a negative development?\nDavid Lang’s essay:\nToday, the act of writing by hand using a pen or pencil has become increasingly uncommon. This essay will delve into the reasons behind this trend and evaluate whether it is a positive or negative development for individuals and society as a whole.\nOne primary reason for the dwindling use of handwriting is the pervasive presence of technology. Inn an age dominated by computers, smartphones, and tables, individuals find it more convenient to type their thoughts and ideas rather than engaging in the laborious process of writing by hand. The speed and efficiency offered by digital devices have made it easier to edit, store, and share written content, rendering handwriting seemingly obsolete. To illustrate this, consider the rapid rise of communication platforms such as email, instant messaging apps, and social media. These platforms provide users with the ability to effortlessly send and receive messages, eliminating the need for handwritten letters or notes. This convenience extends to practical considerations for professionals in various fields, such as journalists, researchers, and writers, who often rely on digital platforms and word processors for their work. The ease of editing, revising, and sharing digital content outweighs the traditional pen-and-paper approach.\nWhile the decline of handwriting may offer certain advantages, it also brings forth potential negative consequences. Handwriting is an essential skill that fosters cognitive development, improves memory retention, and allows for creative expression. The act of physically forming letters and words engages different areas of the brain, promoting better comprehension and critical thinking skills. Losing this skill may hinder individuals ability to think and express themselves effectively. Most importantly, the personal touch and emotional connection associated with handwritten letters or cards cannot be replicated by digital alternatives. Handwritten messages convey sincerity, thoughtfulness, and a see of intimacy. Losing the art of handwriting may irrevocably erode these meaningful human connections.\nIn conclusion, the decline of handwriting can be attributed to the prevalence of technology and practical considerations. While there are advantages to digital communication and typing, the negative implications for cognitive development and personal connections are more significant and must be mitigated by the relevant authorities.\nArguing that it is a positive development\nIn today’s digital age, fewer and fewer people write by hand and using a pen or pencil. This shift can be attributed to pared technological advancements and changing educational practices, and I firmly believe that it is a positive development. The move away from handwriting not only enhances efficiency and accessibility but also reflects progress towards modern communication methods.\nThe decline in handwriting is primarily driven by the ubiquity of digital devices and evolving communication needs. With the widespread availability of computers, smartphones, and tablets, individuals find it more convenient to type and send messages instantly. Educational institutions are increasingly incorporating technology into their curricula, emphasizing digital literacy over traditional penmanship. Moreover, the rise of social media and email as primary communication tools has diminished the need for handwritten correspondence. These factors have collectively contributed to a cultural shift where efficiency and speed in communication are prioritized over the art of handwriting.\nTransitioning from handwriting to digital writing brings several significant benefits. Firstly, digital communication enhances productivity by enabling rapid information exchange and easy editing, which is especially beneficial in professional and academic settings. Additionally, typing reduces issues related to illegible handwriting, thereby minimizing misunderstandings. Digital platforms also offer vast storage and the ability to search through documents instantly, streamlining information management. Furthermore, this shift is environmentally friendly, as it reduces the consumption of paper and other stationery supplies. Overall, the adoption of digital writing foster greater accessibility and adaptability in our fast-pace, globalized world, contributing to more efficient and sustainable practices.\nIn conclusion, the decreasing reliance on handwriting in favor of digital communication is driven by technological advancements and evolving social practices. I contend that this development is positive, as it significantly boosts efficiency, clarity, and environmental sustainability while aligning with the demands of modern life. Embracing digital writing is not only a natural progression but also a vital step towards more effective and accessible communication in the 21st century."

    "section": "1.1 Review",
    "text": "1.1 Review\nWe began our study of complex sentences by learning that a complex sentence is an independent clause (a sentence) plus a subordinate clause. We learned that there are three types of subordinate clauses: adverb, adjective (the relative clause), and noun.\nWe have covered subordinate clauses of the adverb and adjective variety. The adverbial clauses appear to the left or the right of independent clauses and begin with subordinating conjunctions:\n\nafter, as if, as long as, as soon as, although, as, as if, because, before, even if, if, since, so that, though, till, unless, until, when, whenever, wherever, while.\n\nThe adjectival clauses are relative clauses. We focused on three key relative pronouns: who, that, and which.\nThis bring us to our final clause type-the noun clause.\nLike their cousins are adverbial and relative clauses, the noun clauses, too, begin with key words. We can call these key word noun-clause markers.\nHere is a list:\n\nthat, if, whether\n{words that can be used to create question} how, what, when, where, whom, why\n{the -ever words} however, whatever, whenever, wherever, whichever, whoever, whomever.\n\nIf we take an independent clause (a sentence) and add a noun-clause marker to the front of it, we get a noun clause.\n\nnoun-clause marker + independent clause = noun clause\n\nExamples:\ntake a sentences: the foal was delivered by helicopter\nadd a noun-clause marker: that\nget a noun clause: that the foal was delivered by helicopter\nOnce more:\n\ntake a sentence: the Shah wanted it delivered\nadd a noun-clause marker: whenever\nget a noun clause: whenever the Shah wanted it delivered.\n\nWhen a noun clause get added to an independent clause, the result is a complex sentence. Study two examples:\n\nexample 1: What the clown found so funny was a mystery. (complex sentence? no)\nexample 2: We did not understand why George was twitching in the forsythias (complex sentence? yes)\n\nA complex sentence consists of an independent clause and at least one subordinate clause. Example 1 above consists of a noun clause plus a predicate (was a mystery) and, therefore, is not a complex sentence. In example 2, however, we do find one independent and one subordinate clause.\n\nindependent clause: we did not understand\nsubordinate clause: why George was twitching in the forsythias"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Some people think that students should study the science of food and how to prepare it. Others believe students should spend time on more important subjects. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.\n\nSome people argue that schools should teach children about food science and cooking, while others believe the curriculum should concentrate only on academic subjects. This essay will examine both perspective before explaining why I believe that teaching food science and cooking is the more beneficial approach.\nOn the one hand, those who prioritize academic subjects argue that focus on food science or cooking in school is a waste of valuable study time. This is because they suggest that students should devote their time to core academic subjects, such as mathematics and science, which are regarded as more important for future success. For instance, entry to prestigious universities usually depends on high grades in these subjects, rather than in cooking or food science. For this reason, they see little value including cooking or food science in the school curriculum.\nOn the other hand, it is also believed that learning cooking and food science is essential for young people to become independent adults. In particular, understanding nutrition and learning to cook simple meals can help young people lead healthier lives. For example, students who know how to cook are less likely to rely on fast food when they live away from home. Furthermore, these skills allow them to enjoy a wider variety of meals and to manage their finances more effectively. In fact, students who cook their own meals often spend far less money than those who rely on restaurants or fast food. As a result, these skills prepare young people to live both more healthy and more economically when they become independent.\nIn conclusion, while some people think schools should focus only on academic subjects, others believe that cooking and food science are equally important. I agree with the latter view, as these skills not only promote healthier lifestyles but also help young people manage their finances and prepare for independent living."

    "title": "IELTS Essay Having Children at an Older Age",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Question:\nSome people choose to have their first child at an older age. What are the reasons? Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?\nDavid Lang’s sample In recent years, an increasing number of individuals have opted to start their families later in life. This trend raises the question of why more people are choosing to have their first child at an older age and whether the benefits of doing so justify the drawbacks.\nOne of the primary reasons for delaying parenthood is the pursuit of career stability in a worrying economic climate. In today’s competitive job market, many individuals, particularly women, prefer to establish themselves professionally before starting a family. By focusing on their careers in their twenties and early thirties, they can achieve financial security and attain higher positions, which often translates to job satisfaction and greater resources for their future children. This growing trend is reflected in how mainstream society now places significant emphasis on personal development and achieving personal goals before embarking on parenthood. For that reason, many young adults prioritize their own personal and financial welfare, a situation that engenders an atmosphere less conductive to having children early in life.\nThere are legitimate disadvantages connected with having children later in life. One of the primary concerns is the potential health risks for both the mother and the child. Advanced maternal age is often associated with a higher risk of complications such as gestational diabetes, hypertension, and chromosomal abnormalities. However, despite these drawbacks, the advantages of having children later in life due to greater maturity overshadow the hypothetical drawbacks. The emotional maturity and life experience that older parents bring to child-rearing can result in a more stable and nurturing environment. Older parents are likely to be more financially secure and better prepared to provide for their children’s education and well-being. The ability to make well-considered decisions and the patience developed over time can contribute to a more thoughtful and deliberate approach to parenting.\nIn conclusion, while there are valid concerns regarding the health risks associated with having children later in life, the benefits, such as financial stability, emotional maturity, and better preparation for parenthood, outweigh these disadvantages. As societal norms and medical advancements continue to evolve, the rend of delaying parenthood is likely to remain prevalent, reflecting the changing priorities and values of modern individuals.\nSample, disadvantages over advantages.\nAn increasing number of individuals are choosing to have their first child at an older age. This trend is driven by factors such as career prioritization, financial security, and a desire for greater personal maturity. While some argue that the benefits of delayed parenthood - like improved financial stability and enhanced life experience - outweigh the disadvantages, I strongly disagree. The potential health risks, fertility issues, and other practical challenges mean that the disadvantages ultimately outweigh any advantages.\nModern society has shifted priorities, and many couples now postpone parenthood for several reasons. Primarily, individuals strive to establish their careers and achieve financial stability before starting a family. This approach allows prospective parents to create a secure environment for their child, free from economic uncertainty. Furthermore, many believe that greater life experience and emotional maturity can lead to more thoughtful parenting decisions. As a result, the decision to delay having a first child is often seen as a strategic move to optimize one’s personal and professional circumstances.\nDespite these reasons, the drawbacks of having a first child at an older age are significant. Health concerns are paramount; older mothers face increased risks of pregnancy complications, such as gestational diabetes and hypertension, which can jeopardize both maternal and infant health. Additionally, advancing age is closely linked to decreased fertility, often necessitating expensive and emotionally draining fertility treatments. Beyond health, older parents might experience reduced physical stamina, which is crucial for the demanding nature of childcare, and a larger generational gap that can affect the parent-child relationship. These challenges make the prospect of delayed parenthood less attractive, as the risks and long-term implications overshadow the benefits of waiting.\nIn conclusion, although delaying parenthood may provide some advantages in terms of financial and emotional preparedness, the significant health risks, fertility challenges, and practical issues associated with having a first child later in life outweigh these benefit. Therefore, i contend that the disadvantages of postponing parenthood ultimately make it a less favorable option compared to earlier family planning.\nSample, advantages over disadvantages.\nIn recent years, an increasing number of individuals have chosen to have their first child at an older age. This trend is largely influenced by factors such as the pursuit of career goals, the desire for financial stability, and the accumulation of life experience before entering parenthood. I firmly believe that these advantages not only lead to more secure and thoughtful family planning but also contribute to improved parenting outcomes, ultimately outweighing the potential disadvantages.\nModern societal shifts have prompted many prospective parents to postpone starting a family. Primarily, individuals are keen to establish a stable career and secure a robust financial foundation before welcoming a child. This approach allows them to create a nurturing environment where the child’s needs are met without the stress of economic uncertainty. Furthermore, waiting until later in life often results in enhanced emotional maturity and life experience, enabling parents to make more considered decisions and effectively manage the challenges of raising a child. These reasons underscore why many see value in delaying parenthood as a strategic, long-term investment in both personal and familial well-being.\nThe advantages of choosing to have a child at an older age are manifold. With a well-established career and financial security, older parents are better equipped to provide for their child’s educational and extracurricular needs, contributing to the child’s overall development. In addition, greater maturity and life experience often translate into more patient, empathetic, and balanced parenting. Such parents typically possess enhanced problem-solving skills and resilience, which can be invaluable when navigating the inevitable challenges of childcare. Moreover, studies have shown that older parents tend to invest more time and resources in their children’s upbringing, resulting in a more stable and nurturing home environment. Collectively, these advantages not only promote healthier family dynamics but also pave the way for the child’s long-term success and well-being.\nIn conclusion, while there are inherent challenges associated with delayed parenthood, the benefits- ranging from financial stability and career establishment to increased emotional maturity and effective parenting- clearly outweigh the drawbacks. By choosing to have a child at an older age, many individuals are better prepared to offer a secure, supportive, and enriching environment for their children, ultimately leading to more positive outcomes for families."

    "text": "7.1 Topic: Literature\nIELTS Speaking Part 2 – Cue Card Sample\n❓Describe an exhibition or display you have seen that left an impression on you.\nYou should say:\nWhat the exhibition was about\nWhere you saw it\nWhat was on display\nAnd explain why it left an impression on you\nLast year, I went to a university open day, and there was a very interesting exhibition about British literature in the 19th century, focusing on Charles Dickens. It was prepared by students from the English department, and it showed how Dickens’s novels were connected to life in that time.\nThe display had big posters with summaries of some of his books like Oliver Twist, Bleak House, and Nicholas Nickleby. Each book had a theme. For example, Oliver Twist was used to show poverty and how poor children didn’t go to school. Nicholas Nickleby had some parts about entertainment, because it mentioned a group of actors. There were also quotes from the books and short explanations about social problems.\nWhat impressed me was how literature could help people learn about the past. I always thought novels were just stories, but this exhibition showed me that they can also talk about important social issues, like education, justice, and even women’s lives. I think it was a very creative and meaningful way to present history.\nDo you think literature can still influence society today?\nBand 7 Answer:\nYes, I think so. Literature helps people see the problems in society. Even today, many writers talk about topics like racism, poverty, or climate change. These books make people think, and maybe change their opinions. Like in the past, Dickens used his novels to show people how poor families lived, and some authors do similar things today.\n❓Why do some authors choose to write about social issues?\nBand 7 Answer:\nI believe they want to help or teach people. Some writers care about problems in society, so they use their books to talk about them. It’s a way to send a message, and maybe make people care more. For example, Dickens wanted people to know about the bad conditions for poor people, and that’s why he showed those things in his books.\n❓Do you think historical literature is still relevant today?\nBand 7 Answer:\nYes, I think old books still have value. Even if the language is old, the ideas are similar. Many stories talk about things we still see today, like unfair laws, rich and poor people, or family problems. Also, reading historical books can help us understand the culture and life in the past."

    "section": "7.2 Topic: Rural Development & Sustainability",
    "text": "7.2 Topic: Rural Development & Sustainability\nQuestion 1: What are the biggest challenges facing rural areas in developing countries?\nBand 7 Answer:\nI think one of the main challenges is the lack of water. In dry or arid areas, people can’t grow enough crops because there’s no dependable water supply. Another problem is transportation. Farmers sometimes grow produce, but they can’t get it to the market, so it gets spoiled. Also, I think there are not enough jobs, so people rely too much on natural resources like forests, for example cutting trees to make charcoal, which is not sustainable.\nOR\nOne major challenge is definitely access to water, especially in regions that are dry and arid. Without a dependable water supply, it’s incredibly difficult to support agriculture, which is often the main source of income. Another issue is the lack of infrastructure — things like roads and transport systems — which makes it hard for farmers to get their produce to market. As a result, a lot of food ends up being spoiled. I’d also say that over-reliance on natural resources, like cutting down trees for charcoal, leads to environmental degradation, which is not sustainable in the long run\nQuestion 2: What kinds of development programmes are most effective in rural communities?\nProgrammes that support agriculture are really useful. For example, if there is a river nearby, they can build irrigation systems to help with farming. I also think helping people learn new techniques like food preservation or fish farming can make a big difference. It’s better when the community is involved and provides labour because that makes them feel responsible.\nPrograms that focus on sustainable farming practices tend to be the most effective. For instance, setting up irrigation systems using nearby rivers can make a huge difference in crop production. It’s also important to involve the local community directly. When people contribute their own labour or make suggestions — like introducing beekeeping or fish farming — they’re more invested in the success of the project. I think combining technical support with community engagement creates the best outcomes.\nQuestion 3: Do you think governments or local communities should take the lead in rural development?\nBand 7 Answer:\nBoth should work together. Governments can give funding and support, but local people know their land and what works. For example, in one case, local farmers suggested starting bee colonies, which wasn’t in the original plan, but it worked well. So, community ideas should be listened to.\nI believe both have important roles to play. Governments can provide funding, training, and help with the design and long-term planning of development programmes. But local communities know their environment best and often come up with creative, practical solutions that outsiders might overlook. For example, in one case, farmers suggested starting bee colonies, which weren’t part of the original plan, but ended up becoming a valuable source of income. So collaboration between both sides is key."

In contrast, men with full-time work were unchanged at just 1 hour in 1985 and 1995, though there was a slight rise to 1.5 hours in 2005.\nWomen with part-time employment were slightly lower than their unemployed counterparts throughout the period, beginning at 5.3 hours in 1985, before declining to 5 hours over the next 5 years, and then finishing the period with a surge to 6 hours.

    "text": "Part 3\n\nDo you think tidiness is important in the workplace? Absolutely. A tidy workplace not only creates a more professional image but also boosts efficiency. When things are organized, it’s easier to find what you need, which saves time and reduce stress. Moreover, a clean environment can promote better focus and even improve team morale.\nWhy do some people struggle to stay tidy? There could be a few reasons. Some people simply lead very busy lives and don’t prioritize tidiness, while others may not have developed habits of organization from a young age. In some cases, people might not even notice the mess around them - they’ve grown accustomed to it. For a few, it could also be tied to mental health challenges, like anxiety or ADHD, which can effect one’s ability to maintain order.\nHow can parents teach children to be tidy? The most effective way is by setting a good example. If children see their parents consistently keeping things organized, they’re more likely to adopt those habits themselves. It also helps to make tidying part of a daily routine and turn it into something fun or rewarding - for instance, though games or praise. Teaching them to take pride in their space can go a long way.\nDo you think technology helps people stay more organized and tidy? Definitely. There are so many apps and digital tools now that can help people manages their time, declutter digitally, and keep track of tasks or schedules. Even simple things like calendar reminder or to-do list apps can encourage tidier habits. That said, technology can also contribute to digital clutter if not used mindfully.\nIs there a difference in tidiness between younger and older generations? In some ways, yes. Older generations often place a high value on physical tidiness, perhaps because they grew up in a time when everything had to be done manually. Younger people, on the other hand, might prioritize digital organization - like keeping their phones or laptops neatly arranged. However, i think personal habits play a bigger role than age."

    "text": "0.1 Review\nA complex sentence is a sentence that contains an independent clause and one or more subordinate clauses.\nSubordinate clauses can be classified as adverb clauses, adjective clauses, or noun clauses.\nThose subordinate clauses that function as adjectives are known as relative clauses.\nRelative clauses begin with one of the following relative pronouns.\n\nwho, what, which, whom, whose, what, when, where, why. We are going to focus on three that we use most often in our writing: who, that, and which. Examples:\nI met a man {who had lost the ability to cry or sing}. (The independent clause I met a man + the relative clause who had lost the ability to cry or sing).\nThere came a dream of hopes {that never yet had flushed his cheek}. (The independent clause there came a dream of hopes + the relative clause that never yet had flushed his cheek).\nThe speaker spoke of youth, {which night and time have quenched forever}. (the independent clause the speaker spoke of youth + the relative clause which night and time have quenched forever)."

    "text": "2.1 Rewrite Introduction\n\n2.1.1 Rewrite\nThe table shows how many hours people of different age use internet for fun and for work each week. My answer: The table illustrates the number of hours people of various ages use the internet for leisure and for professional each week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIssue\nExplanation\nCorrection\n\n\n\n\n“for professional”\n“Professional” is an adjective. You need a noun here.\nUse “for work” or “for professional purposes”\n\n\n“people of various ages”\nGood, but can be made more natural.\nTry “people in different age groups”\n\n\n“use the internet”\nFine, but could be made more academic.\nTry “spend online” or “use the internet for…”\n\n\nWord order\nEnding on “each week” is okay, but it reads better earlier.\nRearrange for fluency.\n\n\n\nBetter: The table illustrates the number of hours per week that people in different age groups spend online for leisure and work-related activities. Or: The table provides data on the weekly hours spent online by people of various age group, categorized by leisure and professional purposes.\nRewrite: The bar chart shows the percentage of households in four different income levels that had internet access in 2010 and 2020. I write: The bar chart illustrates the distribution of households in four various income levels that had internet access in 2010 and 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIssue\nCorrection\n\n\n\n\n“four various”\n❌ Redundant. Use either “four” or “various” — not both. → ✅ “four different” or just “four”\n\n\n“distribution of households”\n✅ Okay, but could be clearer — this chart shows percentages, not the count or physical distribution. Try “percentage of households”\n\n\nGrammar and flow\nSentence is understandable but can be more formal and concise\n\n\n\nBetter: The bar chart illustrates the percentage of households across four income levels that had access to the internet in 2010 and 2020. Or: The bar chart compares the proportion of households with internet access in four income groups for the years 2010 and 2020.\n\n\n2.1.2 Rewrite\nThe line graph shows the number of international students enrolled in Canadian universities between 2005 and 2020, broken down by region of origin.\nThe line graph illustrates how many international students enrolled in Canadian universities between 2005 and 2020, categorize by area of origin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIssue\nExplanation\nCorrection\n\n\n\n\n“how many international students”\nOkay, but more formal: “the number of international students”\n\n\n\n“categorize”\n❌ Wrong form → should be “categorized” (past participle in passive structure)\n\n\n\n“area of origin”\nAcceptable, but “region of origin” or “by region” is more common in academic writing\n\n\n\nFlow\nCombine ideas more smoothly with a formal tone\n\n\n\n\nBetter: The line graph illustrates the number of international students enrolled in Canadian universities from 2005 to 2020, categorized by region of origin. Or: The line graph presents data on international student enrollment in Canadian universities over a 15-year period, broken down by region of origin.\n\n\n2.1.3 Rewrite\nThe pie charts show the proportion of energy produced from five different sources in a European country in 1980 and 2020. I write: The pie charts illustrate the percentage of energy made from five different sources in a European country in 1980 and 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIssue\nExplanation\nFix\n\n\n\n\n“energy made from”\n❌ Informal/awkward for Task 1. Use “produced from” or “generated by”\n\n\n\n“in a European country”\n✅ This is fine and accurate\n\n\n\n“five different sources”\n✅ Good — “five sources” is enough, but “different” is okay for emphasis\n\n\n\n\nBetter: The pie charts illustrate the proportion of energy generated from five sources in a European country in the years 1980 and 2020. Or: The two pie charts compare the share of energy production by five distinct sources in a European country in 1980 and 2020.\n\n\n2.1.4 Rewrite\nThe table displays the average monthly income (in USD) for workers in three different sectors in five countries. I write: The table illustrates the salary of workers in three different sectors in five countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIssue\nComment\nSuggested Fix\n\n\n\n\n“illustrates”\n✅ Good verb for visuals\n\n\n\n“the salary”\n❌ Slightly vague → “salary” is better expressed as “average monthly income” to match the task\n\n\n\n“three different sectors”\n✅ Fine, though “various sectors” or “economic sectors” may be more formal\n\n\n\n“in five countries”\n✅ Good — you could also say “across five countries” for variety\n\n\n\n\nBetter: The table illustrates the average monthly income of workers across three sectors in five different countries. Or: The table presents data on the average monthly earnings of employees in three occupational sectors across five countries.\n\n\n2.1.5 Rewrite\nThe line graph shows the percentage of the population aged 65 and over in Japan, Sweden, and the USA from 1940 to 2040. I write: The line graph illustrates the proportion of the people who over 65 and over in Japan, Sweden, and the US between 1940 and 2040.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIssue\nExplanation\nFix\n\n\n\n\n“the people who over 65 and over”\n❌ Grammar mistake. You need: “people aged 65 and over”\n\n\n\n“the proportion of the people”\n❌ Too wordy. Use “the proportion of people” (no “the” before “people”)\n\n\n\n“US” vs “USA”\n✅ Both are fine. Choose one and stay consistent\n\n\n\n“between 1940 and 2040”\n✅ Correct and clear\n\n\n\n\nBetter: The line graph illustrates the proportion of people aged 65 and over in Japan, Sweden, and the USA between 1940 and 2040. Or: The line graph compares the percentage of the population aged 65 and above in Japan, Sweden, and the United States from 1940 to 2040.\nI write overview:\nWhile the number of USA senior citizen is slightly increase in throughout the period, that figure of Sweden and Japan are reduce on that time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIssue\nExplanation\nCorrection\n\n\n\n\n“number of USA senior citizen”\n❌ Wrong form: should be “percentage of senior citizens in the USA”\n\n\n\n“is slightly increase”\n❌ Incorrect verb form: should be “increases slightly”\n\n\n\n“are reduce”\n❌ Incorrect verb form again: should be “decline”, but actually this is factually wrong\n\n\n\nTrend accuracy\n❌ In fact, Japan and Sweden both increase overall, not decrease\n\n\n\n\nBetter: Overall, the proportion of elderly people increased in all three countries throughout the period, with Japan showing the most dramatic growth after 2020. Or: In general, all three countries experienced a rise in the percentage of people aged 65 and above, with Japan’s elderly population rising sharply after 2020. ## Overview\nAn overview I write: Overall, it is clear that people spend the time on the internet for professional purposes most in their 20s, while their time for online leisure is largest when teens.\nBetter:\nOverall, it is clear that internet use for work peaks among people in their 20s, while leisure-related usage is highest among teenagers.\n\nAvoid exact figures\nFocus on trends, not facts\nUse comparative language: most common, highest, dominant, peak, etc."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Some people think that children should learn a second language at primary school. Others believe it is better to wait until secondary school. Discuss both views and give your opinion.\nintroduction\nIn many parts of the world, when children begin to learn a second language has become a topic of debate. This essay will discuss both sides of the argument and explain why I completely agree that starting at primary school is more beneficial.\nIt is true that children who are learning language earlier children who start learning a second language early are more receptive to new sounds and structures than those who start later. First and foremost, at primary school age, children’s brains are more flexible, allowing them to pick up pronunciation and grammar more naturally acquire correct pronunciation and grammatical structures with greater ease. As a result, they often develop a stronger accent and better overall fluency than those who start later. Furthermore, learning a language does not need a highly abstract thinking cognitive skill like math, physics, … subjects like mathematics and physics, which are normally developed in more mature students. So, letting them invest in a second language when in primary school is a better investment than other fields. -&gt; Therefore/ Hence, it is more effective to focus on second language acquisition at primary school than on other fields.\nNevertheless, some argue that children should begin learning a second language at secondary school or later, rather than at primary school. They suggest that older students have more developed cognitive abilities, allowing them to grasp complex grammar rules and language structures more quickly than younger learners. As a result, they can learn language more effectively in a shorter time than younger age they may achieve noticeable progress in a shorter period. In addition, adolescents may be more motivated because they can appreciate its relevance to future education and career opportunities / they can understand the relevance of language learning for their future education and career prospects. Because of that, they can have a choice of themself about which language they should learn and be more independent in the road of learning. They also have more autonomy in choosing which language to study and can take greater responsibility for their learning. While these points have some merit, I believe the advantages of starting early outweigh the benefits of a later start.\nIn conclusion, while some argue that older children may learn a second language more quickly due to their cognitive maturity and motivation, I firmly believe that starting at primary school is more beneficial. Early exposure provides a longer period for practice, enhances pronunciation and grammar acquisition, and supports overall cognitive development. Consequently, beginning language learning at a young age offers advantages that outweigh those of a later start."

    "text": "Sentence connectors, conjunctions and pro-forms are used to link ideas in academic writing and speaking in a number of ways.\n\nSentence connectors link sentences. There is usually a full stop at the end of the first sentence, and the sentence connector often comes at the start of the next.\nConjunctions link clauses within sentences. A comma often separates the clauses. Most conjunctions come at the start of their clause.\nPro-forms are general words or phrases that refer back to more specific words or phrases, avoiding repetition.\n\nExamples:\nIn sum1, temperature is an important factor determining the shelf life of a food product in that2 variations in temperature can result in the growth of microorganisms which can cause the product the spoil. Furthermore3, incorrect freezing can damage the proteins of meat or other products. Given that4 the maintenance of the correct temperature over a long period is essential, it is necessary to use time temperature indicators. Studies have shown that these indicators reduce food waste considerably. As well5, they reduce the number of foodborne illnesses.\nSociology researchers use two types of information: primary data and secondary data. The former6 is collected by the researcher themselves, whereas7 secondary data already exists in some form, such as documents or previous research. Collecting primary data can be time-consuming and expensive, and as such8, undergraduate researchers often prefer to use secondary data."

Despite reaching a low at about 160 grams a week, it recovered to hit a high of about 230 grams. However, after 1988, beef consumption fell almost continuously, and by 2004 had almost 120 grams. Lamb followed a similar declining trajectory to beef, although its figures were consistently lower. Lamb consumption, which started at 150 grams, fell steadily throughout the period, before decreased decreasing to around 60 grams in 2004.\nOn the contrary By contrast, chicken consumption climbed gradually from below 150 grams, and overtook the other meats and fish in consumption from around 1989. Notably, the increase in chicken consumption coincided with a decline in both beef and lamb, and by 2002, it peaked at just over 260 grams per person each week before slightly dropped to 250 grams in 2004.\nMeanwhile, fish remained the least consumed protein throughout the entire period, showing minimal fluctuation.

Although it dropped to around 160 grams early in the period, it recovered to a peak of 230 grams before experiencing a continuous decline after 1988, reaching just over 100 grams by 2004. Lamb followed a similar but less pronounced downward trend, falling steadily from 150 grams to approximately 60 grams.\nBy contrast, chicken consumption began below 150 grams but rose steadily, overtaking both lamb and beef around 1989. It peaked at 260 grams per person in 2002 before slightly falling to 250 grams in the final year.\nFish consumption remained the lowest throughout the period, starting at around 60 grams and showing only a slight decline to just under 50 grams by 2004."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Let’s look at an example of this kind of question:\n*Nowadays governments are investing more in public transport such as buses and trains rather than in building new roads.*\n*What are the reasons for this?*\n*Is this a positive or negative development?*\n\nClear position\nFor this kind of task we need to discuss both questions. In the first question, we are given a situation and asked to explain why. The second question requires a clear opinion so we must choose a side. This is very important for our task response score. If we don’t choose a side and support that ‘position’ clearly, we will lose marks for our task response. We will get a maximum of 5 for task achievement if we do not choose a side.\nIt’s not important which side we choose as long as we choose one. Here are the options for the second questions:\n\nAgree: We think it’s a positive development that governments are spending more money on public transport. We support this opinion.\nDisagree: We think it’s a negative development that governments are spending more money on public transport. We support this opinion.\n\n\n\nClear essay structure\nDavid Lang recommend that we should give our opinion in the introduction as well as the conclusion (for all IELTS Task 2 questions). It’s OK to write a very general introduction and leave our opinion to the end. But it’s not as clear and we might run out of time before we’ve hot to our conclusion, so overall it’s a risky strategy. If we don’t choose a side and support that ‘position’ clearly, we will lose marks for our task response.\nTherefore, him suggested essay structure is four paragraphs. The opinion is presented in the introduction and re-stated in the conclusion. Ideally each body paragraph in the introduction and re-stated in the conclusion.\n\n\nPossible Essay structures\n1. Agree - we feel it’s a positive development that governments are spending more money on public transport.\nWe need at least one good reason why it’s happening and one good reason why it’s a positive development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParagraph 1 (intro)\nParaphrase both questions and state your overall opinion (you feel it’s a positive development)\n\n\nParagraph 2 (body 1)\nExplain and support your reason why governments are spending more money on public transport.\n\n\nParagraph 3 (body 2)\nExplain and support your reason why this is a positive development.\n\n\nParagraph 4 (conclusion)\nRe-state your overall opinion (you feel it’s a positive development) and  summarise your main reasons.\n\n\n\n2. Disagree: - we feel it’s a negative development that governments are spending more money on public transport.\nWe need at least one good reason why it’s happening and one good reason why it’s a negative development. Only the parts highlighted below are different from the first essay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Paragraph 1 (intro)\n#### Paraphrase both questions and state your overall opinion (you feel it’s a negative development)\n\n\n#### Paragraph 2 (body 1)\n#### Explain and support your reason why governments are spending more money on public transport.\n\n\n#### Paragraph 3 (body 2)\n#### Explain and support your reason why this is a negative development.\n\n\n#### Paragraph 4 (conclusion)\n#### Re-state your overall opinion (you feel it’s a negative development) and  summarise your main reasons."

As a result, obesity rates have increased.\nDue to rising housing costs, many young adults are unable to afford their own homes.\n\nIn Task 2, you must present clear, logical ideas and support them.

Don’t use “although” when the ideas are not truly opposing.\nNot -&gt; Although technology is important, it is useful.\nYes -&gt; Although technology is convenient, it can reduce face-to-face interaction.\n\n\n\n4.1.6 IELTS Sample Sentences\n\nTask 1 (Data Comparison)\nWhile the number of international students in Canada rose significantly, the figure for the UK remained unchanged over the same period.\nIn contrast to the steady rise in smartphone use, landline phone subcriptions declined.\n\n\nTask 2 (Balanced Argument)\nAlthough public healthcare is available in many countries, access and quality often vary greatly.\nDespite widespread concern about climate change, individual action remains limited.\nSome believe exams are the best measure of learning, whereas others argue that coursework offers a more accurate evaluation.\n\n\n\n4.1.7 Summary: When to use Contrast/ Concession\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIELTS Task\nUse It When…\n\n\n\n\nTask 1\nComparing two or more trends, categories, groups, or time periods\n\n\nTask 2\nPresenting two sides of an argument, addressing counterarguments, or qualifying your position"

    "text": "4.4 Time-based Sentences\n\nTask 1 (W1): ✔️ Very common and essential\nTask 2 (W2): ✔️ Occasionally useful in examples or background information\n\nTime-based sentences include time clauses to show when, how long, or in what sequence something happens. They use time-related conjunctions or phrases like:\n\nwhen, while, before, after, until, since, as soon as, by the time, once, during, over the period, throughout\n\nThese sentences help IELTS candidates describe:\n\nTrends over time (W1)\nEvent sequences, cause-effect timelines, or historical context (W2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nTask 1\nTo clearly describe changes or trends over a period using accurate tense and logical sequencing\n\n\nTask 2\nTo provide context or realistic examples, especially when explaining changes in habits, policies, or social patterns\n\n\n\nUsing time-based clauses accurately demonstrates your control of grammar and tense.\n\n4.4.1 Sentence Structure Patterns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConjunction / Phrase\nExample Sentence\n\n\n\n\nWhen\nWhen internet access became widespread, online shopping began to grow.\n\n\nWhile\nWhile mobile phone use increased, landline subscriptions declined.\n\n\nBefore / After\nAfter 2010, renewable energy use started rising.\n\n\nSince\nEnergy consumption has declined since 2015.\n\n\nDuring / Throughout\nSales remained stable throughout the decade.\n\n\nBy the time\nBy the time the law was implemented, the damage had already been done.\n\n\nOnce / As soon as\nOnce electric vehicles became affordable, demand surged.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4.2 Examples in IELTS Writing\n\nTask 1: Describing Data Trends\nTask 1 often involves graphs or charts that show data over time, so time-based language is critical.\n\nAfter 2005, car ownership in Europe increased sharply.\nWhile the number of graduates rose in the UK, it remained stable in Canada.\nBy 2020, the unemployment rate had dropped significantly.\nDuring the first decade, the figures fluctuated slightly.\n\nThese phrases help sequence events, describe parallel trends, and show cause-effect relationships over time.\n\n\nTask 2: Background, Examples, or Context\nTime clause are not the focus of Task 2, but they strengthen examples and explanations.\n\nSince the rise of social media, communication habits have changed dramatically.\nBefore smartphones, people relied on face-to-face interaction.\nAs soon as restrictions were lifted, tourism began to recover.\nBy the time children reach adolescence, they are already familiar with digital tools.\n\nThis adds realism and sophistication to your arguments or explanations.\n\n\n\n4.4.3 Time Expressions to Use in IELTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nExamples\n\n\n\n\nPoints in time\nin 2010, at the beginning of the period, by 2020, before 2005\n\n\nDuration\nover the 10-year period, during the decade, from 2010 to 2020\n\n\nSequence / Order\nafter, before, when, once, as soon as, by the time, until\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4.4 Tense Choice: Critical for Time Clauses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime Expression\nTense Commonly Used\n\n\n\n\nAfter / Before\nPast Simple or Past Perfect\n\n\nSince\nPresent Perfect\n\n\nBy the time\nPast Perfect (for earlier action), Past Simple (for later action)\n\n\nDuring / Throughout\nPast Simple or Present Perfect\n\n\n\nExample:\nBy the time the chart ends, sales had risen by 60%.\nSince 2010, the number of users has doubled.\n\n\n4.4.5 Samples Sentences\n\nTask 1\nAfter 2008, the number of internet users in developing countries rose dramatically, overtaking those in developed nations by 2012.\nThroughout the period, employment rates remained relatively stable, with only minor fluctuations\n\n\nTask 2\nSince environmental awareness has increased in developing countries rose dramatically, more individuals are adopting sustainable habits.\nOnce children are exposed to screens at an early ages, their social skills may be affected.\n\n\n\n4.4.6 Tips for Using Time Clauses Effectively\n\nCombine with other sentence types\nWhile industrial output declined, renewable energy use began to rise, indicating a shift in production priorities.\n\n\nBe precise with time references\nInstead of: After some time, sales increased.\nTry: After 2005, sales increased sharply, reaching a peak in 2018.\n\n\nVary time phrases\nUse alternatives to avoid repetition.\n\nInstead of always saying “after 2010”, try:\n\nFrom 2010 onwards\nFollowing 2010\nIn the years after 2010\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4.7 Summary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsed in\nFunction\nWhy Important\n\n\n\n\nTask 1\nDescribe sequences, trends, or time frames\nHelps organize data clearly and accurately\n\n\nTask 2\nProvide context or realistic examples\nAdds depth to explanations and supports logical flow"

Because of this, stories about them help to sell thousands of newspapers and magazines. However, the benefits of fame are not without their challenges.\nThere are clear advantages to being famous. The images presented in the media show us celebrities enjoying an enviable lifestyle: they live in huge mansions, drive expensive cars, and wear the latest in high fashion. Thus, fame clearly brings great wealth. In addition, their frequent appearances in the media mean that celebrities have an influence that extends beyond their professional skills. This influence stems from the fact that young people want to be like them, and so the famous can earn even more money by endorsing different products and brands. Although just being in the spotlight may be rewarding, the main benefits of fame appear to be financial and material.\nNevertheless, this level of fame also has its problems. The ability to influence others and the notion of fame itself are both dependent on appearing in the media on a regular basis, which means that celebrities have very little privacy. The same media that creates their fame is also very happy to share stories that are less positive. In fact, it could be argued that negative stories sell more newspapers or attract more clicks than any other. This puts an enormous amount of pressure not only on the individuals concerned, but also on the people close to them. As a result, their relationships and family life suffer. Clearly, the fortune that stems from fame comes at a substantial personal cost.\nIn summary, although there are clear financial benefits to being famous, there are also enormous personal challenges. In my view, the constant media attention is far too intrusive, and the loss of privacy is much too high a price to pay for the financial rewards.\n‘Having said that’ is used to show contrast -e.g ‘The salary is very low. Having said that, it is still a good job.’\n‘Apart from that’ is used to show contrast - e.g. ‘Apart from the low salary, it is still a good job.’\nUse ‘In addition’ to\nLanguage of cause and effect: As a result / Because of this / For this reason\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAlthough ‘one’ can be used as a personal pronoun to refer to ‘people in general’, this include you yourself.\n\n\nFame undoubtedly changes a person’s life. Nevertheless, such changes are not aways for the better. In fact, for all professions, from movie stars to sports personalities, becoming a celebrity has challenges as well as benefits.\nUndoubtedly, fame can be extremely rewarding. Firstly, there is the sense of personal fulfillment that must come from making your family proud of what you have achieved. Secondly, celebrities can reap enormous financial rewards from their fame. On top of their fees, the famous have the potential to earn huge amounts of money from promoting luxury brands. This type of wealth is possible because celebrities are often seen as role models, and so people want to copy them and buy what they have. Therefore, being a focus for the world’s attention can be extremely lucrative.\nHowever, achieving this status is not without its problems. First, celebrities can no longer live a normal live. If they visit public places, such as malls and bars, people will crowd around them demanding a picture or an autograph. To avoid this, the famous are forced to live in gated communities, visit the most expensive restaurants and hotels, and hire personal body guards for themselves and their families. Second, being a public figure means that your life is like an open book. The public love to gossip about the lives of celebrities, so it is almost impossible for them to have any privacy. Thus, the famous alternative between experiencing isolation and extremely invasive attention.\nTo sum up, while it is true that fame brings huge financial benefits, there are even more significant drawbacks. In my view, only those who successfully manage the problems associated with fame can truly be said to reap its rewards."

Overall, this is a largely mechanical process comprising two main stages: preparing the raw wool and converting it into yarn and finished goods.\nThe first stage of the process is shearing, which can be done by hand and is a vital step in obtaining the raw material. This is followed by cleaning to eliminate impurities and drying to remove excess moisture. While high-quality wool is separated for further processing, lower-quality wool is set aside for recycling. The wool is then compacted into tufts, which are arranged and stored for the next stage.\nThe second stage is mainly mechanical and involves four steps. First, the stored wool is dyed in desired colors. The dyed wool is then placed in a spinning machine and spun into balls of yarn. Finally, the yarn is either knitted into textiles or manufactured into products such as jackets and carpets.\n\nThe diagram illustrates how wool is obtained from sheep and processed into a variety of products. Overall, the procedure consists of two main stages: preparing the raw wool and converting it into yarn for the production of textiles and garments.\nIn the first stage, sheep are shorn to obtain the fleece, a process which can be carried out manually. The raw wool is then thoroughly cleaned to remove dirt and other impurities before being dried to eliminate excess moisture. At this point, the fleece is graded: the finer wool is selected for further processing, while the lower-quality material is recycled. The usable wool is then compacted into tuffs and shored for later use.\nThe second stage is largely mechanical. The tufts are first dyed in a range of colors and subsequently spun in machines to produce balls of yarn. This yarn is either knitted into fabric or manufactured into finished goods such as jackets and carpets.\n\nLonger:\nThe diagram illustrates the process through which wool is obtained from sheep and converted into a range of products. Overall, it is a linear and partly mechanical procedure that can be divided into two broad stages: the preparation of raw fleece and the transformation of this material into yarn and finished items.\nThe process begins with the shearing of sheep, during which the fleece is removed by hand. This raw material then undergoes a series of treatments: it is carefully washed to eliminate dirt and grease, and subsequently dried to remove excess moisture. At this point, the wool is graded. While fine-quality fibres are selected for production, lower-quality portions are recycled rather than discarded. The usable wool is then compacted into tufts, which are systematically arranged and kept in storage until further processing.\nIn the second stage, the tufts are first dyed in a variety of colours. They are then fed into a spinning machine, where they are twisted at high speed into balls of yarn. This yarn can be knitted into fabric for textiles, or alternatively manufactured into a range of end products, including jackets for clothing and carpets for domestic use.\nother essay:\nThe diagram outlines the intricate process of converting raw wool from sheep into various finished products such as jackets, carpets, and knitted items for personal or industrial use. Overall, the procedure involves a series of well-defined stages, from shearing and cleaning to dyeing and final crafting, with notable emphasis on recycling excess materials.\nIn terms of the initial stages, the process begins with shearing wool from the sheep, a vital step to obtain raw material. This is followed by cleaning to eliminate impurities and drying to ready it for subsequent stages. The processed wool is then compacted into tufts and stored to maintain a consistent resource flow.\nTurning to the remaining phases, the stored tufts are dyed to introduce vibrant colors, enhancing their visual appeal. Next, the wool is separated into finer threads and spun into yarn using spinning balls. The yarn is subsequently either knitted into textiles or further crafted into jackets and carpets. Interestingly, surplus material from the separation stage is recycled, reflecting an eco-friendly approach in the process.\n\n\n\n2 IELTS Process Task 1 Template (180–220 words)\n\n2.0.1 1.

Overall, the linear process comprises four main stages, beginning with making pulp from used paper and ending with producing recycled paper.\nFirstly, used paper is transported by a conveyor belt. After that, chemicals and water are used to break down paper into pulp. After this stage, it will be passed through a filter to remove contaminants.\nNext, the filtered pulp is cleaned by air, water, and soap before passing through water and chemicals. Clean pulp is moved by conveyor belt to paper-making machine. Finally, it will be passed through heated rollers to remove paper before being rolled and ready to use.\n\nThe diagram illustrates how recycled paper is produced. Overall, the process is linear and involves four main stages, beginning with the creation of pulp from waste paper and ending with the production of new paper.\nIn the first stage, used paper is placed on a conveyor belt and mixed with water and chemicals to form pulp. This mixture is then passed through a filter, which removes any contaminants.\nOnce filtered, the pulp undergoes a cleaning stage. Here, it is treated with air, water, and further chemicals to ensure that impurities are eliminated. The cleaned pulp is then transferred by conveyor belt to a paper-making machine, where it is pressed between heated rollers to remove excess water, after which the recycled paper is rolled and made ready for use.\n(128 words)\nThe diagram illustrates the process involved in the production of recycled paper. Overall, the procedure is linear and consists of four distinct stages, starting with the conversion of waste paper into pulp and ending with the manufacture of new rolls of paper.\nIn the initial stage, discarded paper is placed on a conveyor belt and combined with water and chemicals, which break it down into pulp. This pulp mixture is subsequently passed through a filter in order to remove contaminants such as plastic or staples.\nAt the next stage, the filtered pulp undergoes a cleaning process. It is treated with are, water, and soap, before additional chemicals are applied to ensure that any remaining impurities are eliminated. Once this cleaning is complete, the pulp is transferred by conveyor belt to a paper-making machine. Here, it is pressed between heated rollers to remove excess moisture. Finally, the recycled paper is rolled into large sheets, ready to be distributed for reuse."

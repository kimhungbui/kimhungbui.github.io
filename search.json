    "text": "III. Core Concepts in Inference\n\n1. Point Estimation\n\nConcept:\nA point estimator is a function of the data, denoted as\n\\[\n\\hat{\\theta}_n = g(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n)\n\\]\nused to provide a single “best guess” for the unknown parameter \\[\\theta\\].\nKey Properties:\n\nBias:\n\\[\n\\text{bias}(\\hat{\\theta}_n) = E(\\hat{\\theta}_n) - \\theta\n\\]\nVariance and Standard Error (se):\n\\[\n\\text{se} = \\sqrt{Var(\\hat{\\theta}_n)}\n\\]\nMean Squared Error (MSE):\n\\[\n\\text{mse} = E\\left[(\\hat{\\theta}_n - \\theta)^2\\right] = \\text{bias}^2(\\hat{\\theta}_n) + Var(\\hat{\\theta}_n)\n\\]\nConsistency:\nAn estimator is consistent if\n\\[\n\\hat{\\theta}_n \\xrightarrow{P} \\theta \\quad \\text{as } n \\to \\infty\n\\]\nAsymptotic Normality:\nMany estimators satisfy\n\\[\n\\frac{\\hat{\\theta}_n - \\theta}{\\text{se}} \\approx N(0, 1)\n\\]\nfor large samples, which facilitates the construction of confidence intervals.\n\n\n\n\n2. Confidence Sets\n\nConcept:\nA confidence interval (or set) is a range constructed from the data that, over many repetitions of the experiment, contains the true parameter \\[\\theta\\] with a specified probability (coverage).\nExample (Normal-Based Interval):\nWhen \\[\\hat{\\theta}_n\\] is approximately normally distributed, an approximate \\[1-\\alpha\\] confidence interval is: \\[\nC_n = \\left( \\hat{\\theta}_n - z_{\\alpha/2}\\,\\text{se}, \\quad \\hat{\\theta}_n + z_{\\alpha/2}\\,\\text{se} \\right)\n\\] where \\[z_{\\alpha/2}\\] is the quantile of the standard Normal distribution such that \\[\nP(Z &gt; z_{\\alpha/2}) = \\frac{\\alpha}{2}.\n\\]\n\n\n\n3. Hypothesis Testing\n\nConcept:\nHypothesis testing involves formulating a null hypothesis \\[H_0\\] (a default statement, such as a coin being fair) and an alternative hypothesis \\[H_1\\], then using the data to decide whether there is sufficient evidence to reject \\[H_0\\].\nExample (Testing Coin Fairness):\n\\[\nH_0: p = 0.5 \\quad \\text{versus} \\quad H_1: p \\neq 0.5\n\\]\nProcess:\n\nDefine an appropriate test statistic (e.g., \\[T = |\\hat{p}_n - 0.5|\\])\n\nSet a significance level \\[\\alpha\\]\n\nDetermine the rejection region based on \\[\\alpha\\] or compute a p-value\n\nReject \\[H_0\\] if the test statistic falls into the rejection region"

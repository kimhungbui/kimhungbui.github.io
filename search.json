Let the associated PDF be \\[f = F'\\].\nObjective:\nEstimate the PDF \\[f\\]. However, unlike the CDF, estimating the density function nonparametrically is not possible under the sole assumption that \\[F\\] is any CDF.\n\n\n\n7.2 Need for Additional Assumptions\n\nIll-Posed Without Smoothness:\nThe space of all CDFs (denoted by \\[\\mathcal{F}_{\\text{ALL}}\\]) is too vast; a generic CDF need not be differentiable. Even if a density exists, it can be highly irregular, making consistent estimation difficult or impossible.\nIntroducing Smoothness via Sobolev Spaces:\nTo estimate \\[f\\] reliably, we assume that \\[f\\] belongs to a more restricted function class. One common assumption is that \\[f\\] lies in a Sobolev space (denoted by \\[\\mathcal{F}_{\\text{SOB}}\\]).\nFor instance, one might assume: \\[\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\text{SOB}} = \\left\\{ f \\in \\mathcal{F}_{\\text{DENS}} : \\int \\left(f^{(s)}(x)\\right)^2 dx &lt; \\infty \\right\\},\n\\] where:\n\n\\[\\mathcal{F}_{\\text{DENS}}\\] is the set of all probability density functions.\n\\[f^{(s)}(x)\\] denotes the \\[s\\]-th derivative of \\[f\\].\nThe condition \\[\\int \\left(f^{(s)}(x)\\right)^2 dx &lt; \\infty\\] ensures that \\[f\\] is not “too wiggly” or irregular.\n\n\n\n\n7.3 Estimation Methods\n\nKernel Density Estimation (KDE):\nWith the smoothness assumption in place, methods such as kernel density estimation can be employed. A kernel density estimator has the form: \\[\n\\hat{f}_n(x) = \\frac{1}{nh} \\sum_{i=1}^n K\\left(\\frac{x - X_i}{h}\\right),\n\\] where:\n\n\\[K(\\cdot)\\] is a smooth kernel function (e.g., Gaussian).\n\\[h\\] is a bandwidth parameter that controls the smoothness of the estimate.\n\n\n\n\n7.4 Why These Assumptions are Necessary\n\nRegularization:\nThe smoothness condition imposed by the Sobolev space helps regularize the estimation problem. It restricts the set of possible densities to those that have bounded variation or a controlled number of oscillations.\nImproved Convergence:\nSmoothness assumptions lead to better convergence properties of the density estimator, allowing for rates of convergence that can be rigorously analyzed.\nPractical Feasibility:\nIn many real-world scenarios, the underlying density is indeed smooth (e.g., physical phenomena, economic variables), making this assumption both realistic and useful."

In the past, a comedian or musician might work for years honing their craft in order to get a slot on one of the few talkshows and then become famous overnight. Nowadays, many celebrities start on reality TV or a YouTube channel and do not have any discernible talents. The socialite Paris Hilton was one of the first to take advantage of her wealth who through dating celebrities and canny use of social media and television was able to become a celebrity in her own right.\nDespite the aforementioned cases, this is on a whole a positive trend because of the more diverse range of famous people today. Fame used to be the prerogative of white men and women, with the occasional exception from an ethnic group. One of the reasons for this is that whites typically come from more privileged backgrounds and have greater opportunities, thereby making up a disproportionate share of success stories. The internet in particular has leveled the playing field to an extent. Anyone with a smartphone today has the ability to broadcast their talents and cultivate a loyal fanbase, regardless of gender or ethnicity and without the barriers that existed in the past such as ingrained reluctance from authority figures to give certain ethnicities an honest chance.\nIn conclusion, there are clear cultural drawbacks to the ease with which many achieve fame but today it is nonetheless more inclusive. A greater concern should be the age at which people become famous as it can have developmental side effects.\nChatGPT:\nIn today’s digital age, becoming famous is easier than ever due to the explosion of online platforms and television opportunities. While some see this as a democratization of fame, it is, in reality, a negative development that has diminished the value of talent, effort, and cultural depth.\nFame today is often disconnected from genuine ability. In the past, achieving celebrity status typically required years of dedication to a particular craft. A musician, for instance, might have spent decades perfecting their skills before getting a rare shot on a major talk show. This long road filtered out the mediocre and ensured that fame reflected a certain level of excellence. By contrast, many modern celebrities rise to prominence through reality TV or social media, sometimes without any identifiable talent. Paris hilton is prime example, became a household name not because of any specific talent, but because of her social status and media presence. Similarly, Kim Kardashian built a brand through strategic use of television and social media, not through traditional artistic or professional success.\nThis shift also sends a harmful message to younger generations: that fame can be achieved without effort or substance. As a result, more people may value visibility over personal development or hard work. In previous decades, fame was generally linked to expertise or originality - actors, musicians, writers, and athletes were admired for what they did, not just who they were. Today, however, social media influencers can gain millions of followers by simply being entertaining or attractive online. This can create unrealistic aspirations and encourage superficiality. Furthermore, the psychological impact of sudden fame, especially among young people, cannot be ignored. Many find themselves under intense pressure to maintain their online image, which can lead to mental health challenges such as anxiety, stress, and loss of identity.\nIn conclusion, although more people now have the opportunity to become famous, the way fame is achieved today often undermines the importance of talent, discipline, and meaningful contribution. This is a negative development that not only lowers cultural standards but also risks harming individuals who are unprepared for the realities of public life. Rather than celebrating fame for its own sake, society should place more value on substance and long-term achievement.\n\n\nIn today’s digital age, becoming famous is easier than ever due to the explosion of online platforms and television opportunities.

    "text": "Analysis\nAdvantages of Private Health Care: - Efficiency and shorter Waiting Times: Private hospitals offer quicker services compare to public hospitals, where long waiting lists are common. - Better facilities and advanced technology: Many private health institution provide cutting-edge medical technology, specialized treatments, and higher standards of care. - Greater Patient Choice: Individuals can select their preferred doctors, hospitals, and treatment plans, leading to more personalized care. Disadvantages of Private Health Care: - High costs and Limited Accessibility: Private health care is expensive, making it inaccessible for low-income individuals who cannot afford quality treatment. - Profit-driven System: The focus on profit can sometimes lead to unnecessary medical procedures, overcharging, or prioritizing financial gain over patient well-being. - Health inequality: A reliance on private health care can widen the gap between the rich and the poor, as only those who can afford it receive top-tier medical services. ## Sample essay Health care is an essential service, yet private medical facilities often make it unaffordable for many individuals. While private health care offers significant advantages such as efficiency, superior technology, and greater patient choice, it also has considerable drawbacks, particularly its high costs and contribution to social inequality. In my view, although private health care enhances medical standards, its disadvantages outweigh its benefits due to its exclusive and financial burden on ordinary citizens.\nOne of the key benefits of private health care is it efficiency. Unlike public hospitals, which often suffer from overcrowding and long waiting times, private institutions provide quicker access to medical attention. This is particularly crucial for emergency treatments or specialized procedures that require immediate intervention. Additionally, private hospitals invest heavily in advanced medical technology and modern infrastructure, ensuring high-quality treatment and specialized care. For instance, many private institutions offer robotic surgeries and personalized cancer treatments, which are not always available in public hospitals. Furthermore, private health care allows patients to choose their doctors and treatment plans, leading to a more personalized and comfortable experience.\nHowever, the drawbacks of private health care are significant. The most pressing concern is its exorbitant cost, making it unaffordable for a large portion of the population. Many life-saving procedures and medications are out of reach for lower-income individuals, forcing them to rely on overstretched public health systems. Furthermore, because private hospitals overate on a profit-driven model, there is a risk of unnecessary procedures being performed to maximize revenue, sometimes at the expensive of patient welfare. Lastly, the presence of an expensive private health care sector creates a divide between the wealthy and the poor, exacerbating health inequalities. In countries without strong public health care, the underprivileged often suffer from preventable diseases simply due to financial constraints.\nIn conclusion, while private health care provides high-quality services and efficiency, its high costs and potential for exploitation make it a less viable option for the general population. A well-functioning public health system remains crucial to ensuring that medical care is accessible to all, regardless of financial status. Governments should regulate private health care costs and prioritize investment in public health services to balance quality with accessibility."

Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparison where relevant.\nThe bar chart compares the number of tourists (in thousands) who visited two cities, Dover and Troy, across the four seasons: Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter.\nOverall, Dover saw a steady increase in tourist numbers throughout the year, peaking in winter, while Troy experienced the opposite trend, with numbers peaking in summer and then sharply declining by winter. The two cities demonstrated contrasting seasonal patterns in tourism.\nIn spring, both cities received a similar number of tourists, with Dover attracting 5,000 and Troy slightly fewer at 4,800. However, during the summer months, Troy saw a dramatic surge to 23,000 visitors, more than double Dover’s figures of 10,000. In autumn, while Troy has a slight decrease to 20,000 visitors, Dover hosts increasingly to 15,000 visitors.\nIn contrast, winter brought a complete reversal in patterns. Dover’s tourist numbers peaked at 25,000, while Troy experienced a steep decline, drawing only 5,000 visitors - the lowest for the year. This stark contrast highlights Dover’s strong winter appeal and Troy’s reliance on summer tourism."

Should be:\n✅ “300,000 and 150,000 new houses built”\n\n\n1 Rewritten Version (Band 7.5-8 model)\nThe number of new residential constructions in the South and the West dropped steadily between 2006 and 2012. In 2006, approximately 900,000 new houses were built in the South, while the West recorded about 450,000. These figures fell significantly by 2008, reaching 450,000 and 200,000 respectively. Between 2008 and 2010, the decline continued, though more gradually, with the numbers dropping to 300,000 in the South and 150,000 in the West. However, by 2012, there was a slight increase, with around 310,00 homes constructed in the South and 160,000 in the West.\n\n\n2 Higher band version\nBetween 2006 and 2012, the number of new residential constructions in both the South and the West declined overall, though with minor fluctuations. In 2006, the South recorded approximately 900,000 new homes, while the West saw about half that figure at 450,000. By 2008, these numbers had dropped significantly to 450,000 in the South and 200,000 in the West. The downward trend continued more gradually over the next two years, reaching 300,000 and 150,00 respectively by 2010. However, 2012 saw a slight recovery, with new constructions rising modestly to around 310,000 in the South and 160,000 in the West.\n\nThe number of visitors to Dover increases overall throughout the year. In Spring, Dover recorded approximately 5,000 tourists. The Summer experiences a sharp climb to two times the figure of the before season. The upward trend continues more gradually over the next two seasons, reaching 15,000 in Autumn before having a peak at 25,000 in Winter.\n\n2.0.1 Coherence & Cohesion (Band 5.5–6)\n✅ You attempt a logical sequence: Spring → Summer → Autumn → Winter.\n❌ However, some sentence transitions are unnatural or slightly unclear.\n❌ Use of linking phrases like “before having a peak” is awkward and unidiomatic.\n\n\n2.0.2 Lexical Resource (Band 6)\n✅ Good attempt with words like “sharp climb,” “upward trend”\n❌ “two times the figure of the before season” → awkward and incorrect. Better:\n✅ “twice the number recorded in the previous season.”\n❌ “experiences a sharp climb” → Summer can’t “experience” something.\n✅ Use: “There was a sharp rise in summer…” or “The number increased sharply in summer.”\n\n\n2.0.3 Grammatical Range & Accuracy (Band 5–5.5)\n❌ “The Summer experiences” → incorrect article usage. Should be:\n✅ “In summer, the number rose sharply…”\n❌ “before having a peak” → ungrammatical. Try:\n✅ “before peaking at 25,000 in winter.”\n✅ You attempted complex structures, but several were awkward or incorrect.\nSample:\nThe number of visitors to Dover increased overall throughout the year. In Spring, the town welcomed approximately 5,000 tourists. This figure doubled in summer, rising sharply to 10,000. The upward trend continued at a more moderate pace, reaching 15,000 in autumn, before peaking at 25,000 in winter.\n\nEngineering was the dominant choice for male students, comprising 45% of their total enrollment, more than twice the proportion of females in the same field (20%). In contrast, only 10% of men choose Humanities, while this subject attracted 30% of women, three times higher. Similarly, Education accounted for 35% of female enrollment, compared to just 20% of men.\n🔍 Detailed Analysis\n🟦 1. Task Achievement (Band 7–8)\n✅ You cover key features and specific numbers.\n✅ You make comparisons between male and female enrollment.\n❌ Minor inconsistency in the final sentence — it’s Education that had 35% of women and 20% of men, which you got right, but the word “just” is too informal here.\n🟨 2. Coherence & Cohesion (Band 7)\n✅ Clear overall structure and logical flow: from Engineering → Humanities → Education.\n❌ “three times higher” is vague. It’s better to say: “three times the proportion” or “threefold that of men.”\n❌ Avoid “similarly” unless the comparison is parallel — Education and Humanities are different in structure.\n🟥 3. Lexical Resource (Band 7)\n✅ Good use of: comprising, proportion, attracted, accounted for.\n❌ Could vary with more formal phrases like:\n“enrolled in” instead of “choose”\n“constituted” instead of “accounted for”\n🟩 4. Grammatical Range & Accuracy (Band 7)\n✅ Mostly correct grammar and comparatives.\n❌ “Choose” → should be past tense: chose (as you’re describing a chart, not a general truth)\n❌ Minor article omission: “more than twice the proportion…”\nRewrite: Engineering was the most popular subject among male students, accounting for 45% of their total enrollment, which was more than twice the proportion of females in the same field (20%). In contrast, only 10% of men chose Humanities, compared to 30% of women - three times the male figure. Likewise, Education attracted 35% of female students, while just 20% of male students enrolled in this subject."

    "text": "In spite of the advances made in agriculture, many people around the world still go hungry. Why is this the case? What can be done about this problem? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own experience or knowledge. Write at least 250 words.\n\nRecent years have witnessed tremendous developments in agricultural science yet every day people all over the world continue to suffer and even die from hunger. In my opinion, this is because innovations rarely impact the developing world and the best solution for it is to direct humanitarian funding towards these advances.\nThe main cause of more advanced agricultural methods not reaching the people who need it the most is that the developing world has trouble implementing these methods. There are a number of reasons for this ranging from limited financial resources to poor existing infrastructure to political instability, depending on the country in question. One example of this would be in many African nations, where malnourishment has historically been highest. Countries like the Congo have seen revolution after revolution over the last several decades, which has effectively destabilized the entire country. The universities where students would learn about changes in agriculture are frequently shut down or destroyed. The young people who would become agricultural scientists end up drawn into the conflict as soldiers or victims. Long-term economic neglect means that the government has very limited ability to subsidies farming. These problems are present to varying degrees in countries around the world and offer one possible explanation for the continued prevalence of hunger.\nThe solution that I believe would be most effective is directing humanitarian funds previously focused on food aid towards education and agriculture. Food aid is a notoriously poor solution because it only offers an immediate solution and warlords often exploit it to support their continued mistreatment of their people. It hurts more than it helps. However, there would be better long-term effects if international organizations and governments redirects that money into helping build better farms, provide more modern equipment, and sending qualified professions to train people in need. There is a TedTalk by a young man in Kenya who built his own windmill out of old bicycle parts and reading a book in the local library. It is large enough to power irrigation channels for the entire village. If more people like him can be found or trained when this will have an impact that lasts for decades and is relatively impervious to the factors preventing agricultural advances from taking root in developing countries.\nIn conclusion, developing companies face myriad problems that hinder their ability to take advantage of newer agricultural models and we should direct more funding to helping these countries learn more about new farming methods. This is likely to be an important issue in the world as the gap between rich and poor, developed and undeveloped widens while technological progress continues its indifferent march forward.\n\n1 Key Academic Vocabulary\nNouns/nominalisations: developments, innovations, humanitarian funding, infrastructure, instability, malnourishment, subsidies, exploitation, irrigation, prevalence, technological progress\nVerbs: suffer, destabilize, implement, exploit, redirect, power, widen\nAdjectives/adverbs: tremendous, advanced, limited, poor, political, historical(ly), immediate, long-term, modern, qualified, relative(ly), impervious, indifferent\n\n\n2 Linking & Signposting Phrases\nContrast: yet, however, but\nCause/Reason: because, depending on, due to\nExample: one example (of this) would be\nCondition: if…, then…\nAddition/Sequence: and, also\nConclusion: in conclusion\n\n\n3 Grammar Structures\nComplex sentences with multiple clauses:\n“There are a number of reasons for this ranging from X to Y…”\n“The universities where students would learn… are frequently shut down.”\nRelative clauses: “countries where…”, “…methods that…”\nConditionals (first): “If more people like him can be found…, this will have an impact.”\nPassive voice: “are frequently shut down or destroyed.”\nNominalisation to pack information: “the continued prevalence of hunger.”\n\n\n4 Sentence-building Techniques\nTopic sentence → elaboration → example in each body paragraph\nBalance of simple/simple-compound sentences (“However, there would be better long-term effects…” vs. “It is large enough to power irrigation channels for the entire village.”)\nAbstract–Concrete pairing: stating a general problem then giving a vivid, specific case (Congo revolutions; Kenyan windmill)."

But when I do, I’d say the transport links in my area are decent.\n\n\nDo you enjoy shopping in your local area?\nYes, I do! There’s a brand new shopping mall that opened just a couple of months ago. It’s not too expensive either, so I can usually find something reasonable. I’ve definitely been going there more often lately.\n\n\nHow often do you travel for work or study?\nThese days, I only need to go into the city one or two days a week. Most of the time I work from home. I really appreciate that flexibility - it saves me time and money.\n\n\nDo you like your neighborhood?\nYes, I really like it. It’s a quite area with good transport links and a lovely park nearby. The school here is one of the best in the country, and we also have a great hospital. I’ve been living here for a few years, and I’ve never had any problems.\n\n\nDo you like going to the cinema?\nAbsolutely. There’s a brand new cinema in the city center - it’s only bene open a couple of months. I’ll definitely have a look this weekend. A friend told me it’s really modern and comfortable.\n\n\nDo you often meet friends in your free time?\nI try to. If they’re free after work, I could meet them for dinner or coffee. Thursday is usually better for me because I finish early. Really appreciate any time I get to catch up with them.\n\n\nDescribe a place in your local area that you like to visit.\nYou should say: - what the place is - where it is located - how often you go there - and explain why you enjoy going there\nOne place I enjoy visiting in my local area is a small park in the suburb where I live. It’s not a huge park, but it’s peaceful and well-kept, and I’ve been going there for years. The park is just a 10-minutes walk from my home, and it’s next to a lovely little cafe. You can’t miss it - it’s right opposite the new cinema that’s only been open a couple of months. I usually go there after work, maybe one or two days a week, just to unwind.\nWhat I love most is how quiet it is. There’s hardly any traffic around, and it’s never crowded. I go by bike, which is really convenient, and it’s a great way to get a bit of exercise. Sometimes I take a book and it on a bench, or just enjoy walking around.\nI think it’s only the best things about my neighborhood. It’s not too expensive to live here, the transport links are good, and places like this park make it even better. I really appreciate having a relaxing spot so close to home.\n\n\nDo you think it’s important to have public places in cities?\nAbsolutely. I think public places like parks or community centers are essential in cities. They offer people space to relax and socialize, especially in areas where most people live in apartments. For example, the park near my house isn’t too expensive to maintain, but it really adds value to the neighborhood. I’ve been going there for years, and it’s always full of life - families, joggers, even students reading under the trees.\n\n\nWhy do people prefer to go to parks rather than shopping centers?\nI think it depends on what they’re looking for. Parks are quiet and peaceful, and they’re usually free, while shopping centers can be noisy and crowded. A lot of people are put off by the idea of spending money every time they go out, so they prefer to visit a park instead. Personally, I go by bike to my local park - it’s great exercise and doesn’t cost a thing. You should be able to enjoy your free time without spending a lot.\n\n\nWhat are the benefits of having local amenities close to home?\nThere are so many benefits. First, it saves time. If there’s a good school or a hospital nearby, that’s one less thing to worry about. For instance, in my area, we have one of the best hospitals in the country, and I really appreciate having it so close. There’s also a brand new cinema that’s only been open for a couple of months. It’s nice to have everything within walking distance - you can definitely tell that people feel more connected to their community.\n\n\nHow has the use of public spaces changed in recent years?\nI think people are using public spaces more now, especially after the pandemic. There’s more focus on outdoor activities, mental health, and work-life balance. A lot of people work from home one or two days a week now, so they have more time to enjoy places like parks or cafes. It’s also become more common for local councils to invest in public areas because they’ve realized how much people value them."

I used to go to the gym, but honestly, fitting a visit into my busy day was a bit difficult. These days, I prefer cycling in the park. It’s fun, and being out in the fresh air really helps me relax. I also enjoy in because it keeps me fit without feeling like a chore.\n\n\nDo you prefer indoor or outdoor activities?\nI definitely prefer outdoor activities. I find going for a run or a bike ride much more enjoyable than being stuck in a gym. The fresh air and scenery make it feel less like exercise. But I”ll admit - if the weather’s bad, I skip it. Only real fanatics go out in the wind and rain!\n\n\nWhat do you think about personal trainers?\nI think they can be really helpful, especially for beginners. Having someone there to encourage you can help you achieve your goals can really boost motivation. The only downside is the cost - personal trainers can be expensive, and not everyone can afford that.\n\n\nDescribe a physical activity you enjoy.\n*You should say:\nwhat the activity is\nwhere and when you do it\nwho you do it with\nand explain why you enjoy it.*\nOne physical activity I really enjoy is swimming. I usually go to an indoor pool near my house, which means I can swim any time of year regardless of the weather. I often go after work, and sometimes my friend joins me.\nWhat I like most about swimming is that it’s great for building fitness, but it’s also quite gentle on the body. It works all the muscles without putting too much strain on the joints. That said, it can be a bit solitary - you can’t exactly have a chat while swimming laps!\nStill, I find it really relaxing and satisfying. It clears my mind and keeps me in shape. I’ve also set some small goals for myself, like increasing how many laps I can do, which helps me stay motivated.\n\n\nWhy do some people enjoy physical exercise more than others?\nI think it depends on their personality and past experience. Some people enjoy exercise because they’ve built a habit and can see the progress they’re making, which keeps them motivated. Others might find it hard because they don’t feel any improvement at first, so they lost interest and give up. Also, if someone isn’t very flexible or physically confident, even simple exercises like yoga can feel surprisingly challenging.\n\n\nDo you think people today get enough physical activity?\nHonestly, I don’t think most people do. Many lead very busy lives, and fitting a workout into their schedule can be tough. Even if they join a gym, they often stop going after a few weeks. It takes a lot of determination and commitment to keep exercising regularly, especially if you’re not seeing immediate results.\n\n\nWhat can people do to stay motivated to exercise regularly?\nOne effective way is to set manageable goals. If people aim too high at the beginning, they might feel overwhelmed and give up. Having flexible targets, rewarding yourself when you reach a goal, or even exercising with a friend can make it more enjoyable and sustainable. Getting a personal trainer can also help, but that comes with a significant cost.\n\n\nIs it better to do exercise indoors or outdoors?\nIt depends on personal preference. Some people enjoy running or cycling outdoors because it gives them a sense of freedom and they get to enjoy the fresh air. Others prefer the gym or indoor pools where the environment is controlled, especially during bad weather. Personally, I find outdoor exercise more refreshing, as long as the conditions are right - I’m definitely not a fan of running in the rain."

A while ago, I did a project where I experimented with natural dyes to colour fabrics like cotton and wool. It was quite hands-on - a real practical investigation - and even thought i was time-consuming, I found it fascinating.\n\n\nHave you ever made something by hand?\nActually, yes. I once made some natural dyes myself as part of a textile design project. I thought it would just be a matter of using a teaspoon or so, but I ended up needing a whole pile of beetroot just to get a bit of colour. It took longer than I expected, but i was worth it.\n\n\nDo you enjoy doing experiments?\nI do, especially when there’s a creative element involved. I remember doing an experiment with different types of fabric - like cotton, wool, and nylon - to see how they reacted to natural and artificial dyes. I’d been going to test just one fibre at first, but then I decided to include more for comparison.\n\n\nDo you often try new things?\nYes, I like following up on things that catch my interest. For example, I once visited an exhibition and saw a display of colorful textiles, which inspired me to research natural dyes. I even found a great book about a botanic garden that specialises in dye-producing plants.\n\n\nAre you interested in art of design?\nDefinitely. I love anything visual. I once studied a dye called Tyrian purple, which was worn in ancient times by royalty because it was so rare. I didn’t use it in my project, though - it would’ve cost a fortune.\n\n\nDescribe a project or piece of work you did, either at school or at home.\nYou should say: - what the project was\n\nwhy you did it\nhow you did it\nand explain how you felt about doing it\n\nOne of the most interesting projects I’ve ever done was a textile design assignment during my final year at university. I’ve always been interested in colour and design, so I chose to focus on how natural dyes could be used to color fabrics like cotton and wool. The idea actually came from a carpet shop I visited years ago when I was on holiday with my family in Turkey. I still remember all the amazing colours, and it really stuck with me. Later, I visited exhibition at a museum, and that gave me even more ideas. I decided to follow it up for my project. The project included a practical investigation, which meant I had to prepare and test various dyes on different types of fabric - cotton, wool, and nylon. At first, I was going to use just one fibre, but I changed my mind so I could make some comparisons. I used both ready-made dyes and homemade ones. For example, I tried using beetroot, but it was more difficult than I thought. I had to chop up a whole pile of it just to get a little bit of dye, and even then, the colour wasn’t as strong as I’d hoped. It ended up being a kind of watery cream shade on the wool, which was disappointing. Despite the challenges, I really enjoyed doing the project. It was creative, and I learned a lot - not just about fabrics, but also about how to plan and carry out an investigation. It took longer than I expected, but I felt proud of the final results.\n\n\nDo you think students learn more from doing projects or from traditional classes?\nI believe students often learn more from doing hands-on projects. When they’re actively involved in a practical investigation, like testing variables or creating something from scratch, they tend to remember the experience better. For example, when I made my own natural dyes for a design project, I ended up learning much more than I would have by just reading about the process in a textbook. It encourages creativity and independent thinking.\n\n\nWhat kind of projects are most beneficial for young people ?\nI think the most useful projects are the ones that combine creativity and real-world skills. For instance, projects that involve planning, researching, or experimenting with different materials can teach valuable problem-solving skills. If young people can follow up on something they’re genuinely interested in-whether it’s science, design, or business - they’re more likely to stay motivated and take ownership of their learning.\n\n\nShould schools focus more on academic subjects or creative activities?\nIdeally, there should be a balance. Academic subjects are important, of course, but creative activities help students develop other types of intelligence- like emotional awareness, visual thinking, or innovation. In my opinion, creative projects like art, music, or even textile design allow students to express themselves and discover talents they might not explore in regular academic classes.\n\n\nWhat challenges do people face when working on creative projects?\nOne big challenge is time. Creative projects often take longer than expected. I remember thinking that dyeing fabric with natural ingredients would be simple, but I ended up needing a whole pile of beetroot just to get a weak color. Another issue is uncertainty-you don’t always know what the outcome will be. That can be discouraging if things don’t go as planned, especially if the materials cost a fortune.\n\n\nWhy do some people give up on creative hobbies or projects?\nMany people stop because they don’t see quick results. It takes a lot of commitment and patience to stick with something that doesn’t turn out perfectly the first time. Some might also abandon their projects if they lack proper guidance. For instance, without a good mentor or tutor, it’s easy to feel lost. Also, creative work can be expensive-materials, tools, or even time investment can be hard to maintain. ## Recording 4\n\n\n\n2.3.4 Vocabulary and Phrases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWord / Phrase\nMeaning / Usage\n\n\n\n\ndozing under rocks\nLightly sleeping in a warm, sheltered place\n\n\nquite common\nFrequently found or seen in a region\n\n\ndistinctive\nEasily recognizable; unique or unusual\n\n\nin contrast with\nUsed to show a clear difference\n\n\nvaried diet\nA diet including different types of food\n\n\ncrush beetles and snail shells\nShows strong jaw strength (functional ability)\n\n\npredators\nAnimals that hunt or attack others\n\n\nman-made threat\nDangers caused by humans (e.g. traffic, pollution)\n\n\nmethods of navigation\nWays an animal finds its direction or location\n\n\nterritory\nArea an animal considers its home\n\n\nmonogamous\nHaving one mate at a time; forming long-term pair bonds\n\n\nreturning to the same partner\nBehavior of repeating a relationship over time\n\n\nprotecting their young\nLooking after or defending their offspring\n\n\nno evidence to support that idea\nNo data or proof to confirm a theory\n\n\ngive the female protection\nDefensive behavior in mating context\n\n\ncollecting data by tracking\nResearch method using technology to follow subjects\n\n\nfixed this onto their tails\nDescribes how GPS units were attached\n\n\nfar fewer meetings than expected\nResearch result that showed less interaction\n\n\nhypothesis\nA theory or idea not yet proven\n\n\nself-preservation\nBehavior intended to avoid harm or danger"

    "section": "",
    "text": "In the future all cars, buses and trucks will be driverless. The only people travelling inside these vehicles will be passengers.\nDo you think the advantages of driverless vehicles outweigh the disadvantages?\nA future filled with driverless vehicles is an inevitability. In my opinion, though there are concomitant moral risks, the practical import for health such a seismic shift will be positive on the whole.\nCritics of this trend suggest that machines should not be responsible for the potential loss of human life. This argument rests on the fact when there is an accident involving humans, it is possible to either assess blame and assign punishment or accept that human error played a role. In contrast, an individual severely injured as the result of a collision caused by a machine may justly feel that all human autonomy and free will is absent from their fate. This is analogous to a natural disaster with the crucial distinction being that humanity has engineered the situation. It is human nature to prefer to control a situation rather than surrender the outcome to an autonomous machine.\nProponents of automated vehicles, on the other hand, argue the tangible ramifications concerning public safety. The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that driverless vehicles cause fewer accidents than humans. The reason for this is that humans are prone to errors related to fatigue, distractions such as smartphones, and, in some cases, altered states. Machines might experience the occasional technical error, however, they are far more consistent by comparison. In fact, the few accidents that have occurred with automated vehicles were the fault of human drivers. If all cars were driverless, this would enabled a greater\n\nIn the coming years, it is predicted that all vehicles, including cars, buses, and trucks, will operate autonomously without human drivers. While this development may raise some concerns, I firmly believe that the advantages of driverless transportation far outweigh the disadvantages.\nOne major advantage of autonomous vehicles is improved road safety. The majority of traffic accidents today are caused by human error, including distracted driving, fatigue, and impaired judgment. Driverless vehicles, on the other hand, rely on advanced sensors, algorithms, and machine learning, which allow them to make precise decisions and maintain constant awareness of their surroundings, can process vast amount of data in real time and react faster than any human driver. This can greatly reduce accidents, save lives, and lower the burden on healthcare systems. In addition, driverless technology could improve traffic flow and reduce congestion by enabling vehicles to communicate and coordinate more efficiency.\nHowever, this transformation is not without drawbacks. A major concern is job loss among professional drivers, including taxi drivers, truckers, and bus operators. The widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles could lead to large-scale unemployment in these sectors. Moreover, ethical challenges arise in situations where a vehicle must choose between two harmful outcomes, raising questions about how machines should be programmed to make such decisions.\nDespite these issues, I believe that the long-term benefits are more compelling. The reduction in traffic accidents, the potential for greater mobility for elderly and disabled individuals, and the increase in productivity for commuters are all powerful advantages. With proactive government policies, including retraining programs and strong ethical guidelines for AI systems, the negative impacts can be mitigated.\nIn conclusion, although there are valid concerns about the rise of driverless vehicles, particularly regarding employment and ethics, the positive impacts on safety, efficiency, and accessibility make this a highly promising development. Therefore, I believe the advantages clearly outweight the disadvantages."

Here, the relative clause that sits in the center of the circle is describing the noun object; thus it is functioning as an adjective.\nThe chatterer provided no details in support of his statement, {which remained obscure in the mind of his listeners}.

    "text": "In the past, knowledge was contained in books. Nowadays, knowledge is uploaded to the internet. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?\nIt is a fact of modern life that most information today is store online, rather than in physical books as it was in the past. In my opinion, this is a negative despite its obvious conveniences.\nSupporters of this trend can point to the numerous ways knowledge kept online can be disseminated and used. Online information is almost universally accessible, narrowing socioeconomic differences in society and allowing for various conveniences. First of all, users can find relevant information on search engines from a wide range of sources including user-generated sites like Wikipedia to news outlets like The New York Times and academic journals as well. Once an individual locates the information they are looking for, it is also easier to search within that article, share it with others, have it wherever they go and store more than would be possible if it were a hard copy.\nNonetheless, storing information online encourages a dependence on computer technology that is harmful for the human mind. In the past, if a person wanted to research a given topic, they would have to check out a library book or talk with an expert. This process was much slower and open to the possibility of bias. However, it also meant that individuals were more conscientious and patiently learned from fuller, more nuanced sources. Nowadays, most people read short articles, hastily written to attract more clicks and generate advertising revenue. These tap into a fundamental human need to be constantly engaged and feeling pleasure. Over time, this has led to a generation addicted to devices, lacking the healthy habits engendered by careful research and study.\nIn conclusion, despite the handiness of online information, the impact on the human psyche makes this a negative trend on level. Individuals must themselves find ways to counter these potentially injurious effects.\nSample positive essay:\nIn the digital age, the migration of knowledge from physical books to online platforms has become a defining feature of global society. While critics argue that this shift undermines intellectual depth and fosters dependency, I firmly believe the advantages of accessible, dynamic, and. collaborative information far surpass its drawbacks.\nProponent of online knowledge store emphasize its unparalleled capacity to democratize information. Unlike traditional books, which are more constrained by physical availability and cost, digital platforms grant instantaneous access to vast repositories of data for anyone with an internet connection. Students in remote villages, for instance, can now access lectures from Ivy League universities, download academic journals, or participate in global forums - opportunities once reserved for the socioeconomically privileged. Moreover, search engines and algorithms allow users to pinpoint precise information within seconds, a task that previously required hours of library search. The integration of multimedia - such as video, interactive graphs, and hyperlinks- further enriches understanding, catering to diverse learning styles. Crucially, digital storage eliminates the environmental toll of paper production, reducing deforestation and carbon emissions linked to printing and distributing physical books.\nDetractors, however, contend that the internet fosters misinformation, distraction, and superficial engagement. While valid, these concern are not insurmountable. It is true that unverified content proliferates online, yet this issue is counterbalanced by the rise of fact-checking tools, peer-reviewed databases, and digital literacy programs that empower users to discern credible sources. Similarly, although the constant influx of notifications and bite-sized content risks fragmenting attentions spans, individuals and educators can cultivate disciplined usage through structured learning frameworks and mindfulness practices. The digital divide-limited internet access in impoverished regions - remains a challenge, yet global initiatives to expand connectivity, such as satellite internet projects and affordable mobile data, are steadily bridging this gap.\nIn conclusion, the transition to online knowledge storage represents a net positive for humanity. Its capacity to democratize education, enhance efficiency, and promote sustainability far outweighs manageable risks like misinformation and distraction. To maximize benefits, society must prioritize digital literacy and equitable access, ensuring the internet remains a force for collective progress.\n\nSpeaking\n\nHow often do most people use the internet? Most people use the internet daily, if not constantly. Smartphones and Wi-Fi have made it ubiquitous whether for work, social media, or streaming. For instance, younger generations might spend 6+ hours online, while older adults might use it less frequently but still rely on it for news or banking.\nAre there drawbacks to its overuse? Absolutely. Overuse can lead to addiction, reduced productivity, and mental issues like anxiety or loneliness. Physically, screen time strains eyes and disrupts sleep. Socially, it erodes face-to-face interactions - think of families ignoring each other to scroll through phones. Moderation is key.\nWhat kind of information can people find online? Virtually anything. From academic research on Google Scholar to DIY tutorials on Youtube, and even niche forums discussing obscure hobbies. However, misinformation is rampant too - fake news, biased articles, or conspiracy theories. Critical thinking is essential to navigate this flood of data.\nHow was this changed the way people get their information? It’s deepen integration into daily life. Think smart homes controlled via apps, AI-driven healthcare consultations, or virtual reality workspaces. However, privacy concerns will grow, and the digital divide may widen unless access becomes universal. Education and jobs will increasingly depend on digital literacy."

However, the latter category undertook by far the most housework, while men with full-time jobs did comparatively little.\nUnemployed women led throughout the period in terms of hours, at a peak of 7 hours in 1985 and 2005 and a slight dip to 6.5 hours in between. In contrast, men with full-time work were unchanged at just 1 hour in 1985 and 1995, though there was a slight rise to 1.5 hours in 2005.\nWomen with part-time employment were slightly lower than their unemployed counterparts throughout the period, beginning at 5.3 hours in 1985, before declining to 5 hours over the next 5 years, and then finishing the period with a surge to 6 hours.

    "text": "Part 3\n\nDo you think tidiness is important in the workplace? Absolutely. A tidy workplace not only creates a more professional image but also boosts efficiency. When things are organized, it’s easier to find what you need, which saves time and reduce stress. Moreover, a clean environment can promote better focus and even improve team morale.\nWhy do some people struggle to stay tidy? There could be a few reasons. Some people simply lead very busy lives and don’t prioritize tidiness, while others may not have developed habits of organization from a young age. In some cases, people might not even notice the mess around them - they’ve grown accustomed to it. For a few, it could also be tied to mental health challenges, like anxiety or ADHD, which can effect one’s ability to maintain order.\nHow can parents teach children to be tidy? The most effective way is by setting a good example. If children see their parents consistently keeping things organized, they’re more likely to adopt those habits themselves. It also helps to make tidying part of a daily routine and turn it into something fun or rewarding - for instance, though games or praise. Teaching them to take pride in their space can go a long way.\nDo you think technology helps people stay more organized and tidy? Definitely. There are so many apps and digital tools now that can help people manages their time, declutter digitally, and keep track of tasks or schedules. Even simple things like calendar reminder or to-do list apps can encourage tidier habits. That said, technology can also contribute to digital clutter if not used mindfully.\nIs there a difference in tidiness between younger and older generations? In some ways, yes. Older generations often place a high value on physical tidiness, perhaps because they grew up in a time when everything had to be done manually. Younger people, on the other hand, might prioritize digital organization - like keeping their phones or laptops neatly arranged. However, i think personal habits play a bigger role than age."

    "title": "Farm animals and Vegetables",
    "section": "",
    "text": "It has been suggested that primary children should learn how to grow vegetables and keep animals.\nDo the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?\nDavid Lang’s essay:\nSome today have argued that it would be a sensible policy to teach children how to farm and raise animals at school. In my opinion, though this would require enormous resources, it would be beneficial in terms of both physical and intellectual development.\nThose arguing against this proposal point out the resources needed. In order to implement such an ambitious programs, schools would firstly need land nearby where animals and crops be raised. This might be possible within a school’s pre-existing grounds, but there would still need to be significant investment in infrastructure. Schools would therefore have to reallocate a significant portion of their budget, potentially reducing the money for crucial facilities, staff, and teaching resources.\nHowever, the advantages for the holistic development of children is overwhelming. Students today spend more time than ever before passively using technological devices. By spending more time outdoors learning about animals and crops, students will better understand their position within the natural food chain. Overtime, this may lead them to adopt environmentally friendlier, compassionate lifestyle choices such as becoming vegetarians or shopping locally rather than buying from large chains. Moreover, the work outdoors would necessarily involve physical exercise. Since obesity is a growing concern in most countries, this time outside could help to improve standards of physical fitness and establish healthy lifelong habits.\nIn conclusion, despite the money this reform would require, schools should adopt it when possible so as to achieve a more complete education for students. Governments should consider the long-term effects when deciding on such policies.\n\nChat gpt\nThe proposal to incorporate agricultural and animal husbandry education into primary school curricula has garnered attention. In my view, while such initiatives offer certain benefits, the potential drawbacks, particularly concerning resource allocation and health risks, are more significant.\nAdvocates highlight that engaging children in growing vegetables and caring for animals can foster responsibility and a connection to nature. These activities may enhance students’ understanding of food sources and promote environmental stewardship. However, implementing such programs requires substantial resources. Schools would need to invest in appropriate land, infrastructure, and trained personnel to oversee these activities. This financial commitment could divert funds from essential academic subjects, potentially compromising the quality of core education.\nMoreover, there are health and safety concerns associated with young children handling soil and animals. Exposure to allergens, zoonotic diseases, and physical injuries are risks that cannot be overlooked. Ensuring proper hygiene and safety measures would necessitate additional oversight and training, further straining school resources.\nIn conclusion, while teaching primary children to cultivate plants and care for animals has educational merits, the associated disadvantages, particularly in terms of resource allocation and health risks, outweigh the benefits. Schools should prioritize core academic subjects and consider integrating environmental education through less resource-intensive methods.\n💡 Why David Lang’s Essay Feels Simple but Scores High\n\nClear structure\n\nIntroduction: Directly paraphrases the question + gives a clear opinion.\nBody 1: Discusses the opposite view.\nBody 2: Presents his own view (which he supports).\nConclusion: Restates the opinion and wraps up.\n👉 Why it works: Examiners love clarity. They’re not grading you on how “fancy” your structure is — just that it’s logical and easy to follow.\n\nPrecise vocabulary, not fancy vocabulary\n\nHe uses natural, topic-specific language, like:\n“holistic development”\n“environmentally friendlier”\n“passively using technological devices”\n👉 Why it works: Band 9 vocabulary is about being accurate and appropriate, not sounding like a thesaurus.\n\nBalanced ideas + developed examples\n\nHe acknowledges the disadvantages (cost, resources) and then shows why advantages outweigh them (fitness, habits, awareness). He explains his points — not just states them.\n👉 Why it works: IELTS cares about depth more than how many ideas you list. One strong idea with support = better than five weak ones.\n\nGrammar is natural and controlled\n\nHe uses complex sentences when needed, not to show off.\n👉 Example:\n“Since obesity is a growing concern in most countries, this time outside could help…”\nThat’s complex, but clear. No over-complicated structures.\n✅ How YOU Can Write Like David Lang\n\nFollow a clean structure\n\nIntro: Paraphrase + opinion\nBody 1: Opposing view\nBody 2: Your view (with examples)\nConclusion: Restate opinion\n\nUse precise, topic-relevant words\n\nLearn how to talk naturally about big topics (education, health, environment) with words that fit.\n\nDon’t list ideas — explain them\n\nPick 1–2 strong points per paragraph and expand with why, how, and an example.\n\nWrite like you’re explaining, not performing\n\nPretend you’re talking to a smart friend, not an examiner. Make it natural and reasoned, not robotic or flowery.\n✏️ Step 1: Write the Introduction\n✅ What we need:\nParaphrase the question\nGive a clear opinion\n🧠 Example:\nSome believe that it would be beneficial for young children to be taught farming skills at school. However, I believe that the drawbacks of such a policy outweigh the potential benefits.\n🔍 Why this works:\nIt’s short.\nClear opinion.\nNo fancy words. Just focused.\nWould you like to try writing your own version of the introduction before we move on?\nOr should we go ahead to Body Paragraph 1?"

    "text": "Parity invariance means that the number of times a position is flipped determines its final value. If a position is flipped an odd number of times, its value changes, but if it is flipped an even number of times, it stays the same.\nConsider the array [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1]. We start by flipping three consecutive elements to try and transform all 0s into 1s. First, flipping the subarray [0, 0, 1] at indices 1..3 changes the array to [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]. Then, flipping [0, 0, 1] at indices [3..5] gives [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1]. Finally, flipping [1, 0, 1] at indices [1, 0, 1] at indices 4..6 results in [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0].\nAt this point, we see that the 0s at positions 4 and 6 remain, and there is no way to flip them without also flipping the other elements. Since we can only flip three elements at a time, we cannot isolate these 0s in a way that allow us to change them to 1s. This happens because these positions were flipped an even number of times, so they retain their original value. Because of this parity constraint, the transformation is impossible."

Increased Variance\n\nMore variables increase the model’s sensitivity to small changes in data.\nA high-variance model may change dramatically with minor input changes.\n\n\n\n3. Curse of Dimensionality\n\nIn high-dimensional spaces, data becomes sparse.\nConcepts like distance, density, and similarity lose their meaning.\nMany algorithms (e.g., k-NN, clustering) perform poorly in high dimensions.\n\n\n\n4. Interpretability\n\nAdding more variables makes the model harder to interpret.\nThis is a problem in domains where transparency is important (e.g., medicine, finance).\n\n\n\n5.

Write its formulae.\nWhat statistical tests can be used to attest the significance of an interaction term?\n\n\n2.3.1 1. Definition of Interaction in Logistic Regression\nIn logistic regression, an interaction occurs when the effect of one predictor variable on the outcome depends on the level of another predictor variable.\nThis means the predictors do not act independently: the combined effect of two variables is not simply additive on the log-odds scale.\nExample:\nIf \\(X_1\\) is age and \\(X_2\\) is smoking status, an interaction term (\\(X_1 \\cdot X_2\\)) would capture how the effect of age on the probability of disease differs between smokers and non-smokers.\n\n\n\n2.3.2 2. Simplest Form of an Interaction\nThe simplest interaction involves two variables in a logistic regression model. The formula (on the log-odds scale) is:\n\\[\n\\log\\left( \\frac{p}{1 - p} \\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\beta_3 (X_1 \\cdot X_2)\n\\]\nWhere: - \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) are predictors - \\(X_1 \\cdot X_2\\) is the interaction term - \\(\\beta_3\\) captures the change in effect of \\(X_1\\) at different levels of \\(X_2\\)\nIf \\(\\beta_3 \\ne 0\\), there is a statistically significant interaction.\n\n\n\n2.3.3 3. Statistical Tests for Interaction Terms\nTo test whether the interaction term significantly improves the model:\n\na. Wald Test\n\nTests if \\(\\beta_3 = 0\\)\nBased on the standard error and coefficient\nCommonly used in software output (e.g., summary() in R or LogitResults in statsmodels)\n\n\n\nb. Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT)\n\nCompares:\n\nModel 1: with interaction term\nModel 2: without interaction term\n\nNull hypothesis: interaction term does not improve the model\nLRT is more robust than the Wald test, especially in small samples\n\nSteps: 1. Fit both models (with and without interaction) 2. Compute:\n\\[\n\\chi^2 = -2(\\log L_{\\text{reduced}} - \\log L_{\\text{full}})\n\\] 3. Compare with chi-square distribution (df = 1 for one interaction term)\n\n\nc. ANOVA (Analysis of Deviance)\n\nAlternative approach to compare nested models in logistic regression.\nOften used in R with anova(model1, model2, test = \"Chisq\")\n\n\n\n\n2.3.4 Note: Interaction and Information Theory\nIn the context of information theory, interaction terms in a model can be interpreted as capturing mutual information between predictor variables and their combined influence on the target.\n\n\n\n2.3.5 Interaction as Additional Information\nWithout an interaction term, a model assumes additivity: each predictor affects the outcome independently. However, if two variables jointly influence the outcome, then their interaction carries additional information beyond their individual effects.\nThis added value can be viewed as:\n\nExtra bits of information (in the sense of entropy reduction) gained by knowing the joint effect of variables\nMutual information between variables that is relevant to the response, not captured in their marginal contributions\n\n\n\n\n2.3.6 Impact on Model Performance\n\n1. Improved Predictive Power\n\nCaptures complex relationships\nLeads to better fit and generalization, if the interaction is real and not noise\n\n\n\n2. Reduced Residual Uncertainty\n\nReduces unexplained variation in the outcome\nAnalogous to decreasing entropy in the output distribution by incorporating more structure\n\n\n\n3. Better Feature Representation\n\nInteraction terms effectively encode feature combinations that correlate strongly with the outcome\nSimilar to feature engineering guided by information gain\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.7 Summary\nAdding interaction terms allows the model to capture dependency structures among variables that are meaningful to the target, thereby increasing the information the model has about the outcome. In information-theoretic terms, interactions reduce conditional entropy and increase mutual information between inputs and output."

    "text": "2.6 Problem 6:\nDescribe how in a logistic regression model, a transformation to the response variable is applied to yield a probability distribution. Why is it considered a more informative representation of the response?\n\n2.6.1 Logistic Regression: Transformation of the Response Variable\nIn logistic regression, the response variable is categorical (often binary), but the model must output continuous values to fit it using linear predictors. This is done by applying a logit transformation, and then its inverse—the logistic (sigmoid) function—to map outputs to probabilities.\n\n\n\n2.6.2 Step-by-Step Transformation\n\nLinear combination of predictors: \\[\nz = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\cdots + \\beta_k X_k\n\\]\nLogit transformation (link function): \\[\n\\text{logit}(p) = \\log\\left(\\frac{p}{1 - p}\\right) = z\n\\]\nInverse-logit (sigmoid) function to obtain probability: \\[\np = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}\n\\]\n\nThis maps any real-valued input \\(z \\in (-\\infty, \\infty)\\) into a valid probability \\(p \\in (0, 1)\\).\n\n\n\n2.6.3 Why This Is Informative\n\nProbabilistic output: Unlike hard class labels, logistic regression provides the estimated probability of belonging to a class, which gives more nuanced information.\nUncertainty awareness: Probabilities allow us to gauge confidence in predictions. For example, a prediction of 0.95 is more confident than 0.55.\nThreshold flexibility: You can choose decision thresholds based on the application (e.g., 0.5, 0.7) rather than being locked into fixed class predictions.\nSupports ranking and calibration: Probabilities are useful for ROC analysis, calibration, and expected loss minimization.\n\n\n\n\n2.6.4 Summary\nLogistic regression transforms the response variable through the logit link and uses its inverse to map model outputs to a valid probability distribution. This enables not only classification but also a more informative and interpretable representation of the predicted outcomes.\n\n\n2.6.5 Note: Pros and Cons of Output Transformations in Logistic Regression\nWhen transforming the response variable into a probability distribution, several methods can be used depending on the problem type. The most common are:\n\nSigmoid function — for binary classification\nSoftmax function — for multi-class classification\nClassic normalization — general scaling of outputs (less used in classification)\n\nBelow is a comparison of their pros and cons:\n\n\n\n2.6.6 1.

Classic Normalization\nDefinition: \\[\n\\text{normalized}(z_i) = \\frac{z_i}{\\sum_{j=1}^K z_j}\n\\]\nUse Case: Sometimes used as an approximation or in non-logistic models\nPros: - Simple and fast - Avoids exponentiation (numerically stable)\nCons: - Not guaranteed to produce valid probabilities unless all \\(z_i \\ge 0\\) - Can yield values outside [0, 1] if inputs are not positive - Lacks probabilistic interpretation unless additional constraints are applied\n\n\n\n2.6.9 Summary Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransformation\nBest for\nOutput Range\nSums to 1\nInterpretable Probabilities\nKey Limitation\n\n\n\n\nSigmoid\nBinary classification\n(0, 1)\nNo\nYes\nNot suitable for &gt;2 classes\n\n\nSoftmax\nMulti-class classification\n(0, 1)\nYes\nYes\nSensitive to outliers\n\n\nNormalization\nHeuristic scaling\nVaries\nPossibly\nNot always\nMay not yield valid probs\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Raw model outputs (logits)\nlogits = np.array([2.0, 1.0, 0.1])\n\n# 1.

This makes them easier to model with linear functions.\n\n\n\n2.8.11 Log-Odds (Logit): \\(\\log\\left(\\frac{p}{1 - p}\\right)\\)\n\nTransforms probabilities to the entire real line: \\((-\\infty, +\\infty)\\).\nLinear in model parameters — makes logistic regression a linear model in log-odds space.\nSymmetric: log-odds of 0 means \\(p = 0.5\\).\n\n\nThis transformation enables optimization with gradient-based methods and maintains interpretability via the inverse sigmoid function.\n\n\n\n\n2.8.12 Summary: Why use log-odds?\n\n\n\nRepresentation\nRange\nGood For\n\n\n\n\nProbability\n[0, 1]\nIntuition, interpretability\n\n\nOdds\n[0, ∞)\nRelative comparison\n\n\nLog-Odds\n(−∞, ∞)\nLinear modeling, optimization\n\n\n\nLog-odds give models a mathematically stable and interpretable way to reason about binary outcomes — especially for logistic regression.\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Probabilities from 0.01 to 0.99 (avoid 0 and 1 to prevent log(0))\np = np.linspace(0.01, 0.99, 500)\n\n# Compute odds and log-odds\nodds = p / (1 - p)\nlog_odds = np.log(odds)\n\n# Plotting\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(3, 1, figsize=(8, 10), sharex=True)\n\n# Probability\naxs[0].plot(p, p, color='blue')\naxs[0].set_ylabel(\"Probability (p)\")\naxs[0].set_title(\"Probability vs. Itself (Identity)\")\naxs[0].grid(True)\n\n# Odds\naxs[1].plot(p, odds, color='green')\naxs[1].set_ylabel(\"Odds (p / (1 - p))\")\naxs[1].set_title(\"Probability vs. Odds\")\naxs[1].grid(True)\n\n# Log-Odds\naxs[2].plot(p, log_odds, color='red')\naxs[2].set_ylabel(\"Log-Odds (log(p / (1 - p)))\")\naxs[2].set_xlabel(\"Probability (p)\")\naxs[2].set_title(\"Probability vs. Log-Odds\")\naxs[2].axhline(0, color='gray', linestyle='--')\naxs[2].grid(True)\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.8.13 Interpretation of the Plots\n\n\n2.8.14 Top Plot: Probability vs. Itself\n\nThis is the identity function, where the output equals the input.\nUseful to visualize the bounded linearity of probability values.\nRange is limited to [0, 1], which restricts direct use in linear models.\n\n\n\n\n2.8.15 Middle Plot: Probability vs. Odds\n\nOdds are computed as:\n\\[\n\\text{odds} = \\frac{p}{1 - p}\n\\]\nAs \\(p \\to 1\\), the odds grow rapidly (approaching ∞).\nAs \\(p \\to 0\\), the odds approach 0.\nNonlinear and asymmetric, making it difficult to model directly.\n\n\n\n\n2.8.16 Bottom Plot: Probability vs. Log-Odds (Logit)\n\nLog-odds are computed as:\n\\[\n\\text{log-odds} = \\log\\left(\\frac{p}{1 - p}\\right)\n\\]\nThe transformation is:\n\nSmooth\nSymmetric around \\(p = 0.5\\)\nLinear near \\(p = 0.5\\)\nMaps \\(p \\in (0, 1)\\) to \\((-\\infty, +\\infty)\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n2.8.17 Why Use Log-Odds?\nThe log-odds transformation allows:\n\nApplying linear models to binary classification.\nSmooth optimization using gradient descent.\nEasy interpretability: a one-unit increase in input causes a fixed increase in log-odds.\n\nThus, log-odds are the foundation of logistic regression, enabling a linear combination of inputs to model a probability through the sigmoid inverse."

retire from her childcare career in a few years (00:00:07).\nTim’s family achieved early retirement through a financial strategy known as FIRE, which involves drastically reducing spending, saving a large percentage of income, and investing the savings (00:00:20).\nTim first considered the idea of early retirement in 2006 and started saving money, cutting costs, and figuring out what matters to him and his family (00:00:53).\nWhen Tim and his wife started working towards early retirement, they had student loan debt and other financial issues, but they paid off their existing debt and then focused on reducing their spending (00:01:12).\n\n\n\n\n\nTo reduce their spending, Tim and his wife looked at their bills, such as their power bill, and found ways to lower them, such as changing to LED lightbulbs (00:01:48).\nThey also reduced their grocery bill by buying generic versions of products and making things from scratch, which often tasted better and saved them money (00:02:02).\nTim and his wife have a focused approach to spending, only eating out a couple of times a year, and making sure their spending is aligned with what matters to them (00:02:31).\nTim uses a phrase to help him avoid overspending, which is to ask himself if he really needs something and if he can solve a problem without spending money (00:02:53).\nTim and his wife have paid off their mortgage and car loans in advance, which has helped them in their retirement (00:03:23).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe individual has achieved extreme early retirement at the age of 39, with a significant amount of assets and no debt, and currently resides in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada, where housing costs are relatively low, with an average housing cost of around $278,000 (00:03:50).\nThe majority of their investments are in straightforward strategies, including exchange-traded funds that mirror major indexes, allowing for a simple and low-maintenance approach to managing their finances (00:04:01).\nDespite the simplicity of their investment strategy, they still experience worries about the stock market, but have trained themselves not to check it frequently, focusing instead on long-term performance rather than short-term fluctuations (00:04:11).\nInitially, they found the wild gyrations of the stock market to be psychologically challenging, and having a larger cushion would have been helpful for peace of mind (00:04:27).\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the downsides of early retirement is the unusual conversations with people who question their decision to retire at a young age, leading them to reframe their explanation to focus on pursuing a writing career (00:04:44).\nThey started a blog in 2006 to document their early retirement journey, which includes their doubts, learning experiences, and mistakes, and also wrote a book called “Three at Forty Five” to discuss the importance of happiness in early retirement (00:04:57).\nThe first year of early retirement was problematic, involving a major lifestyle change and a process of deprogramming themselves to realize they didn’t have to work as much, and instead focus on enjoyable activities (00:05:29).\nTo cope with the transition, they created to-do lists that included fun items, and have pursued various hobbies such as making their own wine and beer, playing Dungeons & Dragons, and creating terrain pieces (00:05:52).\n\n\n\n\n\nThey have been married for 19 years and have two sons, aged 14 and 11, and have taught them about money management, focusing on delayed gratification, saving, and responsible spending (00:06:23).\nThey gave their children an allowance from a young age and allowed them to spend it on whatever they wanted, teaching them valuable lessons about money management (00:06:47).\nA strategy was implemented to teach children the value of saving money by explaining that waiting to buy something now can lead to affording bigger things later, resulting in two kids who default to saving money without knowing what they’re saving for (00:07:17).\nA friend’s advice was taken to heart, which stated that kids are a constant drain on finances, but the expenses change as they age, and it’s essential to get used to it (00:07:43).\nA system was set up to take out cash every month for the kids and put it aside, which averaged out to the same amount of money over the course of the year, with the wife managing the cash flow to prepare for upcoming expenses like winter boots (00:07:49).\nRegistered education savings plans were saved for the kids’ college and university education, which was fully filled before leaving work, allowing the money to grow in interest (00:08:18).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe wife decided to continue working, which was factored into the plan, assuming she would work for a few more years to offset some of the spending and provide an extra cushion (00:08:50).\nA plan was written out in advance to prepare for potential stock market declines, including options like taking a loan or getting a part-time job, to help stay calm and rational during emotional times (00:09:28).\nHaving a written plan helped to prepare for a major stock market decline a year into retirement, which ultimately worked out well in the long run (00:09:08).\nIt’s recommended to write out an investment plan while calm and rational to prepare for potential future declines and have a clear plan of action (00:09:37).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe family’s current home is a daycare, which is quite spacious, and they plan to downsize in the long term, with any savings from lower taxes, water bills, and other expenses being used to offset potential losses (00:10:14).\nLiving in Canada provides benefits such as government-paid healthcare costs, which have been over-contributed to, covering basic healthcare costs, but not dental, prescription eyewear, or other expenses that are self-insured and paid out-of-pocket (00:10:40).\nGovernment benefits like the Canada Pension Plan and Old Age Security are factored into long-term plans, but with conservative assumptions, such as only one spouse collecting Old Age Security (00:11:05).\n\n\n\n\n\nA job at the local library was taken to work with great people, enjoy the work, and earn a supplemental income, which is used to fund extra activities, and has helped achieve a better work-life balance (00:11:30).\nReduced working hours have improved overall happiness, and retirement has provided extra time to focus on desired activities and spend quality time with family, particularly children (00:12:10).\n\n\n\n\n\nResources on early retirement, including Tim’s blog and book, are available in the video description for those interested (00:12:43)."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This is the task of assigning an input image one label from a fixed categories. This is one of the core problems in Computer Vision that, despite its simplicity, has a large variety of practical applications. Moreover, many other seemingly distinct CV tasks (such as object detection, segmentation) can be reduced to image classification.\nExample: In the image blow in image classification model takes a single image and assigns probabilities to 4 label {cat, dog, hat, mug}. Computer view a image as an one large 3-dimensional array of numbers. In this example, the cat image is 248 pixel wide, 400 pixel tall, and has three color channel Red, Green, Blue. Therefore, the image consists of \\(248 \\times 400 \\times 3\\) numbers, or a total of 297,600 numbers. Each number is an integer that ranges from 0 (black) to 255 (white). Our task is turn this quarter of a million numbers into a single label, such as “cat”. \nChallenges: Since this task of recognizing a visual concept (e.g. cat) is relatively trivial for human to perform, it is worth considering the challenges involved from the perspective of a CV algorithm. As we present list of challenges below.\n\nViewpoint variation: A single instance of an object can be oriented in many ways with respect to the camera.\nScale variation: Visual classes often exhibit variation of their size (size in the real world, not only in terms of their extent in the image)\nDeformation: Many objects of interest are not rigid bodies and can be deformed in extremes ways.\nOcclusion: The objects of interest can be occluded. Sometimes only a small portion of an object (as little as few pixels) could be visible.\nIllumination conditions: The effect of illumination are drastic on the pixel level.\nBackground clutter: The objects of interest may blend into their environment, making them hard to identify.\nIntra-class variation: The classes of interest can be often be relatively broad, such as chair. Their are many different types of these objects, each with their own appearance. \n\nA good image classification model must be invariant to the cross product of all these variations, while simultaneously retaining sensitivity to the inter-class variations.\n\nCross product of variations This refers to the combination of all possible variations (e.g. viewpoint, scale, deformation, occlusion, illumination, etc.) that can occur within a class. The term “cross production” here is metaphorical, inpsired by the mathematical concept of a Cartesian product, which generate all possible combinations of elements from multiple sets.\n\nExample: A chair might appear:\n\nRotate (viewpoint variation)\nPartially hidden (occlusion)\nUnder bright sunlight (illumination)\nWhile being non-rigid (deformation) The model must recognize it as a “chair” despite this complex combination of variations Invariance Requirement: The model must be invariant to these variations, meaning its prediction for a class should not change even when factors alter the object’s appearance.\n\n\nInter-class variation There are difference between distinct classes (e.g. chairs vs tables). A model must retain sensitivity to these differences to avoid confusing classes, even when they share superficial similarities.\n\nExample: A “stool” (class: chair) and a “small table” (class: table) might both appear at similar scales or under similar lighting. The model must distinguish them based on defining feature (e.g. height, presence of a backrest).\nSensitivity Requirement: The model must preserver discriminate features that separate classes, even when intra-class variations (e.g. deformation in chairs) are extreme. Data-driven approach: How might we go about writing an algorithm that can classify images into distinct categories? Unlike writing an algorithm for, for example, sorting a list of numbers, it is not obvious how one might write an algorithm for identifying cats in images. Therefore, instead of trying to specify what every one of the categories of interest look like directly in code, the approach that we will take is not unlike one we would take with a child: we’re going to provide the computer with many examples of each class and then develop learning algorithms that look at these examples and learn about the visual appearance of each class. This approach is referred to as a data-driven approach, since it relies on first accumulating a training dataset of labeled images. Here is an example of what such a dataset might look like:\n\n\n\nThe image classification pipeline We’ve seen that the task in Image Classification is to taken an array of pixels that represents a single image and assign a label to it. Our complete pipeline can be formalized as follows: - Input: Our input consists of a set of N images, each labeled with one of K different classes. We refer to this data as the learning set. - Learning: Our task is to use the training set to learn what every one of the classes looks like. We refer to this step as training a classifier, or learning a model. - Evaluation: In the end, we evaluate the quality of the classifier by asking it to predict labels for a new set of images that it has never seen before. We will then compare the true labels of these images to the ones predicted by the classifier. Intuitively, we’re hoping that a lot of the predictions match up with the true answers (which we call the ground truth)."

    "title": "Finetuning",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Finetuning is a process of adapting a model to a specific task by further training the whole model or part of the model. It is one of the three very common AI engineering techniques used to adapt a model to specific needs, alongside prompt engineering and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). While prompt-based methods like prompt engineering and RAG influence a model’s quality solely through inputs without modifying the model itself, finetuning adapts a model by adjusting its weights. Finetuning techniques are generally more complicated and require more data compared to prompt-based methods. However, they can significantly improve a model’s quality, latency, and cost. Adapting a model by changing its weights makes things possible that aren’t otherwise, such as adapting it to a new task it wasn’t exposed to during initial training.\nFinetuning is considered part of a model’s training process, specifically an extension of model pre-training. Training that happens after pre-training is referred to as finetuning, and it can take various forms. Chapter 2 discusses two types of finetuning: supervised finetuning and preference finetuning.\nThe goal of finetuning is to get a base model, which has some but not all of the necessary capabilities, to perform well enough for a specific task. Finetuning improves sample efficiency, meaning a model can learn the desired behavior with fewer examples than training from scratch. For instance, while training a model for legal question answering from scratch might require millions of examples, finetuning a good base model might only require a few hundred. Finetuning can enhance various aspects of a model, including its domain-specific capabilities (like coding or medical question answering) and safety, but it is most often used to improve the model’s instruction-following ability, especially to adhere to specific output styles and formats.\n\n1. When to Finetune:\n\nEnhancing domain-specific capabilities: If a model struggles with a specific domain (e.g., a less common SQL dialect or customer-specific queries), finetuning on relevant data can help.\nImproving instruction following and structured outputs: Finetuning is the most effective and general approach to get models to generate outputs in a desired format. While prompting is less reliable, finetuning a model on examples following the desired format is much more reliable. For certain tasks like classification, modifying the model’s architecture before finetuning by adding a classifier head can guarantee the output format.\nBias mitigation: Finetuning with carefully curated data can counteract biases present in the base model’s training data. For example, finetuning on data with female CEOs or texts authored by women/African authors can reduce gender and racial biases.\nDistillation: Finetuning a smaller model to imitate the behavior of a larger model using data generated by the larger model is a common approach called distillation. This makes the smaller model cheaper and faster to use in production.\nOptimizing token usage (historically): Before prompt caching, finetuning could help optimize token usage by training the model on examples instead of including them in every prompt, resulting in shorter, cheaper, and lower-latency prompts. Although prompt caching has reduced this benefit, finetuning still removes the limitation of context length on the number of examples used.\nExtending context length: Long-context finetuning requires modifying the model’s architecture and can increase the maximum context length, though it is harder to do and the resulting model might degrade on shorter sequences.\n\n\n\n2. Reasons Not to Finetune:\n\nPerformance degradation on other tasks: Finetuning for a specific task can sometimes degrade performance on other tasks.\nHigh up-front investment and continual maintenance: Finetuning requires significant resources, including acquiring high-quality annotated data (which can be slow and expensive) and ML knowledge to evaluate base models, monitor training, and debug.\nServing complexity: Once finetuned, serving the model requires figuring out hosting (in-house or API) and inference optimization, which is non-trivial for large models.\nPace of base model improvement: New base models are constantly being developed and may improve faster than a finetuned model can be updated.\nPrompting might be sufficient: Many practitioners find that after complaints about prompting’s ineffectiveness, refining the prompt experiment process shows that prompting alone can be sufficient."

    "text": "Benefits from containers\nContainers package applications. In different scenarios: ### Scenario 1: Works on my machine\nLet’s first take a closer look into what happens in web development without containers following the chain above starting from “Plan”.\nFirst we plan an application. Then our team of 1-n developers create the software. It works on one’s computer. It may even go through a testing pipeline working perfectly. We send it to the server and it does not work.\nThis is known as the “works on my machine” problem. The only way to solve this is by finding out what in tarnation the developer had installed on their machine that made the application work.\nContainers solve this problem by allowing the developer to personally run the application inside a container, which then includes all of the dependencies required for the app to work.\n\nYou may still occasionally hear about “works in my container” issues - these are often just usage errors. ### Scenario 2: Isolated environments\n\nWe have 5 different Python applications. We need to deploy them to a server that already has an application requiring Python 2.7 and of course none of our applications are 2.7. What do we do now?\nSince containers package the software with all of its dependencies, we package the existing app and all 5 new ones with their respective Python versions and that’s it.\nSometimes different parts of a system may change over time, possibly leading to the application not working. These changes may be anything from an operating system update to changes in dependencies.\n\nScenario 3: Development\nWe are brought into a dev team. They run a web app that uses other services when running: a Postgres database, MongoDB, Redis and a number of others. Simple enough, we install whatever is required to run the application and all of the applications that it depends on …\nWhat a headache to start installing and then managing the development databases on your own machine.\nThankfully, by the time we are told to do that we are already a Docker expert. With one command we get an isolated application, like Postgres or Mongo, running in our machine.\n\n\nScenario 4: Scaling\nStarting and stopping a Docker container has little overhead. But when we run our own Netflix or Facebook, we want to meet the changing demand. With some advanced tooling that we will learn about in parts 2 and 3, we can spin up multiple containers instantly and load balance traffic between them.\nContainer orchestration will be discussed in parts 2 and 3. But the simplest example: what happens when one application dies? The orchestration system notices it, splits traffic between the working replicas, and spins up a new container to replace the dead one."

Containers, on the other hand, share the host OS kernel and only package the application and its dependencies, resulting in a more lightweight and efficient solution.\nVMs provide strong isolation and are suited for running multiple OS environments, but they have a performance overhead and longer startup times. Containers offer faster startup, better resource utilization, and high portability across different environments, though their isolation is at the process level, which may not be as robust as that of VMs. Overall, VMs could be used for scenarios needing complete OS environments, while containers excel in lightweight, efficient, and consistent application deployment.\nDocker relies on Linux kernels, which means that macOS and Windows cannot run Docker natively without some additional steps. Each operating system has its own solution for running docker."

    "text": "Image and containers\nSince we already know what containers are it’s easier to explain images through them: Containers are instances of images. A basic mistake is to confuse images and containers.\nCooking metaphor:\nThink of a container as a ready-to-eat meal that we can simply heat up and consume. An image, on the other hand, is the recipe and the ingredients for that meal.\nSo just like how we need a recipe and ingredients to make a meal, we need an image and a container runtime (Docker engine) to create a container. The image provides all the necessary instructions and dependencies for the container to run, just like a recipe provides the steps and ingredients to make a meal.\nIn short, an image is like a blueprint or template and the building material, while a container is an instance of that blueprint or template.\n\nImage\nA Docker image is a file. An image never changes; we cannot edit an existing file. Creating a new image happens by starting from a base image and adding new layers to it. We will talk about layers later, but we should think of images as immutable, they can not be changed after they are created.\nList all of ours image with docker image ls\n$ docker image ls\n  REPOSITORY      TAG      IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE\n  hello-world     latest   d1165f221234   9 days ago      13.3kB\nContainers are created from images, so when we ran hello-world twice we downloaded one image and created two of them from the single image.\nWell then, if images are used to create containers, where do images come from? This image file is built from an instructional file named Dockerfile that is parsed when we run docker image build.\nDockerfile is a file that is by default called Dockerfile, that looks something like this\nFROM &lt;image&gt;:&lt;tag&gt;\n\nRUN &lt;install some dependencies&gt;\n\nCMD &lt;command that is executed on `docker container run`&gt;\nand is the instruction set for building an image. We will look into Dockerfiles later when we to build our own images.\nIf we go back to the cooking metaphor, as Dockerfile provides the instructions needed to build an image we can think of that as the recipe for images. We’re now 2 recipes deep, as a Dockerfile is the recipe for an image and an image is the recipe for the container. The only difference is that Dockerfile is written by us, whereas image is written by our machine based on the Dockerfile."

A DSU will have an operation to combine any two sets, and it will be able to tell in which set a specific element is. The classical version also introduces a third operation, it can create a set from a new element.\nThus the basic interface of this data structure consists of only three operations: - make_set() - create a new set consisting of the new element v. - union_sets(a, b) - merges the two specified sets (the set in which the element a is located, and the set in which the element b is located). - find_set(v) - return the representative (also called leader) of the set that contains the element v. This representative is an element of its corresponding set. It is selected in each set by the data structure itself (and can change over time, namely after union_sets call). This representative can be used to check if two elements are part of the same set or not. a and b are exactly in the same set, if find_set(a) == find_set(b). Otherwise they are in different sets.\nAs described on more detail later, the data structure allows us to do each of these operations in almost \\(O(1)\\) time on average.\nAlso in one of the subsections an alternative structure of a DSU is explained, which achieves a slower average complexity of \\(O(\\log n)\\), but can be more powerful than the regular DSU structure."

It will be pretty inefficient at first, but later we can improve it using two optimizations, so that it will take nearly constant time for each function call.\nAs we said, all the information about the sets of elements will be kept in an array parent.\nTo create a new set (operation make_set(v)), we simply create a tree with root in the vertex x, meaning that it is its own ancestor.\nTo combine two sets (operation union_sets(a, b)), we first find the representative of the set in which a is located, and the representative of the set in which b is located. If the representatives are identical, that we have nothing to do, the sets are already merged. Otherwise, we can simply specify that one of the representatives is the parent of the other representative - thereby combining the two trees.\nFinally the implementation of the find representative function (operation find_set(v)): we simply climb the ancestors of the vertex v until we reach the root, i.e. a vertex such that the reference to the ancestor leads to itself. This operation is easily implemented recursively.\nvoid make_set(int v) {\n    parent[v] = v;\n}\n\nint find_set(int v) {\n    if (v == parent[v])\n        return v;\n    return find_set(parent[v]);\n}\n\nvoid union_sets(int a, int b) {\n    a = find_set(a);\n    b = find_set(b);\n    if (a != b)\n        parent[b] = a;\n}\nHowever this implementation is inefficient. It is easy to construct an example, so that the trees degenerate into long chains. In that case each call find_set(v) can take \\(O(n)\\) time.\nThis is far away from the complexity that we want to have (nearly constant time). Therefore we will consider two optimizations that will allow to significantly accelerate the work."

On the left there is a tree, and on the right side there is the compressed tree after calling find_set(7), which shortens the paths for the visited node 7, 5, 3 and 2.\n![[DSU_path_compression.png]]\nThe new implementation of find_set is as follows:\nint find_set(int v) {\n    if (v == parent[v])\n        return v;\n    return parent[v] = find_set(parent[v]);\n}\nThe simple implementation does what was intended: first find the representative of the set (root vertex), and then in the process of stack unwinding the visited nodes are attached directly to the representative.\nThis simple modification of the operation already achieves the time complexity \\(O(\\log n)\\) per call on average (here without proof).

With this optimization we will avoid this by choosing very carefully which tree gets attached.\nThere are many possible heuristic that can be used. Most popular are the following two approaches: In the first approach we use the size of the trees as rank, and in the second one we use the depth of the tree (more precisely, the upper bound on the tree depth, because the depth will get smaller when applying path compression).\nIn both approaches the essence of the optimization is the same: we attach the tree with the lower rank to the one with the bigger rank.\nHere is the implementation of union by size:\nvoid make_set(int v) {\n    parent[v] = v;\n    size[v] = 1;\n}\n\nvoid union_sets(int a, int b){\n    a = find_set(a);\n    b = find_set(b);\n    if (a != b) {\n        if (size[a] &lt; size[b])\n            swap(a, b);\n        parent[b] = a;\n        size[a] += size[b];\n    }\n}\nand here is the implementation of union by rank based on the depth of the trees:\nvoid make_set(int v) {\n    parent[v] = v;\n    rank[v] = 0;\n}\n\nvoid union_sets(int a, int b) {\n    a = find_set(a);\n    b = find_set(b);\n    if (a != b) {\n        if (rank[a] &lt; rank[b])\n            swap(a, b);\n        parent[b] = a;\n        if (rank[a] == rank[b])\n            rank[a]++;\n    }\n}\nBoth optimizations are equivalent in terms of time and space complexity.

In fact it grows so lowly, that it doesn’t exceed 4 for all reasonable \\(n\\) (approximately \\(n&lt;10^{600}\\)).\nAmortized complexity is the total time per operation, evaluated over a sequence of multiple operations.

If there exists no such walk, the answer is -1.\nReturn the array answer, where answer[i] denotes the minimum cost of a walk for query i.\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 5, edges = [[0,1,7],[1,3,7],[1,2,1]], query = [[0,3],[3,4]]\nOutput: [1,-1]\nExplanation:\nTo achieve the cost of 1 in the first query, we need to move on the following edges: 0-&gt;1 (weight 7), 1-&gt;2 (weight 1), 2-&gt;1 (weight 1), 1-&gt;3 (weight 7).\nIn the second query, there is no walk between nodes 3 and 4, so the answer is -1.\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 3, edges = [[0,2,7],[0,1,15],[1,2,6],[1,2,1]], query = [[1,2]]\nOutput: [0]\nExplanation:\nTo achieve the cost of 0 in the first query, we need to move on the following edges: 1-&gt;2 (weight 1), 2-&gt;1 (weight 6), 1-&gt;2 (weight 1).\nConstraints:\n2 &lt;= n &lt;= 105\n0 &lt;= edges.length &lt;= 105\nedges[i].length == 3\n0 &lt;= ui, vi &lt;= n - 1\nui != vi\n0 &lt;= wi &lt;= 105\n1 &lt;= query.length &lt;= 105\nquery[i].length == 2\n0 &lt;= si, ti &lt;= n - 1\nsi != ti\n\n\nAnalysis\nLet’s determine when the answer to a query is -1. This happens when no walk exists between the two nodes, meaning they belong to different connected components.\nNow, suppose the two nodes belong to the same connected component. What is the minimum cost of a walk connecting them? As mentioned, the optimal walk includes as many edges as possible. Since revisiting an edge does not affect the total score, we can freely traverse the edges of the component, meaning that we can move back and forth to reach all of them. Therefore, the best way to achieve the lowest cost is to visit every edge in the component.\nTo efficiently find and process the connected components of the graph, we use the Disjoint Set (Union-Find) data structure. When we Union two nodes, we merge their entire groups, as now a path exists between every node in one group and every node in the other. To maintain efficiency, the root of the larger group is chosen as the representative of the merge group. This minimizes the time needed for future Find operations by reducing the number of steps required to reach the current representative."

Film club was by far the most popular activity throughout, though table tennis demonstrated the strongest growth.\nIn 2000, 64 individuals participated in the film club, a figure that dipped to 60 in 2010 and then more than recovered to finish the period at 65. The trend for martial arts was similarly stable with a beginning data point of 38, a high of 39 in 2010, and a final figure of 37.\nThe remaining activities started the period lower with 27 participants for amateur drama, 18 for table tennis, and 0 for musical performances (unavailable at the time). Over the next 10 years, amateur dramatics commenced a decline that would end at just 5 by 2020, while table tennis underwent the inverse transformation, peaking at 52 by the same year.

    "text": "2.1 Rewrite Introduction\n\n2.1.1 Rewrite\nThe table shows how many hours people of different age use internet for fun and for work each week. My answer: The table illustrates the number of hours people of various ages use the internet for leisure and for professional each week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIssue\nExplanation\nCorrection\n\n\n\n\n“for professional”\n“Professional” is an adjective. You need a noun here.\nUse “for work” or “for professional purposes”\n\n\n“people of various ages”\nGood, but can be made more natural.\nTry “people in different age groups”\n\n\n“use the internet”\nFine, but could be made more academic.\nTry “spend online” or “use the internet for…”\n\n\nWord order\nEnding on “each week” is okay, but it reads better earlier.\nRearrange for fluency.\n\n\n\nBetter: The table illustrates the number of hours per week that people in different age groups spend online for leisure and work-related activities. Or: The table provides data on the weekly hours spent online by people of various age group, categorized by leisure and professional purposes.\nRewrite: The bar chart shows the percentage of households in four different income levels that had internet access in 2010 and 2020. I write: The bar chart illustrates the distribution of households in four various income levels that had internet access in 2010 and 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIssue\nCorrection\n\n\n\n\n“four various”\n❌ Redundant. Use either “four” or “various” — not both. → ✅ “four different” or just “four”\n\n\n“distribution of households”\n✅ Okay, but could be clearer — this chart shows percentages, not the count or physical distribution. Try “percentage of households”\n\n\nGrammar and flow\nSentence is understandable but can be more formal and concise\n\n\n\nBetter: The bar chart illustrates the percentage of households across four income levels that had access to the internet in 2010 and 2020. Or: The bar chart compares the proportion of households with internet access in four income groups for the years 2010 and 2020.\n\n\n2.1.2 Rewrite\nThe line graph shows the number of international students enrolled in Canadian universities between 2005 and 2020, broken down by region of origin.\nThe line graph illustrates how many international students enrolled in Canadian universities between 2005 and 2020, categorize by area of origin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIssue\nExplanation\nCorrection\n\n\n\n\n“how many international students”\nOkay, but more formal: “the number of international students”\n\n\n\n“categorize”\n❌ Wrong form → should be “categorized” (past participle in passive structure)\n\n\n\n“area of origin”\nAcceptable, but “region of origin” or “by region” is more common in academic writing\n\n\n\nFlow\nCombine ideas more smoothly with a formal tone\n\n\n\n\nBetter: The line graph illustrates the number of international students enrolled in Canadian universities from 2005 to 2020, categorized by region of origin. Or: The line graph presents data on international student enrollment in Canadian universities over a 15-year period, broken down by region of origin.\n\n\n2.1.3 Rewrite\nThe pie charts show the proportion of energy produced from five different sources in a European country in 1980 and 2020. I write: The pie charts illustrate the percentage of energy made from five different sources in a European country in 1980 and 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIssue\nExplanation\nFix\n\n\n\n\n“energy made from”\n❌ Informal/awkward for Task 1. Use “produced from” or “generated by”\n\n\n\n“in a European country”\n✅ This is fine and accurate\n\n\n\n“five different sources”\n✅ Good — “five sources” is enough, but “different” is okay for emphasis\n\n\n\n\nBetter: The pie charts illustrate the proportion of energy generated from five sources in a European country in the years 1980 and 2020. Or: The two pie charts compare the share of energy production by five distinct sources in a European country in 1980 and 2020.\n\n\n2.1.4 Rewrite\nThe table displays the average monthly income (in USD) for workers in three different sectors in five countries. I write: The table illustrates the salary of workers in three different sectors in five countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIssue\nComment\nSuggested Fix\n\n\n\n\n“illustrates”\n✅ Good verb for visuals\n\n\n\n“the salary”\n❌ Slightly vague → “salary” is better expressed as “average monthly income” to match the task\n\n\n\n“three different sectors”\n✅ Fine, though “various sectors” or “economic sectors” may be more formal\n\n\n\n“in five countries”\n✅ Good — you could also say “across five countries” for variety\n\n\n\n\nBetter: The table illustrates the average monthly income of workers across three sectors in five different countries. Or: The table presents data on the average monthly earnings of employees in three occupational sectors across five countries.\n\n\n2.1.5 Rewrite\nThe line graph shows the percentage of the population aged 65 and over in Japan, Sweden, and the USA from 1940 to 2040. I write: The line graph illustrates the proportion of the people who over 65 and over in Japan, Sweden, and the US between 1940 and 2040.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIssue\nExplanation\nFix\n\n\n\n\n“the people who over 65 and over”\n❌ Grammar mistake. You need: “people aged 65 and over”\n\n\n\n“the proportion of the people”\n❌ Too wordy. Use “the proportion of people” (no “the” before “people”)\n\n\n\n“US” vs “USA”\n✅ Both are fine. Choose one and stay consistent\n\n\n\n“between 1940 and 2040”\n✅ Correct and clear\n\n\n\n\nBetter: The line graph illustrates the proportion of people aged 65 and over in Japan, Sweden, and the USA between 1940 and 2040. Or: The line graph compares the percentage of the population aged 65 and above in Japan, Sweden, and the United States from 1940 to 2040.\nI write overview:\nWhile the number of USA senior citizen is slightly increase in throughout the period, that figure of Sweden and Japan are reduce on that time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIssue\nExplanation\nCorrection\n\n\n\n\n“number of USA senior citizen”\n❌ Wrong form: should be “percentage of senior citizens in the USA”\n\n\n\n“is slightly increase”\n❌ Incorrect verb form: should be “increases slightly”\n\n\n\n“are reduce”\n❌ Incorrect verb form again: should be “decline”, but actually this is factually wrong\n\n\n\nTrend accuracy\n❌ In fact, Japan and Sweden both increase overall, not decrease\n\n\n\n\nBetter: Overall, the proportion of elderly people increased in all three countries throughout the period, with Japan showing the most dramatic growth after 2020. Or: In general, all three countries experienced a rise in the percentage of people aged 65 and above, with Japan’s elderly population rising sharply after 2020. ## Overview\nAn overview I write: Overall, it is clear that people spend the time on the internet for professional purposes most in their 20s, while their time for online leisure is largest when teens.\nBetter:\nOverall, it is clear that internet use for work peaks among people in their 20s, while leisure-related usage is highest among teenagers.\n\nAvoid exact figures\nFocus on trends, not facts\nUse comparative language: most common, highest, dominant, peak, etc."

In the first question, we are given a situation and asked to explain why. The second question requires a clear opinion so we must choose a side. This is very important for our task response score. If we don’t choose a side and support that ‘position’ clearly, we will lose marks for our task response. We will get a maximum of 5 for task achievement if we do not choose a side.\nIt’s not important which side we choose as long as we choose one. Here are the options for the second questions:\n\nAgree: We think it’s a positive development that governments are spending more money on public transport. We support this opinion.\nDisagree: We think it’s a negative development that governments are spending more money on public transport. We support this opinion.\n\n\n\nClear essay structure\nDavid Lang recommend that we should give our opinion in the introduction as well as the conclusion (for all IELTS Task 2 questions). It’s OK to write a very general introduction and leave our opinion to the end. But it’s not as clear and we might run out of time before we’ve hot to our conclusion, so overall it’s a risky strategy.

    "title": "IELTS Essay Having Children at an Older Age",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Question:\nSome people choose to have their first child at an older age. What are the reasons? Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?\nDavid Lang’s sample In recent years, an increasing number of individuals have opted to start their families later in life. This trend raises the question of why more people are choosing to have their first child at an older age and whether the benefits of doing so justify the drawbacks.\nOne of the primary reasons for delaying parenthood is the pursuit of career stability in a worrying economic climate. In today’s competitive job market, many individuals, particularly women, prefer to establish themselves professionally before starting a family. By focusing on their careers in their twenties and early thirties, they can achieve financial security and attain higher positions, which often translates to job satisfaction and greater resources for their future children. This growing trend is reflected in how mainstream society now places significant emphasis on personal development and achieving personal goals before embarking on parenthood. For that reason, many young adults prioritize their own personal and financial welfare, a situation that engenders an atmosphere less conductive to having children early in life.\nThere are legitimate disadvantages connected with having children later in life. One of the primary concerns is the potential health risks for both the mother and the child. Advanced maternal age is often associated with a higher risk of complications such as gestational diabetes, hypertension, and chromosomal abnormalities. However, despite these drawbacks, the advantages of having children later in life due to greater maturity overshadow the hypothetical drawbacks. The emotional maturity and life experience that older parents bring to child-rearing can result in a more stable and nurturing environment. Older parents are likely to be more financially secure and better prepared to provide for their children’s education and well-being. The ability to make well-considered decisions and the patience developed over time can contribute to a more thoughtful and deliberate approach to parenting.\nIn conclusion, while there are valid concerns regarding the health risks associated with having children later in life, the benefits, such as financial stability, emotional maturity, and better preparation for parenthood, outweigh these disadvantages. As societal norms and medical advancements continue to evolve, the rend of delaying parenthood is likely to remain prevalent, reflecting the changing priorities and values of modern individuals.\nSample, disadvantages over advantages.\nAn increasing number of individuals are choosing to have their first child at an older age. This trend is driven by factors such as career prioritization, financial security, and a desire for greater personal maturity. While some argue that the benefits of delayed parenthood - like improved financial stability and enhanced life experience - outweigh the disadvantages, I strongly disagree. The potential health risks, fertility issues, and other practical challenges mean that the disadvantages ultimately outweigh any advantages.\nModern society has shifted priorities, and many couples now postpone parenthood for several reasons. Primarily, individuals strive to establish their careers and achieve financial stability before starting a family. This approach allows prospective parents to create a secure environment for their child, free from economic uncertainty. Furthermore, many believe that greater life experience and emotional maturity can lead to more thoughtful parenting decisions. As a result, the decision to delay having a first child is often seen as a strategic move to optimize one’s personal and professional circumstances.\nDespite these reasons, the drawbacks of having a first child at an older age are significant. Health concerns are paramount; older mothers face increased risks of pregnancy complications, such as gestational diabetes and hypertension, which can jeopardize both maternal and infant health. Additionally, advancing age is closely linked to decreased fertility, often necessitating expensive and emotionally draining fertility treatments. Beyond health, older parents might experience reduced physical stamina, which is crucial for the demanding nature of childcare, and a larger generational gap that can affect the parent-child relationship. These challenges make the prospect of delayed parenthood less attractive, as the risks and long-term implications overshadow the benefits of waiting.\nIn conclusion, although delaying parenthood may provide some advantages in terms of financial and emotional preparedness, the significant health risks, fertility challenges, and practical issues associated with having a first child later in life outweigh these benefit. Therefore, i contend that the disadvantages of postponing parenthood ultimately make it a less favorable option compared to earlier family planning.\nSample, advantages over disadvantages.\nIn recent years, an increasing number of individuals have chosen to have their first child at an older age. This trend is largely influenced by factors such as the pursuit of career goals, the desire for financial stability, and the accumulation of life experience before entering parenthood. I firmly believe that these advantages not only lead to more secure and thoughtful family planning but also contribute to improved parenting outcomes, ultimately outweighing the potential disadvantages.\nModern societal shifts have prompted many prospective parents to postpone starting a family. Primarily, individuals are keen to establish a stable career and secure a robust financial foundation before welcoming a child. This approach allows them to create a nurturing environment where the child’s needs are met without the stress of economic uncertainty. Furthermore, waiting until later in life often results in enhanced emotional maturity and life experience, enabling parents to make more considered decisions and effectively manage the challenges of raising a child. These reasons underscore why many see value in delaying parenthood as a strategic, long-term investment in both personal and familial well-being.\nThe advantages of choosing to have a child at an older age are manifold. With a well-established career and financial security, older parents are better equipped to provide for their child’s educational and extracurricular needs, contributing to the child’s overall development. In addition, greater maturity and life experience often translate into more patient, empathetic, and balanced parenting. Such parents typically possess enhanced problem-solving skills and resilience, which can be invaluable when navigating the inevitable challenges of childcare. Moreover, studies have shown that older parents tend to invest more time and resources in their children’s upbringing, resulting in a more stable and nurturing home environment. Collectively, these advantages not only promote healthier family dynamics but also pave the way for the child’s long-term success and well-being.\nIn conclusion, while there are inherent challenges associated with delayed parenthood, the benefits- ranging from financial stability and career establishment to increased emotional maturity and effective parenting- clearly outweigh the drawbacks. By choosing to have a child at an older age, many individuals are better prepared to offer a secure, supportive, and enriching environment for their children, ultimately leading to more positive outcomes for families."

It’s located in the northern part of the city and is widely regarded as one of the most ethical and well-designed zoos in the world.\nWhat impressed me most was the open-concept layout. Instead of case, many animals live in naturalistic habitats separated from visitors by moats or hidden barriers. I was able to observe orangutans swinging freely in trees above the walkways and giraffes roaming spacious enclosures.\nThere were also interactive sessions, such as feeding times and educational talks by zookeepers, where I learned a lot about endangered species and conservation efforts. The zoo also partners with various wildlife protection organizations and supports breeding programs for rare species.\nI felt genuinely inspired by the experience. It made me realize that when zoos are operated responsibly, they can help preserve biodiversity and raise public awareness about the threats facing wildlife today. I felt the zoo feeling hopeful and more committed to supporting conservation causes."

With habitat destruction accelerating and many species on the brink of extinction, zoos can serve as safe havens for breeding and research. That said, zoos that exist solely for entertainment, with poor living conditions, should be phased out.\n\n\nQ2: How can zoos educate the public?\nZoos have a unique ability to engage people emotionally by allowing close encounters with animals they would never see in the wild. Interactive exhibits, live demonstrations, and conservation talks can make complex environmental issues accessible and compelling, especially for children.\n\n\nQ3: What alternatives to zoos do you think could replace their role in education and conservation?\nWildlife sanctuaries and virtual reality experiences might be viable alternatives. Sanctuaries allow animals to live in more natural settings, while technology can simulate immersive encounters without keeping animals in captivity. However, these solutions aren’t always scalable or practical for endangered species preservation, so ethical zoos still have a role to play. # Gre essay\n\nThe director of a local zoo has claimed that the zoo must expand its exotic animal exhibit to attract more visitors. He cites a recent survey showing that 85% of new zoo visitors came specifically to see exotic animals. Based on this, he concludes that investing in new exotic species will increase overall ticket sales and boost the zoo’s revenue."

    "text": "Sample GRE Argument essay\nThe argument that expanding the exotic animal exhibit will increase zoo revenue is unconvincing, as it rests on several questionable assumptions and lacks sufficient supporting evidence. Without addressing these issues, the zoo may risk investing in an initiative that fails to produce the expected benefits.\nFirst, the argument assumes a direct causal relationship between exotic animals and increased attendance. While the director cites a survey indicating that 85% of new visitors came specifically to see exotic species, this data may be misleading. The survey does not clarify whether these visitors would have attended the zoo regardless of the exhibit, nor does it prove that exotic animals were the primary motivator. Other factors such as promotions, seasonal events, or group tours may have influenced their visit. Without clear evidence of causation, the conclusion remains speculative.\nSecondly, the reliability of the survey itself is questionable. The argument does not provide information about the sample size, methodology, or representativeness of the surveyed visitors. For instance, if the survey was conducted only during a temporary exotic animal showcase, the data may not reflect general visitor preferences. Additionally, focusing solely on new visitors ignores the preferences of returning guests, who may value other aspects of the zoo such as local wildlife, interactive experiences, or conservation programs.\nFurthermore, the argument overlooks potential downsides and costs associated with expanding the exhibit. Exotic animals often require specialized care, habitats, and veterinary expertise, which can significantly increase operating expenses. If the new exhibit fails to attract sufficient new visitors or if existing patrons are alienated by the change, the zoo might face financial losses rather than gains. A cost-benefit analysis would be necessary to determine whether the investment is justified.\nIn conclusion, the argument makes a hasty recommendation based on incomplete and possibly flawed evidence. To strengthen the case, the director should conduct more comprehensive research, including long-term visitor trends, preferences of different demographics, and a detailed financial projection. Only then can the zoo make an informed decision about expanding its exotic animal exhibit."

    "text": "David Lang\nThe diagram details how recycled paper is made. Looking from an overall perspective, it is readily apparent that the process involves three main stages beginning with initial collection and transportation, followed by cleaning and processing, and lastly the rolling of the final product. The process is entirely man-made.\nIn order to produce recycled paper, used paper is first sourced and transported by conveyor belt to a processing plant. The used paper is then made into unfiltered pulp by using water and various chemicals. The pulp must then be filtered with water being removed.\nAfter filtering is complete, the filtered paper pulp is sent by a tube to a container with water and soap to be further cleaned. Air is pumped into the container and ink is removed. There is then an additional cleaning with water and chemicals before the final rolling states commence. To create useable recycled paper rolls, the cleaned and filtered pulp is placed on a conveyor belt where heated rollers flatten the paper and remove excess water.\nChat GPT\n\nOverall process: cyclical but shown in a linear step-by-step format.\nNumber of stages: 4 main stages - making pulp, filtering, cleaning, and making paper.\nRaw material: Used paper.\nEnd product: Recycled paper rolls.\nMaterials/chemicals used: Water\nKey step:\n\n\nUsed paper transported on a conveyor belt.\nMixed with water and chemicals - pulp.\nFiltered to remove larger impurities.\nCleaned using soap, air, water -&gt; removes ink.\nFinal cleaned pulp used to make paper -&gt; heated rollers + drying.\n\nUseful vocab: - Recycled materials - Industrial process - Mechanical separation - De-inking - Environmental sustainability\nThe diagram illustrates the step-by-step process involved in the production of recycled paper from used paper materials. The procedure consists of four main stages, starting with the creation of pulp and culminating in the manufacture of new paper rolls.\nIn the first stage, used paper is placed on a conveyor belt and carried to a machine where it is mixed with water and chemicals. This mixture breaks the paper down into unfiltered pulp. The pulp then moves to the next stage where is it filtered. This step removes large unwanted materials, leaving behind filtered pulp.\nIn the third stage, the filtered pulp is cleaned using water, soap, and air. This helps separate and remove ink from the pulp. Water and additional chemicals are also added to enhance the cleaning process. As a result, the pulp becomes cleaner and suitable for making new paper.\nFinally, the cleaned pulp is transferred onto a conveyor belt and passed through heated rollers. These rollers press and dry the material, forming sheets of recycled paper, which are then rolled up for reuse.\n\nEnvironment\n\nHow are environmental problems dealt with in your country? In my country, environmental issues are taken seriously, but there’s still a long way to go. The government has made some rules about pollution and waste, and there are programs to plant more trees. But I think sometimes the laws are not enforced strictly, and people still throw garbage in the wrong places. In my country, environmental problems are addressed through a combination of legislation and public awareness campaigns. For instance, the government has introduced stricter regulations on industrial emissions and waste disposal. However, enforcement remains inconsistent, and public participation is not as widespread as it could be, which limits the overall effectiveness of these measures.\nWhat can be done to make people recycle more often? I think if people know more about the benefits of recycling, they might do it more. Also, the government can give rewards or discounts to people who recycle. Putting more recycling bins around cities would help too. To encourage more frequent recycling, a combination of education and incentives could be effective. Public awareness campaigns can highlight the environmental and economic benefits of recycling, while practical steps- like providing more accessible recycling bins and offering financial incentives - can make the habit easier to adopt. Legislation that mandates in households and businesses could also play a significant role.\nWhat is the most pressing environmental problem? In my opinion, the biggest problem is air pollution, especially in big cities. The air quality is really bad because of cars and factories. It affects people’s health, and it’s hard to fix quickly. Arguably, climate change is the most urgent environmental issue we face today. It not only exacerbates other problems like extreme weather and rising sea levels but also poses serious threats to biodiversity and food security. While localized issues like air pollution are severe, climate change has a truly global impact that requires immediate and coordinated action.\nIs recycling a common practice in your country? Recycling is becoming more common, but it’s not something everyone does. Some people separate their trash at home, but many still throw everything together. It depends a lot on where you live - cities usually have more systems in place. Recycling is practiced in many parts of the country, particularly in urban areas where infrastructure is more developed. However, it’s far from universal. While some individuals and communities are highly conscientious, others lack access to proper facilities or are simply unaware of how to recycle effectively. So, it’s growing, but still inconsistent.\nAre governments or individuals more responsible? I think both are responsible. The government needs to make good rules and make people follow the, but individuals also need to care about the environment and take action. It’s a shared responsibility. While both governents and individuals play vital roles, I believe governents bear greater responsibility due to their ability to enact policies, regulate industries, and invest in sustainable infrastructure. That said, individual behavior is equally crucial, as collective action often stes fro personal choices. Ideally, both should work hand in hand to address environental issues effectively."

    "section": "1.1 Review",
    "text": "1.1 Review\nWe began our study of complex sentences by learning that a complex sentence is an independent clause (a sentence) plus a subordinate clause. We learned that there are three types of subordinate clauses: adverb, adjective (the relative clause), and noun.\nWe have covered subordinate clauses of the adverb and adjective variety. The adverbial clauses appear to the left or the right of independent clauses and begin with subordinating conjunctions:\n\nafter, as if, as long as, as soon as, although, as, as if, because, before, even if, if, since, so that, though, till, unless, until, when, whenever, wherever, while.\n\nThe adjectival clauses are relative clauses. We focused on three key relative pronouns: who, that, and which.\nThis bring us to our final clause type-the noun clause.\nLike their cousins are adverbial and relative clauses, the noun clauses, too, begin with key words. We can call these key word noun-clause markers.\nHere is a list:\n\nthat, if, whether\n{words that can be used to create question} how, what, when, where, whom, why\n{the -ever words} however, whatever, whenever, wherever, whichever, whoever, whomever.\n\nIf we take an independent clause (a sentence) and add a noun-clause marker to the front of it, we get a noun clause.\n\nnoun-clause marker + independent clause = noun clause\n\nExamples:\ntake a sentences: the foal was delivered by helicopter\nadd a noun-clause marker: that\nget a noun clause: that the foal was delivered by helicopter\nOnce more:\n\ntake a sentence: the Shah wanted it delivered\nadd a noun-clause marker: whenever\nget a noun clause: whenever the Shah wanted it delivered.\n\nWhen a noun clause get added to an independent clause, the result is a complex sentence. Study two examples:\n\nexample 1: What the clown found so funny was a mystery. (complex sentence? no)\nexample 2: We did not understand why George was twitching in the forsythias (complex sentence? yes)\n\nA complex sentence consists of an independent clause and at least one subordinate clause. Example 1 above consists of a noun clause plus a predicate (was a mystery) and, therefore, is not a complex sentence. In example 2, however, we do find one independent and one subordinate clause.\n\nindependent clause: we did not understand\nsubordinate clause: why George was twitching in the forsythias"

It helps me reflect on my goals and sometimes come up with creative solutions or even new plans for the future.\n\n\n4.1.2 Do you ever write a diary or journals?\n(Using muse as a noun) Yes, I write in a journal regularly. It’s mostly filled with personal thoughts and random musings about life, people I meet, or even things I read. I find it helps me process my emotions and clears my mind.\n\n\n4.1.3 Some people believe that creativity is as important as academic skills.\nMany creative breakthroughs begin with quiet musings, as people reflect deeply before arriving at unique ideas.\n\n\n4.1.4 Modern life is often too fast-paced for personal reflection\nIn today’s busy world, people rarely have the time to muse on their own experiences, which may reduce self-awareness and emotional clarity.\n\n\n4.1.5 Do people today spend enough time thinking deeply?\nHonestly, I don’t think so. Life today is fast-paced, and people are often distracted by social media or constant notifications. Deep thinking requires space and silence, and most people rarely take time to just sit and muse about important questions or life decisions. I think that kind of reflection is crucial for personal growth.\n\n\n4.1.6 Why do some people enjoy writing journals or personal blogs?\nI think it’s partly because writing helps people process their thoughts. For many, a journal is a private place to record their musings about daily life or future goals. It’s also a way to make sense of emotions. Even blogs, which are more public, often start from personal reflection.\n\n\n4.1.7 Is creativity important in education?\nDefinitely. While academic skills are essential, creativity allows students to explore ideas in original ways. Some of the best innovations come from people who took time to muse on a problem from a different perspective. Encouraging students to think creatively also makes learning more meaningful.\n\n\n4.1.8 Do you think quiet time is necessary for creativity?\nYes, I believe it’s vital. Creative thinking often comes from calm, undistracted moments - those quiet times when you’re not actively working, but your mind is still turning over ideas. Many artists or writers have said their best thoughts came during moments of musing, like walking alone or staring out the window."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Question:\nIn numerous nations, there is a growing trend for individuals to frequently discuss financial matters, such as their earnings or expenditure, in everyday conversation. What are the reasons behind this phenomenon? Is it advantageous or detrimental?\n\nThere is an increasing tendency for individuals in the modern world to openly discuss their finances in daily conversation. In my opinion, this is a result of a general lack of self-awareness and is decidedly negative given the opportunity cost it engenders.\nThe primary reason many people are prone to talk their financial dealings originates in society generally. In the past, a sense of modesty or concern for decorum might have compelled reticence. Today, some of the most widely discussed topics in the media, online, in film, and in literature concern cryptocurrencies, the real estate market, stock equities, the price of gold, and other investments. A person discussing these matters is likely only interested in subtle boasting if venting frustrations without awareness of the emotions or engagement of their interlocutor. The result over time has been that many people have developed a shameless habit.\nIn my view, discussion finances often precludes a number of more worthwhile topics of conversation. Since the majority of useful financial research can be conducted online or done in professional settings, there are more pressing areas that should be discussed in daily life. For example, two friends having a conversation at a cafe would derive greater value from telling stories, joking with one another, or delving into a more serious topic related to politics, the arts, or psychology. Such discussions are likely to develop their understanding of the world and their emotional intelligence. Discussion of money, on the other hand, wastes valuable time and energy for little concrete outcome.\nIn conclusion, the inclination to speak of one’s personal finances stems from a fundamentally modern self-indulgence and often prevents the discussion of more enjoyable or meaningful topics. Naturally, these generalizations do not apply to all individuals.\n\nChatGPT’s essay:\nIn numerous nations, a growing trend has emerged where people openly discuss financial matters, including their earnings and expenditures, in everyday conversations. This phenomenon can be attributed to a range of social and economic factors, and i firmly believe that it is advantageous. Open dialogue about personal finances not only foster financial literacy but also encourages better money management and transparency within communities.\nOne primary reason for this trend is the rapid spread of financial education and the influence of digital media. With the advent of social media platforms and financial blogs, individuals have unprecedented access to information about budgeting, investing, and saving. This exposure has led many to feel more confident in discussing their financial situations, as they seek advice and validation from peers. Additionally, economic uncertainty in many regions has prompted individuals to share personal financial experiences as a way of coping and learning from one another. For instance, during periods of economic downturn, people often exchange tips on reducing expenses or finding alternative income sources. This collective sharing not only helps individuals navigate challenging time but also creates a support network where practical financial strategies are exchanged openly.\nThe open discussion of financial matters carries significant benefits for both individuals and society at large. Firstly, it promotes financial literacy by normalizing conversations about money, which can demystify complex financial topic and empower people to make informed decisions. As people become more knowledgeable about financial planning and investment strategies, they are better equipped to secure their futures and contribute to economic growth. Secondly, this trend encourages transparency and accountability, reducing the stigma around discussing personal finances. For example, when individuals talk about budgeting and debt management, it can inspire others to examine their own spending habits, ultimately leading to a more financially responsible community. By fostering an environment where financial struggles and successes are shared openly, society as a whole benefits from improved financial stability and reduced inequality.\nIn conclusion, the increasing tendency for individuals to discuss financial matters in everyday conversation is driven by greater access to information and a need for mutual support during uncertain economic times. I contend that this development is advantageous, as it enhances financial literacy, transparency, and responsible money management. Ultimately, such open dialogue can empower communities to achieve greater financial stability and economic well-being.\n\nGrammar structures\n\nComplex Sentence Structures\n\nUse of subordinate clauses to add detail. Example: “With the advent of social media platforms and financial blog, individuals have unprecedented access to information about budgeting, investing, and saving.”\n\nCause and Effect Constructions\n\nPhrases such as “can be attributed to” and “leads to” explain reasons and consequences. Example: “This phenomenon can be attributed to a range of social and economic factors.”\n\nConditional and Hypothetical Phrasing:\n\nImplicit conditionals that suggest potential outcomes or benefits. Example: “when individuals talk about budgeting and debt management, it can inspire others to examine their own spending habits.”\n\nComparative Structure:\n\nUsing comparisons to show differences in outcomes. Example: “For instance, during periods of economic downturn, people often exchange tips on reducing expenses or finding alternative income sources.”\n\nUse of Passive Voice:\n\nPassive constructions to emphasize processes or outcomes rather than actors.\nExample: “This phenomenon can be attributed to a range of social and economic factors.”\n\nLinking Devices and Transitional Phrases:\n\nWords and phrases such as “Firstly,” “Secondly,” “In conclusion,” and “For example” to organize ideas and guide the reader.\n\n\n\n\nLexical Items\n\nAdvanced Vocabulary:\n\nWords such as “unprecedented,” “demystify,” “transparency,” “accountability,” and “empower” elevate the formality and clarity of the argument.\n\nFinancial Terminology:\n\nSpecific terms related to finance like “budgeting,” “investing,” “saving,” “financial literacy,” “debt management,” and “spending habits.”\n\nDescriptive Adjectives:\n\nTerms that add detail and nuance, for example “open dialogue,” “collective sharing,” “rigorous, random testing,” and “financially responsible.”\n\nCollocations and Fixed Phrases:\n\nCommon phrases that support the essay’s theme such as “financial matters,” “economic uncertainty,” “personal financial experiences,” and “mutual support.”\n\nTransitional Vocabulary:\n\nWords that link ideas logically like “furthermore,” “additionally,” and “ultimately” ensure smooth progression throughout the essay.\n\nOpinion and Evaluation Language:\n\nPhrases that express clear stance such as “I firmly believe,” “it is essential,” “I contend that,” and “I contend that this development is advantageous.”"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Question:\nFewer and fewer people today write by hand using a pen or pencil.\nWhat are the reasons for this?\nIs this a positive or a negative development?\nDavid Lang’s essay:\nToday, the act of writing by hand using a pen or pencil has become increasingly uncommon. This essay will delve into the reasons behind this trend and evaluate whether it is a positive or negative development for individuals and society as a whole.\nOne primary reason for the dwindling use of handwriting is the pervasive presence of technology. Inn an age dominated by computers, smartphones, and tables, individuals find it more convenient to type their thoughts and ideas rather than engaging in the laborious process of writing by hand. The speed and efficiency offered by digital devices have made it easier to edit, store, and share written content, rendering handwriting seemingly obsolete. To illustrate this, consider the rapid rise of communication platforms such as email, instant messaging apps, and social media. These platforms provide users with the ability to effortlessly send and receive messages, eliminating the need for handwritten letters or notes. This convenience extends to practical considerations for professionals in various fields, such as journalists, researchers, and writers, who often rely on digital platforms and word processors for their work. The ease of editing, revising, and sharing digital content outweighs the traditional pen-and-paper approach.\nWhile the decline of handwriting may offer certain advantages, it also brings forth potential negative consequences. Handwriting is an essential skill that fosters cognitive development, improves memory retention, and allows for creative expression. The act of physically forming letters and words engages different areas of the brain, promoting better comprehension and critical thinking skills. Losing this skill may hinder individuals ability to think and express themselves effectively. Most importantly, the personal touch and emotional connection associated with handwritten letters or cards cannot be replicated by digital alternatives. Handwritten messages convey sincerity, thoughtfulness, and a see of intimacy. Losing the art of handwriting may irrevocably erode these meaningful human connections.\nIn conclusion, the decline of handwriting can be attributed to the prevalence of technology and practical considerations. While there are advantages to digital communication and typing, the negative implications for cognitive development and personal connections are more significant and must be mitigated by the relevant authorities.\nArguing that it is a positive development\nIn today’s digital age, fewer and fewer people write by hand and using a pen or pencil. This shift can be attributed to pared technological advancements and changing educational practices, and I firmly believe that it is a positive development. The move away from handwriting not only enhances efficiency and accessibility but also reflects progress towards modern communication methods.\nThe decline in handwriting is primarily driven by the ubiquity of digital devices and evolving communication needs. With the widespread availability of computers, smartphones, and tablets, individuals find it more convenient to type and send messages instantly. Educational institutions are increasingly incorporating technology into their curricula, emphasizing digital literacy over traditional penmanship. Moreover, the rise of social media and email as primary communication tools has diminished the need for handwritten correspondence. These factors have collectively contributed to a cultural shift where efficiency and speed in communication are prioritized over the art of handwriting.\nTransitioning from handwriting to digital writing brings several significant benefits. Firstly, digital communication enhances productivity by enabling rapid information exchange and easy editing, which is especially beneficial in professional and academic settings. Additionally, typing reduces issues related to illegible handwriting, thereby minimizing misunderstandings. Digital platforms also offer vast storage and the ability to search through documents instantly, streamlining information management. Furthermore, this shift is environmentally friendly, as it reduces the consumption of paper and other stationery supplies. Overall, the adoption of digital writing foster greater accessibility and adaptability in our fast-pace, globalized world, contributing to more efficient and sustainable practices.\nIn conclusion, the decreasing reliance on handwriting in favor of digital communication is driven by technological advancements and evolving social practices. I contend that this development is positive, as it significantly boosts efficiency, clarity, and environmental sustainability while aligning with the demands of modern life. Embracing digital writing is not only a natural progression but also a vital step towards more effective and accessible communication in the 21st century."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In recent years, there has been a rise in the use of performance-enhancing substances in sports. What are the consequences of doping for athletes? What measures should be taken to combat this issue?\nThere has been a considerable rise in detections for performance-enhancing substances in athletic competitions recently. In my opinion, the most likely consequences for athletes concern their careers and this infraction is best tackled through more sophisticated screening tests.\nIn the majority of cases, athletes risk lasting career repercussions when caught doping. The first and most obvious consequences are financial. An athlete who tests positive for a banned substance will certainly be banned for a defined amount of time, potentially permanently in serious cases, and will forfeit salary and prize money over this period. Beyond raw salary, most athletes receive endorsements and a worsening public image will undoubtedly damage those business relationships as well. Relatedly, an athlete’s legacy is also at stake. A well-known example of this would be the baseball player Barry Bonds who not only lost the final years of an illustrious career to suspensions but has also not been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame due to his past transgressions and numerous failed tests.\nIn order to combat the pervasiveness of performance-enhancing drugs, sporting authorities must invest in modernized testing procedures. The most complex testing is currently utilized in the Olympics, however there are flaws in this system as it is often compromised by corruption and the equally sophisticated doping methods of certain nations. A more pertinent case of study would be in sports such as boxing and MMA where testing can literally mean the difference between life and death. In boxing, athletes often agree to their own testing procedures contractually. This method is inferior to vesting power in an authority, such as the UFC, that can ensure tests are modern and fairly conducted. Most UFC athletes are tested at random points throughout the year as well as prior to and immediately after bouts. Applying such a policy across various sports would not only catch the bast majority of infractions but also, more importantly, deter abuse even beginning.\nIn conclusion, athletes risk reputational and financial damage by doping and this can be prevented as testing becomes more comprehensive and potent. These measures are necessary to safeguard the integrity of sporting competitions around the world.\n\nIn recent years, the use of performance-enhancing drugs in sports has increased, posing significant challenges to fair competition. Doping not only harm an athlete’s career and finances but also damages the trust between fans, sponsors, and sporting institutions. I firmly believe that to protect the integrity of sports, it is essential to implement more advanced and transparent testing procedures.\nAthletes who resort to doping face serious long-term consequences that extend beyond temporary suspensions. When an athletes tests positive for banned substances, they risk losing salaries, prize money, and lucrative endorsements. For example, a renowned baseball player might be suspended, causing them to forfeit not only their immediate earnings but also potential future opportunities, such as Hall of Fame induction. This example clearly shows that doping can irreversibly tarnish an athlete’s legacy and career, leading to both financial ruin and a permanent stain on their reputation.\nTo effectively counter the issue of doping, sports authorities must adopt modern, comprehensive testing protocols. While major competitions like the Olympics employ advanced testing, the current is sometimes undermined by corruption and the ever-evolving sophistication of doping techniques. In sports like boxing and mixed martial arts, for instance, some athletes are subjected to self-regulated tests and lack objectivity. In contrast, organizations such as the UFC implement rigorous, random testing both before and after events, ensuring a fairer system. Adopting these strict measures across all sports would not only detect infractions more reliably but also serve as a strong deterrent against doping. By ensuring that testing is both modern and impartial, the integrity of competitive sports can be maintained, safeguarding athletes’ careers and reputation of the sport.\nIn conclusion, doping leads to severe financial and reputational damage for athletes while undermining the fairness of sports competitions. Only through the implementation of advanced, transparent testing procedures can we hope to deter doping and preserve the true spirit of sportsmanship for future generations.\n\nVocabulary\nFor extra practice, write an antonym (opposite word) on a piece of paper to help you remember the new vocabulary: 1. There has been a considerable rise in detections - There has been a significant increase in identifications 2. performance-enhancing substances - performance-boosting substances 3. athletic competitions - sporting events 4. most likely consequences for - probable outcomes for"

The key distinction is actually convexity:\nConvex problems (nonnegative curvature) can be solved reliably in polynomial time using interior-point methods, gradient-based schemes with global convergence guarantees, and other efficient algorithms. The feasible set and objective have no ‘valleys’ that trap algorithms in suboptimal points.\nNonconvex problems (regions of negative curvature) are generally NP-hard. They can exhibit multiple local minima, saddle points, and complex landscape features, so finding the global minimum is computationally intractable in the worst case (unless P=NP).\nThus, the presence of negative curvature (nonconvexity) — not merely ‘nonlinearity’ — is what makes an optimization problem hard to solve.\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Define convex and nonconvex functions\nconvex = lambda x: x**2\nnonconvex = lambda x: x**2 + 5*np.sin(3*x)\n\n# Domain\nx = np.linspace(-3, 3, 500)\n\n# Plot both functions\nplt.figure()\nplt.plot(x, convex(x), label='Convex: $f(x)=x^2$')\nplt.plot(x, nonconvex(x), label='Nonconvex: $f(x)=x^2+5\\sin(3x)$')\n\n# Mark minima\n# For convex, minimum at x=0\nplt.scatter(0, convex(0), color='black', label='Convex minimum')\n# For nonconvex, approximate local minima\nd = nonconvex(x)\nidx = (np.diff(np.sign(np.diff(d))) &gt; 0).nonzero()[0] + 1\nplt.scatter(x[idx], d[idx], color='red', s=20, label='Nonconvex local minima')\n\nplt.title('Convex vs Nonconvex Landscapes')\nplt.xlabel('x')\nplt.ylabel('f(x)')\nplt.legend()\nplt.tight_layout()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnegative curvature (nonconvexity) — not merely ‘nonlinearity’ — is what makes an optimization problem hard to solve."

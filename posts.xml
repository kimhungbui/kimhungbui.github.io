  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>🎯 Theme: Loneliness and perseverance at the start of the journey. A quiet morning. The main character begins another study day while carrying the weight of emotional wounds.</p>
<p>🪟 Section 1: Opening Scene Mood: Stillness, quiet, slight anxiety Place: Tiny rented room in a big city (maybe HCMC), early morning</p>
<p>The alarm buzzes at 5:30 AM.</p>
<p>He sits up on a thin mattress. His desk is full of papers.</p>
<p>The sun hasn’t risen. The city is still asleep.</p>
<p>Coffee boils in a small metal pot. The sound is the only thing breaking the silence.</p>
<p>(Possible line) “Outside, the world slept. Inside, he fought another silent battle — one more morning, one more step.”</p>
<p>🕰️ Section 2: Flashback or Reflection He sees the photo of his girlfriend and him on the phone.</p>
<p>Thinks about the last time he truly laughed — maybe when she was beside him.</p>
<p>That moment of hope when he first opened a textbook on AI and believed in a better future.</p>
<p>“Love was warm. But it faded. Study was hard. But it stayed.”</p>
<p>✉️ Section 3: Small Action or Event He checks his phone: one academic rejection email.</p>
<p>Then, a message from an old friend: “You still trying that PhD thing?”</p>
<p>He sighs. But then, he opens the GRE prep book anyway.</p>
<p>Chooses a difficult passage to read aloud in English.</p>
<p>🧠 Section 4: Internal Growth or Setback He almost breaks down reading aloud, but he doesn’t.</p>
<p>Recalls his ex’s words: “You’re emotionally too soft for academia.”</p>
<p>He clenches his fist. He writes a quote on a post-it: “Strong is quiet. Brave is small. But still continues.”</p>
<p>Pins it to the wall.</p>
<p>🌫️ Section 5: Chapter Close He opens the window. Fog outside.</p>
<p>The sky turns a pale orange.</p>
<p>He whispers: “One day… one day I’ll make it.”</p>
<p>The city begins to wake up. But for him, it already began.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The alarm buzzed at 5:30 AM, its shrill tone slicing through the heavy stillness like a razor across silk.</p>
<p>His eyes opened immediately — not with urgency, but as if the body simply knew its cue. He lay motionless for a few seconds, staring at the ceiling with the faint outline of a water stain slowly coming into focus. In the dim light, it looked like a cracked map — a world he didn’t recognize, a world he didn’t belong to.</p>
<p>The mattress beneath him groaned as he sat up, its foam already flattened from months of use. It wasn’t a bed, really — just layers of fabric and compromise. Cold air brushed his ankles. He instinctively reached for the old hoodie crumpled at the foot of the bed, pulling it over his thin T-shirt.</p>
<p>The room around him remained hushed.<br>
Just 12 square meters. No decoration. No luxury. Just purpose.</p>
<p>The desk dominated one wall — a battlefield of papers, pens, books in English and Vietnamese, sticky notes curled at the corners. One notebook lay open with a sentence written five times over, the ink pressure weakening at the final repetition:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>“I will reach my future.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beside the notebook was a photo frame, turned face-down.</p>
<p>He stood slowly, stretching with the careful control of someone trying not to wake a sleeping world. A small, steel pot sat on the single-burner gas stove. The same one his father had used when working construction far from home. He filled it with water, hands moving on habit, and struck a match. The gas hissed, then bloomed into a trembling flame.</p>
<p>He listened to the soft crackling of the fire beneath the kettle, its rhythm grounding. That sound — that modest ritual — was the anchor of his mornings.</p>
<p>Outside the window, the city was still in slumber. Motorbikes hadn’t yet started their impatient chorus. Street vendors hadn’t called out their breakfast offers. Even the sky felt distant — still inked in predawn gray.</p>
<p>He poured in two spoonfuls of coarse Vietnamese coffee into the metal filter. It hissed faintly as the water passed through, dripping slow and dark into a chipped enamel mug. The bitter scent rose quickly, filling the room, warm and familiar like an old friend who never asked questions.</p>
<p>He took a seat at the desk, hands cupped around the mug for heat. Steam rose, soft and ghostly, curling upward and disappearing into the shadows near the ceiling.</p>
<p>He didn’t check his phone. He didn’t open his laptop.<br>
He just sat — drinking in silence, drinking in stillness.</p>
<p>A voice echoed in his mind — his own voice, recorded days ago and played back over and over:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>“Improve your emotions. Control your mind. That’s how you win in both love and research.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He sipped.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>“Outside, the world slept. Inside, he fought another silent battle — one more morning, one more step.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He pulled a notebook close and uncapped a pen.<br>
Today, he would revise two math lectures, solve three GRE quant problems, read one research paper on medical AI.<br>
Today, he would not talk about sadness. He would fold it into equations.</p>
<p>The clock ticked softly.<br>
It was 5:47 AM.</p>
<p>The city would wake soon.<br>
But for now —<br>
this hour was his alone.</p>
<hr>
<p>The glow of the phone screen pierced the dim light of the room.</p>
<p>He hadn’t meant to look at it. He just wanted to check the time. But there she was—framed in a memory.</p>
<p>A photo from last year: the two of them sitting on the rooftop of her dorm, a bowl of instant noodles between them, steam rising like a soft cloud in the night air. She was laughing, her eyes crinkled in that way that always made his chest feel like it had too much inside.</p>
<p>He hadn’t laughed like that in a long time. Not from the chest. Not the kind of laugh that felt like breathing again after holding it too long.</p>
<p>The silence of the present closed in tighter.</p>
<p>He set the phone down beside him, carefully, like it might break. Or maybe like <em>he</em> might.</p>
<p>Love had been real—so real it colored the days in bright, foolish light. In those early months, he thought they could beat everything: stress, family pressure, burnout, even the creeping doubt that sometimes bloomed behind his quiet smile.</p>
<p>But the days grew longer. Work harder. Rejections heavier.</p>
<p>Still, he remembered something.<br>
The day he opened his first AI textbook.</p>
<p>It wasn’t in class. It was late at night, on his laptop, sitting cross-legged on the cold tiled floor of a rented room just like this one. A YouTube lecture had introduced him to neural nets, and something clicked.</p>
<p>For a few hours, the world made sense. Not perfectly—but enough to believe that learning could <em>mean</em> something. That understanding could give shape to a chaotic life.</p>
<p>In that moment, ambition was born—not as arrogance, but as hope.</p>
<p>He want to be rich. Or famous.</p>
<p>He just wanted to be <em>capable</em>.<br>
Capable enough to earn respect.<br>
Capable enough to take care of her.<br>
Capable enough to build something that might one day help someone else like him.</p>
<p>That night, he whispered to himself like a vow:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I’ll keep going. Even if it’s just me.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He rose from the mattress, stretched, and stood barefoot on the cold tile. The kettle hissed. Coffee would be ready soon.</p>
<p>He walked to the desk—cluttered with scribbled notes, research printouts, half-read papers. In the corner of the table sat a worn-out notebook. Spiral-bound, the first few pages curled from use.</p>
<p>He opened it slowly.</p>
<p>The handwriting was messier back then. The first page:<br>
<strong>“Study Plan: Deep Learning – 6 Months.”</strong><br>
Written in neat boxes, optimistic bullets.<br>
A line underneath:<br>
<strong>“If I don’t give up, something will change.”</strong></p>
<p>He smiled. Not a happy smile—something softer, tinged with nostalgia and a little pity.</p>
<p>Back then, everything had seemed clearer. Simpler.<br>
Study, love, sleep. Repeat.<br>
Even when the world around him felt uncertain, he believed he could will his future into existence with enough effort.</p>
<p>And he wasn’t alone.</p>
<p>She used to sit beside him in coffee shops, studying her own books.<br>
She once said:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“You look cute when you’re focused… like you’re trying to save the world with math.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He didn’t answer then—too shy maybe. But he’d never forgotten that line.</p>
<p>Because for a moment, someone <em>saw</em> him—not for what he lacked, but for what he could become.</p>
<p>He turned another page.</p>
<p>A rough sketch of a neural net. Then a heart drawn next to it, her doodle. Tiny letters beside it:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Your brain is full of wires, but your heart is still soft.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That version of her—playful, loving, a little chaotic—felt distant now.</p>
<p>Work had changed her. And him.<br>
Deadlines stretched her thin. His own studies turned inward.<br>
Calls became shorter. Messages slower.<br>
Yet the ache remained constant, like phantom warmth on a cold bed.</p>
<p>He sat down and let the notebook rest on his lap. The past wasn’t painful because it was gone. It was painful because it was <em>beautiful</em>.</p>
<p>And because beauty, once tasted, is hard to live without.</p>
<p>He took a sip of coffee. Bitter. No sugar—just how he liked it now.<br>
Somewhere along the way, he had stopped sweetening things. Drinks. Words. Feelings.</p>
<p>He stared at the wall, blank except for a single printed quote he’d taped months ago:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Pursue what is meaningful, not what is expedient.” — Jordan B. Peterson.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He remembered printing it after a fight with her.<br>
A stupid fight. About time, about attention, about promises made and slowly broken by exhaustion.</p>
<p>Back then, he thought that pursuing meaning meant pushing harder—more study, more knowledge, more progress.<br>
But now… he wondered if meaning had slipped quietly out of the room when he chose books over soft conversations.</p>
<p>Love, he realized, didn’t vanish in a day.<br>
It faded. Like a photograph left in sunlight.<br>
Slowly. Softly. Until you’re not sure whether it’s still there or just the memory of it.</p>
<p>She never said, “I don’t love you anymore.”<br>
But her silences had grown longer. Her eyes dimmer when they met his.<br>
And he—so obsessed with building a future—forgot to share the present.</p>
<p>He tapped the screen of his phone. That photo of them—her hand curled into his hoodie sleeve, his head leaning on hers. It was still there.<br>
Still glowing.<br>
Still warm.</p>
<p>But like all light, it came from the past.</p>
<p>He took a deep breath, then reached for his pen.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the notebook page, beneath the heart and the wires, he wrote:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Maybe study stayed not because it was easier—<br>
but because it never stopped needing me.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then he closed the notebook, slowly. Deliberately.<br>
And turned back to the desk.</p>
<p>Outside, the city began to wake.<br>
Inside, he returned to his war — no longer for love or even ambition,<br>
but for something quieter: understanding. Clarity. Peace.</p>
<p>And perhaps, one day, a new kind of connection.</p>
<hr>
<p>The phone buzzed again.<br>
He turned it over slowly—almost lazily—as if stalling would soften whatever was waiting on the other side.</p>
<p>Subject: <strong>“Application Update — Regretfully…”</strong><br>
He didn’t open it.<br>
He didn’t need to.<br>
The first words told enough.</p>
<p>A sigh escaped him—not frustration, not sorrow—something in between. A tiredness that had long since fused with his bones.</p>
<p>His thumb slid across the screen, flicking the email away like swatting a fly.<br>
But just as he reached to set the phone down, another message popped up.<br>
A notification from someone he hadn’t heard from in over a year:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>“Yo bro. You still trying that PhD thing?”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>No punctuation. No judgment in the words.<br>
But somehow, he could feel it.<br>
Like a smirk hidden behind the screen.<br>
Or maybe, he just imagined it. Maybe his own doubt turned that sentence into a sting.</p>
<p>His eyes stayed fixed on the message for a long moment.<br>
He thought about replying. A joke, a shrug, maybe even a proud “Yeah.”<br>
But his fingers didn’t move.</p>
<p>Instead, he locked the screen.</p>
<p>And stood up.</p>
<p>In the corner of his room, a thin GRE prep book leaned sideways on the shelf—creased, scuffed, and opened too many times to count.<br>
He took it, dropped it onto the desk with a soft thud, and opened to a random page.</p>
<p>Reading comprehension. Dense academic language.<br>
A paragraph about evolutionary biology and signal theory.<br>
Exactly the kind of thing that had made his brain knot up when he started months ago.</p>
<p>But this time, he didn’t hesitate.</p>
<p>He sat up straighter.<br>
And began to read aloud.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“In animal behavior, a signal is any act or structure that alters the behavior of another organism…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His accent was thick. Some words stuck like stones in his throat.</p>
<p>He stumbled over “intraspecific.” Mispronounced “evolutionary.”<br>
Paused. Then started again.<br>
Slower. Clearer.</p>
<p>There was no audience here. No teacher to correct him.<br>
Just the empty room and the rhythm of quiet effort.</p>
<p>And still—he kept going.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“These signals, whether visual, auditory, or chemical, serve as evolutionary tools of survival and selection…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His voice cracked near the end of the sentence.<br>
He stopped—not because of a mistake, but because something in his chest tightened.</p>
<p>He looked down at the page.<br>
The black print blurred slightly.<br>
He blinked hard, rubbed at his eyes. No use.<br>
The ache wasn’t in the eyes—it was deeper.</p>
<p>He leaned back. Stared at the peeling ceiling of the tiny room.<br>
Somewhere, a neighbor’s kettle whistled.<br>
A dog barked once in the alleyway below.<br>
And everything inside him was quiet.</p>
<p>Not peaceful.<br>
Just… heavy.</p>
<p>He wasn’t crying.<br>
But he wasn’t far from it.</p>
<p>A familiar voice echoed in his head.<br>
Clearer than anything else in that room.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>“You’re too emotional for this path. Academia… it’s for people with tougher skin.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>She hadn’t meant it cruelly when she said it.<br>
But it had stayed with him.<br>
Strangely, it stuck even more than <em>“I love you.”</em></p>
<p>His hands clenched the edge of the table.<br>
The silence returned. This time, heavier.</p>
<p>He didn’t scream. Didn’t throw the book.<br>
But his eyes moved to the wall—where old sticky notes, scribbled formulas, and quotes were scattered.</p>
<p>And suddenly, he reached for a pen.</p>
<p>In the corner of a blue post-it, he wrote in sharp black ink:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>“Strong is quiet. Brave is small. But still continues.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He pinned it to the wall.<br>
Between “GRE word list #3” and “Machine Learning derivation notes.”</p>
<p>He stared at it.<br>
Then sat back down.</p>
<p>And turned the page.</p>
<p>The next passage was even harder.</p>
<p>Dense academic vocabulary.<br>
Passive voice. Long, winding clauses.<br>
Exactly the kind of English that made his brain stall, twist, freeze.</p>
<p>He hesitated.<br>
Then — one breath.<br>
And another.</p>
<p>His voice was quiet but steady now.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The complexity of social cognition in non-human primates suggests an evolutionary substrate for human empathy…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each word landed like a footstep across ice.<br>
Delicate. Intentional. Uncertain, but forward.</p>
<p>The sentence ended.</p>
<p>He looked up again.</p>
<p>No applause.<br>
No reward.<br>
But something inside him… didn’t sink this time.</p>
<p>He glanced at the post-it note again.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Still continues.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The room still felt small.<br>
Still felt quiet.<br>
Still smelled like instant coffee and faded paper.</p>
<p>But he had moved.</p>
<p>Not far. Not fast.<br>
But he had moved.</p>
<p>And maybe, in this kind of life — in the slow becoming of something — that was enough.</p>
<hr>
<p>The room was still.</p>
<p>He sat quietly, his eyes drifting between the books in front of him and the words now echoing in his mind.</p>
<p>Not from a professor.<br>
Not from a textbook.<br>
But from her.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“You’re emotionally too soft for academia.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She hadn’t said it to hurt him.<br>
Not exactly.</p>
<p>It was in one of those long conversations — the kind that turn into arguments without anyone meaning to.</p>
<p>She had been tired.<br>
He had been defensive.<br>
And somewhere between caring and frustration, she let it slip.</p>
<p>But words like that don’t just <em>slip away</em>.<br>
They stay.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes. He could still see her face that day.<br>
The furrow in her brow.<br>
The worry behind the anger.</p>
<p>She didn’t say it because she hated him.</p>
<p>She said it because she didn’t think he would survive the world he wanted to step into.</p>
<p>And maybe… maybe part of him believed it, too.</p>
<p>He leaned back in his chair, letting the weight of her voice settle into the quiet.</p>
<p>Outside, the city was waking up slowly — a distant motorbike, the clatter of someone unlocking a gate.</p>
<p>But inside, it was still just him… and that sentence.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“You’re emotionally too soft for academia.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He had replayed it too many times.<br>
Like a scar he couldn’t stop touching.<br>
Like a mirror that only showed what was broken.</p>
<p>He wasn’t the loudest in seminars.<br>
He wasn’t quick with comebacks.<br>
When the first professor scoffed at his statement during a journal club, he just sat there — flushed, hands shaking, voice too dry to speak.</p>
<p>And now, he wondered…<br>
Had she seen it before he did?<br>
That maybe, deep down, he wasn’t made for this?</p>
<p>But then —<br>
Something sparked.<br>
Something small.</p>
<p>His eyes caught the edge of a bright yellow post-it note on the shelf.<br>
A scrap he’d written in the haze of one long night when he wanted to quit but didn’t.</p>
<p>He reached for it.</p>
<p>Bent edges. Slanted ink. But still readable.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Strong is quiet. Brave is small. But still continues.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He held it.<br>
Read it again.<br>
And again.</p>
<p>Like a vow whispered only to himself.</p>
<hr>
<p>The metal latch clicked softly as he slid the window open.</p>
<p>A breath of cool air drifted in, carrying the scent of wet concrete and faraway exhaust — the unmistakable perfume of early morning in the city.</p>
<p>Outside, the buildings stood like silent sentinels in the fog.<br>
They were gray. Distant. Almost weightless in the mist.</p>
<p>From his tiny room, the world looked… blurred.<br>
But not empty.</p>
<p>He rested his hands on the windowsill, elbows slightly trembling, either from the chill or the hours he hadn’t slept. His breath left a small cloud on the glass.</p>
<p>For a moment, there were no books.<br>
No rejections.<br>
No comparisons.<br>
No her.</p>
<p>Just him.<br>
And the city, stretching beyond reach.</p>
<p>He looked at the horizon, where the fog thinned.<br>
A faint line of orange appeared — not quite sunrise, not yet.</p>
<p>And he whispered to the morning air:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“One day… one day I’ll make it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The vow wasn’t loud.<br>
It didn’t need to be.</p>
<p>It wasn’t for anyone else.<br>
It was for the version of him that still believed.<br>
The one buried beneath the tired eyes, the slow progress, the heartbreak.</p>

<p>If you’re building a Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) system using Quarto, and you want to combine a central website with multiple structured books (like “Convex Optimization”, “Statistics”, etc.), this guide shows you the best practices to:</p>
<p>Organize your folder structure</p>
<p>Set up separate Quarto projects</p>
<p>Render efficiently without duplication</p>
<p>Publish to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions</p>
<p>You can use my PKM for easier to begin:</p>
<section id="pkm-structure-overview" class="level1">
<h1>PKM Structure Overview</h1>
<p>My knowledge system follow this hierarchy:</p>
<p>Subject → Book → Chapter → Section</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Subject: Mathematics
<ul>
<li>Book: Convex Optimization
<ul>
<li>Chapter: Convex Sets
<ul>
<li>Sections: Definitions, Examples, Properties</li>

<p>To preview the full site:</p>

<p>It will view book as website.</p>
<p>If you want to preview full site with books, we will render site before, and after that, render book. So old file of website-books will be replaced by book file.</p>

<p>Bad gateway: <img src="https://kimhungbui.github.io/posts/nextcloud-install/Pasted image 20250523111025.png" class="img-fluid"> Because your Portainer HTTPS endpoint is using a self-signed certificate, Cloudflared (by default) will try to validate it—and fail—so you get a 502 even though curl -vk https://127.0.0.1:9443 works locally.</p>
<p>Here’s how to fix that when you’re using the Web Dashboard to manage your tunnel:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Enable “Disable TLS Verification” on the Hostname In the Cloudflare dashboard go to Zero Trust → Access → Tunnels.</li>
</ol>
<p>Click your tunnel, then open the Public hostnames tab.</p>
<p>Find the row for portainer.kimhungbui.com and click Edit.</p>
<p>Under Origin Connection you should see a toggle or checkbox labeled something like “Disable TLS verification” (or “Skip certificate validation”).</p>
<p>Enable that option and save.</p>
<p>This tells Cloudflared not to reject your Portainer’s self-signed cert.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="early-retirement-journey-and-financial-strategies">Early Retirement Journey and Financial Strategies</h2>
<ul>
<li>Tim, a man from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regina,_Saskatchewan">Regina, Saskatchewan</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada">Canada</a>, retired from engineering at the age of 39, after 11 years of planning and working towards his goal of early retirement, and his wife plans to retire from her childcare career in a few years <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yNsKxbq0Ak&amp;t=7s">(00:00:07)</a>.</li>
<li>Tim’s family achieved early retirement through a financial strategy known as FIRE, which involves drastically reducing spending, saving a large percentage of income, and investing the savings <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yNsKxbq0Ak&amp;t=20s">(00:00:20)</a>.</li>
<li>Tim first considered the idea of early retirement in 2006 and started saving money, cutting costs, and figuring out what matters to him and his family <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yNsKxbq0Ak&amp;t=53s">(00:00:53)</a>.</li>
<li>When Tim and his wife started working towards early retirement, they had student loan debt and other financial issues, but they paid off their existing debt and then focused on reducing their spending <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yNsKxbq0Ak&amp;t=72s">(00:01:12)</a>.</li>
</ul>

<section id="spending-reduction-and-financial-management" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="spending-reduction-and-financial-management">Spending Reduction and Financial Management</h2>
<ul>
<li>To reduce their spending, Tim and his wife looked at their bills, such as their power bill, and found ways to lower them, such as changing to LED lightbulbs <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yNsKxbq0Ak&amp;t=108s">(00:01:48)</a>.</li>
<li>They also reduced their grocery bill by buying generic versions of products and making things from scratch, which often tasted better and saved them money <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yNsKxbq0Ak&amp;t=122s">(00:02:02)</a>.</li>
<li>Tim and his wife have a focused approach to spending, only eating out a couple of times a year, and making sure their spending is aligned with what matters to them <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yNsKxbq0Ak&amp;t=151s">(00:02:31)</a>.</li>
<li>Tim uses a phrase to help him avoid overspending, which is to ask himself if he really needs something and if he can solve a problem without spending money <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yNsKxbq0Ak&amp;t=173s">(00:02:53)</a>.</li>
<li>Tim and his wife have paid off their mortgage and car loans in advance, which has helped them in their retirement <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yNsKxbq0Ak&amp;t=203s">(00:03:23)</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li>The individual has achieved extreme early retirement at the age of 39, with a significant amount of assets and no debt, and currently resides in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regina,_Saskatchewan">Regina, Saskatchewan</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada">Canada</a>, where housing costs are relatively low, with an average housing cost of around $278,000 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yNsKxbq0Ak&amp;t=230s">(00:03:50)</a>.</li>
<li>The majority of their investments are in straightforward strategies, including exchange-traded funds that mirror major indexes, allowing for a simple and low-maintenance approach to managing their finances <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yNsKxbq0Ak&amp;t=241s">(00:04:01)</a>.</li>
<li>Despite the simplicity of their investment strategy, they still experience worries about the stock market, but have trained themselves not to check it frequently, focusing instead on long-term performance rather than short-term fluctuations <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yNsKxbq0Ak&amp;t=251s">(00:04:11)</a>.</li>
<li>Initially, they found the wild gyrations of the stock market to be psychologically challenging, and having a larger cushion would have been helpful for peace of mind <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yNsKxbq0Ak&amp;t=267s">(00:04:27)</a>.</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="challenges-and-adaptation-in-early-retirement">Challenges and Adaptation in Early Retirement</h2>
<ul>
<li>One of the downsides of early retirement is the unusual conversations with people who question their decision to retire at a young age, leading them to reframe their explanation to focus on pursuing a writing career <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yNsKxbq0Ak&amp;t=284s">(00:04:44)</a>.</li>
<li>They started a blog in 2006 to document their early retirement journey, which includes their doubts, learning experiences, and mistakes, and also wrote a book called “Three at Forty Five” to discuss the importance of happiness in early retirement <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yNsKxbq0Ak&amp;t=297s">(00:04:57)</a>.</li>
<li>The first year of early retirement was problematic, involving a major lifestyle change and a process of deprogramming themselves to realize they didn’t have to work as much, and instead focus on enjoyable activities <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yNsKxbq0Ak&amp;t=329s">(00:05:29)</a>.</li>
<li>To cope with the transition, they created to-do lists that included fun items, and have pursued various hobbies such as making their own wine and beer, playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_&amp;_Dragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a>, and creating terrain pieces <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yNsKxbq0Ak&amp;t=352s">(00:05:52)</a>.</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="family-life-and-financial-education-for-children">Family Life and Financial Education for Children</h2>
<ul>
<li>They have been married for 19 years and have two sons, aged 14 and 11, and have taught them about money management, focusing on delayed gratification, saving, and responsible spending <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yNsKxbq0Ak&amp;t=383s">(00:06:23)</a>.</li>
<li>They gave their children an allowance from a young age and allowed them to spend it on whatever they wanted, teaching them valuable lessons about money management <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yNsKxbq0Ak&amp;t=407s">(00:06:47)</a>.</li>
<li>A strategy was implemented to teach children the value of saving money by explaining that waiting to buy something now can lead to affording bigger things later, resulting in two kids who default to saving money without knowing what they’re saving for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yNsKxbq0Ak&amp;t=437s">(00:07:17)</a>.</li>
<li>A friend’s advice was taken to heart, which stated that kids are a constant drain on finances, but the expenses change as they age, and it’s essential to get used to it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yNsKxbq0Ak&amp;t=463s">(00:07:43)</a>.</li>
<li>A system was set up to take out cash every month for the kids and put it aside, which averaged out to the same amount of money over the course of the year, with the wife managing the cash flow to prepare for upcoming expenses like winter boots <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yNsKxbq0Ak&amp;t=469s">(00:07:49)</a>.</li>
<li>Registered education savings plans were saved for the kids’ college and university education, which was fully filled before leaving work, allowing the money to grow in interest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yNsKxbq0Ak&amp;t=498s">(00:08:18)</a>.</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="wifes-continued-work-and-financial-planning">Wife’s Continued Work and Financial Planning</h2>
<ul>
<li>The wife decided to continue working, which was factored into the plan, assuming she would work for a few more years to offset some of the spending and provide an extra cushion <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yNsKxbq0Ak&amp;t=530s">(00:08:50)</a>.</li>
<li>A plan was written out in advance to prepare for potential stock market declines, including options like taking a loan or getting a part-time job, to help stay calm and rational during emotional times <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yNsKxbq0Ak&amp;t=568s">(00:09:28)</a>.</li>
<li>Having a written plan helped to prepare for a major stock market decline a year into retirement, which ultimately worked out well in the long run <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yNsKxbq0Ak&amp;t=548s">(00:09:08)</a>.</li>
<li>It’s recommended to write out an investment plan while calm and rational to prepare for potential future declines and have a clear plan of action <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yNsKxbq0Ak&amp;t=577s">(00:09:37)</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li>The family’s current home is a daycare, which is quite spacious, and they plan to downsize in the long term, with any savings from lower taxes, water bills, and other expenses being used to offset potential losses <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yNsKxbq0Ak&amp;t=614s">(00:10:14)</a>.</li>
<li>Living in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada">Canada</a> provides benefits such as government-paid healthcare costs, which have been over-contributed to, covering basic healthcare costs, but not dental, prescription eyewear, or other expenses that are self-insured and paid out-of-pocket <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yNsKxbq0Ak&amp;t=640s">(00:10:40)</a>.</li>
<li>Government benefits like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_Pension_Plan">Canada Pension Plan</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Age_Security">Old Age Security</a> are factored into long-term plans, but with conservative assumptions, such as only one spouse collecting Old Age Security <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yNsKxbq0Ak&amp;t=665s">(00:11:05)</a>.</li>

<li>A job at the local library was taken to work with great people, enjoy the work, and earn a supplemental income, which is used to fund extra activities, and has helped achieve a better work-life balance <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yNsKxbq0Ak&amp;t=690s">(00:11:30)</a>.</li>
<li>Reduced working hours have improved overall happiness, and retirement has provided extra time to focus on desired activities and spend quality time with family, particularly children <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yNsKxbq0Ak&amp;t=730s">(00:12:10)</a>.</li>
